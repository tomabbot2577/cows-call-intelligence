    "text": "Okay, I don't know what happened there. Okay, can you hold for one minute? Sure. Okay. Okay, thank you. Okay. So in the chat area, I sent a different URL. I want to see if this one works. In the chat area. Yeah, the chat area of the meeting should be down at the bottom right. bottom right I don't see what you're talking about if you go back to the meeting window and if you open it in Chrome or edge now there okay it says stop sharing okay okay but hover on there okay open up that and then see down at the very bottom right it's right after the three people or the two people Chat with everyone? Yeah, click on that. Copy that URL that I just sent you. I want to see if this works. Okay. Okay, let's go back to, okay, copy that URL in there. Hit go. Oh, that's better. Yeah. I think I just said. Except it doesn't give me the right database. It doesn't give me the main. ESI underscore main underscore new is the database that I have access to. Oh, wait a minute. Did I pull up the wrong customer? Debbie Schumacher, electronic search. See, like, when I go here, I have this ESI main. I don't have any other login. Is there an electronic search? Can you do me a favor? Can you go ahead and log in there? Sure. Quota system. This usually means it's a database hosted on your own servers. Oh, I don't think you're going to have access to this. Is this a self-hosted, not one that we host? I don't know. It might be self-hosted on our, how do I know? Oh, API. Yeah, but it wouldn't be that. So there's like a link. how it's going to be listed. But you just don't have access to generate the link that we need. Yeah, when I asked my admin, she said I can't go on here. It ends in .txt. Yeah, that's in one of them, but that's not what she gave me. What did she send you? because what you're seeing is kind of like if it's a self-hosted database meaning it's on your own servers what you're seeing is kind of like a master version of the actual path that we need okay just one second let me the url that i asked her was https blah blah pcr.electronicsearch.com okay what they'll need to do somebody that's an administrator because you're you don't have access to it. Okay. If they go under system, I just type the word links in the search box. I don't understand what you mean. Hold on. I need to see what you're talking about. In here? Yeah. If they type links and then it will return PCR website links. Then there's going to be an option called application URL. Wait. Hold on. Links. Search. I don't have access. Yeah. So, okay. So hold on. Go back to after I do search links, then it says what? Then it'll say PCR website links and they'll give you, they'll need to give you what's it's really the first one. It'll be listed. It'll be listed as PC recruiter application URL. PC recruiter application URL. Yeah. That's going to be like the full link. you're kind of seeing like a master version of it. Okay. So my administrator meaning Aaron. Okay, good. Yeah. And then I try that, and if it doesn't work, I call you guys back? Yes. Okay. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah, I can't tell you what it is because I don't have the access to it, but usually it ends in .txt. .txt. Well, I have that, actually, because. Yeah, where do you have that? It's not like when I, let's see, when I go to this screen, why is it not letting me do this stuff here? This, oh, I need to get out of that. And then this is. But you have to go first, you have to go add connection. I know, but when I hit add connection, it takes me to this, which I can't do. So do you want me to type that in there? So whatever that TXT link that she'll have to give you, you paste that in, hit go, then it'll take you to the login page for the database that's on your own server. Because it sounds like you're trying to connect to one that's on your own server. No, it's usually longer than that. Yeah, she'll have to get that for you. Yeah, okay, you can't reach that. Okay, okay, so I just wanted to make sure that wasn't the one. Okay, perfect. Yeah, once you get that, give me a call back. My extension is 5-4-6-6. 5-4-6-6. Okay. Okay. And then we'll finish up that setup. Okay. All right. All righty. Have a good day. Talk to you soon. Okay. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.",

--> 00:02:26,944\nSure.\n\n36\n00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,564\nQuota system.\n\n37\n00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,758\nThis usually means it's a database hosted on your own servers.\n\n38\n00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,079\nOh, I don't think you're going to have access to this.\n\n39\n00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,058\nIs this a self-hosted, not one that we host?\n\n40\n00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:43,657\nI don't know.\n\n41\n00:02:45,043 --> 00:02:48,553\nIt might be self-hosted on our, how do I know?\n\n42\n00:02:51,408 --> 00:02:51,820\nOh, API.\n\n43\n00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:53,737\nYeah, but it wouldn't be that.\n\n44\n00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:54,976\nSo there's like a link.\n\n45\n00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,117\nhow it's going to be listed.\n\n46\n00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,252\nBut you just don't have access to generate the link that we need.\n\n47\n00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,384\nYeah, when I asked my admin, she said I can't go on here.\n\n48\n00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,272\nIt ends in .txt.\n\n49\n00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,367\nYeah, that's in one of them, but that's not what she gave me.\n\n50\n00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,660\nWhat did she send you?\n\n51\n00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,644\nbecause what you're seeing is kind of like if it's a self-hosted database meaning\n\n52\n00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:36,789\nit's on your own servers what you're seeing is kind of like a master version of the\n\n53\n00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:44,354\nactual path that we need okay just one second let me the url that i asked her was\n\n54\n00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:48,977\nhttps blah blah pcr.electronicsearch.com okay what they'll need to do somebody\n\n55\n00:03:48,977 --> 00:03:53,600\nthat's an administrator because you're you don't have access to it.\n\n56\n00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:54,500\nOkay.\n\n57\n00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,960\nIf they go under system, I just type the word links in the search box.\n\n58\n00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,100\nI don't understand what you mean.\n\n59\n00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,540\nHold on.\n\n60\n00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680\nI need to see what you're talking about.\n\n61\n00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,200\nIn here?\n\n62\n00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,120\nYeah.\n\n63\n00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,940\nIf they type links and then it will return PCR website links.\n\n64\n00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,960\nThen there's going to be an option called application URL.\n\n65\n00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:16,760\nWait.\n\n66\n00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,280\nHold on.\n\n67\n00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,020\nLinks.\n\n68\n00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,220\nSearch.\n\n69\n00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,700\nI don't have access.\n\n70\n00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,260\nYeah.\n\n71\n00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,360\nSo, okay.\n\n72\n00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,800\nSo hold on.\n\n73\n00:04:27,920 -->",
