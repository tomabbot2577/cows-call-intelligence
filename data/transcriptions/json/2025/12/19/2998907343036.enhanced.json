When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hey Glenn, it's Jim Lombardo, PC recruiter. Got your voicemail on Friday. I wanted to give you a quick call back. I can get you moved back up and what I can do, you were at kind of a middle ground there. So you're right now on the enterprise, which does not contain the email campaigns. you had been on premium plus which included the AI suite at 235 so what I can do is I can actually increase you to the premium not the premium plus so the premium does not include the AI suite or any of that but it does include the email campaigns that you're looking for that one it was you were at 210 per user per month as opposed to 235 so that can save you a little bit of money but still get you the functionality you need I will drop you an email just to confirm that that's what you want to do I've got an email I think from Suzanne that I I will email back CCU and I can get that email over to you to sign the new agreement, get you back up to the premium package rather than the premium plus, save you a little bit of money still. If you get this or you have any questions, give me a call at 440-856-0314. Or if you'd rather reply to my email, you can do that too. And I'll send you over a fresh paperwork if and when you're ready. Thank you, sir. Take care. Bye-bye.",
