    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Eric at Comcentric. Hey, how's it going, Eric? Okay. I had an issue come up yesterday. I don't know if it's an inhaler issue or if Monster changed the format of the resumes that are coming in. But I'm getting an exception error when I try to use the inhaler application as of yesterday. So I don't know if you can help me troubleshoot that or if you experienced anything on your end or heard anything on your end. I haven't heard anything on my end. Let's hop on a quick screen share so I can see that error. Because more than likely it's just the formatting of their resumes. Because I know I do change stuff quite often. Let me start up a video leading here. Yeah, the inhaler won't even operate at all, which is weird. Usually if they change the format, it'll put them in a bad folder or something, which isn't an error I'm getting. Where do I need to go? Is it a website I think I go to? I'm just emailing you the link here. Okay. Just send that link on over to you. Gotcha. I know we were having some emails, issues with Monster because they're merging with career builder so that's one of the issues and then as soon as we got the resumes to start sending then they won't inhale yeah one thing all right we can't access your microphone you could just exit out of that no just makes it out of that we're already on the phone here okay and then just do the continue without audio and then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window to share, you want to share your entire screen. All right. All righty. Okay. Now, you have it going to a forward? Yeah. So here's the folder. It has all these resumes. Here's the first batch that came in at 1233. These ones inhaled fine. And then there was a delay in Monster for like an hour. and then these 63 showed up. Actually, they were delayed, but they showed up, and it showed that they were received beforehand or sent earlier. It's weird because it's showing they were sent, but they weren't received until later, so I don't know, they got slowed down through the Internet somewhere. But anyway, they're in this folder. They should inhale, right? So if I go to the inhaler app, I restarted and made sure there was no issues. I also ran an update on the inhaler to make sure that something didn't change with the inhaler. Mapped it, remapped it to the folder just to make sure if something broke with the link. None of those things fixed it. So if I go here to import from email now, you'll see this exception pops up. If you click the details, here is the... Scroll down if you want so you can see the whole thing or I can copy it to a message. Have you seen this before? I have not. Go ahead and scroll down in there for me. Keep going. Go ahead and hit continue. Go to a... I'll go back into the inhaler. Then go to about up at the top. Then registration. Okay, that looks good. Go ahead and just hit register again there. Did that yesterday too. Then actions. Then connection settings. I did that yesterday. Go ahead and okay. Did I reconnect it maybe? That all looks good. Yeah, let's give it another try. You know what? We have third-party authentication, so I'm wondering if that's possible. Maybe you needed a refresh. Go. Maybe www.pcrecruiter.net. I'm saying it's not opening. It's weird. Let me go here. and let me take a look at my end here okay if i pasted it allows it to yeah something's not allowing this to connect Thank you. I'm just checking on my end here too. You said this just started happening yesterday? Yep. Thank you. I'm just waiting for it here on my end to load up. Thank you. Yeah, loaded up on mine. Have you tried restarting the computer at all? Yep, I've done it twice. Yeah, so it looks like there's something blocking that page from loading there for you. Can you completely exit out of the inhaler for me? Then go ahead and open it back up there. Then go to Actions, Connection Settings. Then do the quick here to connect database again for me. Then hit go. That's odd. It's like something on your computer is blocking it. Because when I did mine, it loaded right up and let me do that screen. Okay. All right, go ahead and exit out of this box here. Then let's try reconnecting that folder again too. It's taking a second to populate it. but a lot of different folders took even that doesn't seem to be working oh no I did that okay all right so I reconnected that folder yep let's do the import yep go to details again for me Close me up. Where are the details? The connection settings? No, do the import from email now and then the details and the error. Go all the way down for me. me then go up a little bit keep going okay go ahead and keep going up there oh Everything looks okay. Go ahead and hit quit one more time. Now, do you have, like, a firewall or, like, a VPN or anything that you use? I think we do, yeah. For which one? for which one? Yeah, like are you using a firewall, not a VPN? I know we have a firewall here, yeah. Okay. Can you go ahead and go back into your Outlook for me? Let me look at the ones that say imported. You know what the difference is? Do you see this as external? Yep. And the ones that imported? So let me see. So it shows an external tag, right? I'm sending it to my IT. so it has to be a security setting then right i would think so yeah like within my email it's a it's a microsoft security setting microsoft 365 security setting I yeah with that external tag let me see if I can find which one do you see that these ones imported fine and the ones that came some of them say external on them I don't know what distinguishes them from the other ones I'm wondering if they were updating something and that's why there was the delay yeah but it's weird some of these external things and internal versus external have these weird little tags i don't know yeah so email is coming in with an external tag in microsoft 365 the security feature implemented by your it administrator to alert you that the message originally it's from outside of your organization. But why are some of them... Well, I'm wondering if that's why they're... I'm guessing that might have been why there was a little bit of a delay. Maybe they were upgrading, like, security settings for you. Who, Monster or... Or whoever you're on. Because that external tag is controlled by that. It's intermittently been coming on and off. Oh, with the external tag? Yeah, over the last week or two. Well, that's interesting. I'll tell my guy that. Yeah, I would say have them check those settings first. and see if that's causing the issue. And what you can always do for these ones is if you download the resumes and put them all in a folder on your desktop, you can just have the inhaler. yeah but that for me to take 63 resumes go into a manually save that into a folder and then it I mean I can that's a workaround but it will take me an hour just to do the thing and the purpose of being Hiller so just to streamline that so yep yes I would say contact your IP see what's going on with those tags because it seems like you said the ones that are that don't have that external tag important just fine but as soon as that external tag pops in there it's thrown errors when it's trying to connect to the email folder I'm gonna text my photo of that All right. So that sounds like an issue internally, so I should check on that. And if we can't resolve it, should I call you back then? Yep. Yeah, just give us a call back. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yep, no problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye.",

help you?\n\n4\n00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,135\nHey, Tyler.\n\n5\n00:00:06,503 --> 00:00:07,619\nThis is Eric at Comcentric.\n\n6\n00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,356\nHey, how's it going, Eric?\n\n7\n00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:11,518\nOkay.\n\n8\n00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,372\nI had an issue come up yesterday.\n\n9\n00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:19,575\nI don't know if it's an inhaler issue or if Monster changed the format of the\n\n10\n00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:20,839\nresumes that are coming in.\n\n11\n00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,938\nBut I'm getting an exception error when I try to use the inhaler application as of\n\n12\n00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:27,360\nyesterday.\n\n13\n00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,854\nSo I don't know if you can help me troubleshoot that or if you experienced anything\n\n14\n00:00:32,095 --> 00:00:33,640\non your end or heard anything on your end.\n\n15\n00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:35,991\nI haven't heard anything on my end.\n\n16\n00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:41,136\nLet's hop on a quick screen share so I can see that error.\n\n17\n00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,380\nBecause more than likely it's just the formatting of their resumes.\n\n18\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,919\nBecause I know I do change stuff quite often.\n\n19\n00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,100\nLet me start up a video leading here.\n\n20\n00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:56,980\nYeah, the inhaler won't even operate at all, which is weird.\n\n21\n00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:00,531\nUsually if they change the format,\n\n22\n00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:01,895\nit'll put them in a bad folder or something,\n\n23\n00:01:02,055 --> 00:01:03,540\nwhich isn't an error I'm getting.\n\n24\n00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,860\nWhere do I need to go?\n\n25\n00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,671\nIs it a website I think I go to?\n\n26\n00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:09,935\nI'm just emailing you the link here.\n\n27\n00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:11,774\nOkay.\n\n28\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,320\nJust send that link on over to you.\n\n29\n00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:20,915\nGotcha.\n\n30\n00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,984\nI know we were having some emails,\n\n31\n00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:08,328\nissues with Monster because they're merging with career builder so that's one of\n\n32\n00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:12,792\nthe issues and then as soon as we got the resumes to start sending then they won't\n\n33\n00:02:12,812 --> 00:02:15,894\ninhale yeah one thing all right we can't access your microphone you could just exit\n\n34\n00:02:15,914 --> 00:02:18,076\nout of that no just makes it out of that we're already on the phone here okay and\n\n35\n00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,998\nthen just do the continue without audio and then you'll see a blue box at the\n\n36\n00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:22,459\nbottom of the meeting window to share,\n\n37\n00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,740\nyou want to share your entire screen.\n\n38\n00:02:27,282 --> 00:02:27,584\nAll right.\n\n39\n00:02:30,043 --> 00:02:30,550\nAll righty.\n\n40\n00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:32,737\nOkay.\n\n41\n00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,374\nNow, you have it going to a forward?\n\n42\n00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,245\nYeah.\n\n43\n00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:38,640\nSo here's the folder.\n\n44\n00:02:39,163 --> 00:02:39,772\nIt has all these resumes.\n\n45\n00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,740\nHere's the first batch that came in at 1233.\n\n46\n00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,438\nThese ones inhaled fine.\n\n47\n00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,015\nAnd then there was a delay in Monster for like an hour.\n\n48\n00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,567\nand then these 63 showed up.\n\n49\n00:02:58,807 --> 00:02:59,128\nActually,\n\n50\n00:02:59,148 --> 00:02:59,489\nthey were delayed,\n\n51\n00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,870\nbut they showed up,\n\n52\n00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,780\nand it showed that they were received beforehand or sent earlier.\n\n53\n00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,586\nIt's weird because it's showing they were sent,\n\n54\n00:03:05,606 --> 00:03:06,349\nbut they weren't received until later,\n\n55\n00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:06,951\nso I don't know,\n\n56\n00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,660\nthey got slowed down through the Internet somewhere.\n\n57\n00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,159\nBut anyway, they're in this folder.\n\n58\n00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,119\nThey should inhale, right?\n\n59\n00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,578\nSo if I go to the inhaler app, I restarted and made sure there was no issues.\n\n60\n00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,039\nI also ran an update on the inhaler to make sure that something didn't change with\n\n61\n00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:21,280\nthe inhaler.\n\n62\n00:03:23,968 --> 00:03:24,169\nMapped it,\n\n63\n00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,600\nremapped it to the folder just to make sure if something broke with the link.\n\n64\n00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:28,260\nNone of those things fixed it.\n\n65\n00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,729\nSo if I go here to import from email now, you'll see this exception pops up.\n\n66\n00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,637\nIf you click the details, here is the...\n\n67\n00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,927\nScroll down if you want so you can see the whole thing or I can copy it to a\n\n68\n00:03:41,947 --> 00:03:42,0",
