    "text": "Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Jason, she's dialing right in. Hello, Jason. Oh, I'm so sorry. No problem. Yep, I'm still here. Awesome. Excellent. Yeah. So I'm glad we have you. Kate, I'd like to introduce Jason, who is also on the call here. He's going to be your trainer. for PC Recruiter. Okay. Alrighty, so what we're gonna do today is just run through kind of a quick few questions about PC Recruiter, about your use, about your setup, about your network and everything like that. And then at the end of the call, Jason will get a couple of training scheduled for you, hopefully before you go to training on the sixth for Dimensional Search. Okay. Okay, so I would be the person, If you need to add users down the line, if you have any contract questions, or if you don't know who to talk to about anything you need here at PC Recruiter, contact me. I can get you to the right person or help you. And Jason's going to be the one who will get you trained up on the system. And I'm going to turn everything over to him to run through the questions that he has for you. Okay. Hi, Catherine. I'm Jason. Like Jim said, I'm going to be handling all of that training stuff with PC Recruiter. The questions I have today are just going to kind of help guide our training session so I understand your needs as a user and all of that fun stuff. The first question I have is going to be, what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing? Like permanent placement, contract placing? What are you thinking? Permanent placement. Okay. Cool. And what industry or niche are you going to be focusing in? Humanitarian aid. Awesome. And have you worked as a recruiter before? No. No? Okay. Have you worked with an ATS or a CRM before? Yes. Okay. Do you mind me asking which one? I have worked with Kindful, and I currently work with Bloomerang, and then I helped set one up. I couldn't tell you what the name was anymore, but it was for... I have all the HIPAA requirements. Okay. Okay, cool. Awesome. So we have some experience. In the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? Yes. My husband will come with me. Okay, perfect. Whenever that happens, just let Jim know and he can assist with all of that fun stuff. Okay. So with our trainings, there are three different levels, speeds that we can go at. There is fast, there is moderate, there is slow. Fast is three sessions a week, moderate is two, and slow is one. Each session is going to be an hour long. I know there's a little bit of, in this initial phase of things, we want to make sure we get those two trainings in, two to three, before you begin dimensional search training on the sixth. But just generally, how quick do you think you want to go? Like, how many trainings a week do you think you could handle? I have lots of experience working with CRM, so I would say I could probably handle three. Okay. I understand it. Awesome. Okay. What operating system are you using? I use a Mac. Mac. Okay. And your current browser? I think I'm using Chrome right now. Okay. Perfect. And who is your email provider, like Gmail, Microsoft? Microsoft Exchange. Okay. Awesome. Okay. If you're gonna answer myself. Okay, and so typically with the dimensional search folks, where they are with things is, you have the intention of having a website, but that is not complete yet. Is that where you are? Yep. Okay, perfect. Okay. So why don't we take a look and see what we can get scheduled? I'm pretty booked out the rest of the week, but I could get Monday started. First off, what time zone are you in? I'm in Eastern. Eastern? Perfect. Is there a certain timeframe that works best for you? After 3 p.m. typically, I'm still working full time. Okay. Why don't we say 4 p.m. on Monday? Would that work for you? Yes. Okay. Okay. And how about Wednesday at 4 p.m. as well? Does that work? No, I can't do Wednesday at 4. I get to do Wednesday from 3 to 4. I could do that. Okay, Wednesday 3 to 4. Okay. And let's just throw another one on there just to be safe. How is Friday for you that week? That's a great time. I don't have many meetings on Fridays. Perfect. Why don't we say again three to four on Friday? Perfect. All right. So I'm going to send over some meeting requests to you for these. The meeting, the invite that we sent to you for this, was that your business email or was it your personal? Is it mountaintop search? Let me check. Okay. No, it was not. So, I think we might still need to grab your work email. k.gahl at mountaintopsearch.com. Okay. K.GAHL at mountaintopsearch.com. Yep. Perfect. Okay. I'll get these sent over to you. Just to kind of prepare you for that first training session, the first one is fairly administrative. It's a lot of setup, like getting your user created, email connected, all that fun stuff. But after that first session, we will dive into course material. Yeah, I believe Dimensional Search typically likes to have two training sessions in. I usually don't consider that first one a training session. And it's just kind of like we're getting stuff set up. So getting those other two next week also will be really helpful just to provide more context before you go into the dimensional search side of things. But before, do you have any specific questions for me? Anything? No, I was working with dimensional yesterday and it was fine. Okay, perfect. Jim, do you have anything else? No, I'm all good. I have nothing more. Okay, awesome. Then I will see you on Monday, Katherine. Thank you. I look forward to it. Appreciate your time, Jason. Awesome. I'll see you then. Bye. Bye-bye.",
