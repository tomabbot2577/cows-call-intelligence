    "text": "This is Robin. Hey, Robin. My name is James. Karen has been a client for, I don't know, like 11 years now. I just noticed when I go to PCR capture, if I'm on LinkedIn, actually, I've noticed this for a while now. But when I go there and I go to candidate and you know how you can like put them into PCR from there. If they're already in my database, and sometimes even if not, it won't let me choose their current company on LinkedIn. It used to do that. Are you familiar with this? Yeah, it could be just a setting at the top. When you click on the extension at the top right of your browser, that's going to pop up all the links or sites that it supports. At the very bottom right, is basic mode off? Like, is it showing gray or blue? Okay. Sorry. One second. So if I go to – I couldn't see what you were talking about. Okay. So I go to click to update on this guy. No, actually, clicking directly on the extension at the top right of your browser. Oh, okay. I got you. Hold on one second. Yeah, because it's probably a setting. Yep. Okay. Okay, capture. Okay, and then it says basic mode is not on. Capture to default company is what it says right now. Okay, is that on? That's on. Capture to default company is on. If you turn that off so it's gray, like usually you want all of those gray. If you slide that so it's gray, what that will do is let you either create or pick a company. Otherwise, it's trying to put everybody into your default company. Okay, that's extremely helpful. Okay, that's all I need to do. So basic mode, dark mode, don't mess with those. Yeah, oh, definitely don't do basic mode. If it was up to me, I'd take that one out completely. That's for the people that want things to just be super fast and with no review or it's just ads. You never want to do that. I definitely don't want to do that. Yeah, and I'm sorry, how do you spell your last name? C-A-I-R-N-S. Gotcha, okay. That's spelling wrong. Okay, yeah, that was probably the setting. So now you should, and you'll want to definitely watch when you have that capture to default company off. If the company is already found in your database as an exact match, hover on that card and use the checkbox. So that way you're not making any changes to the company by what it's reading from the profile. You're just picking it and adding the person into that company. Got it. Okay. All right. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. That worked. Thank you so much. You are very welcome. That's really helpful. Have a great week. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

00:00:09,879\nKaren has been a client for, I don't know, like 11 years now.\n\n5\n00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,184\nI just noticed when I go to PCR capture,\n\n6\n00:00:12,204 --> 00:00:12,906\nif I'm on LinkedIn,\n\n7\n00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:13,828\nactually,\n\n8\n00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,572\nI've noticed this for a while now.\n\n9\n00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,071\nBut when I go there and I go to candidate and you know how you can like put them\n\n10\n00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:25,632\ninto PCR from there.\n\n11\n00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,202\nIf they're already in my database,\n\n12\n00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:32,745\nand sometimes even if not,\n\n13\n00:00:32,785 --> 00:00:35,709\nit won't let me choose their current company on LinkedIn.\n\n14\n00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:44,299\nIt used to do that.\n\n15\n00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,200\nAre you familiar with this?\n\n16\n00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,558\nYeah, it could be just a setting at the top.\n\n17\n00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,945\nWhen you click on the extension at the top right of your browser,\n\n18\n00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,392\nthat's going to pop up all the links or sites that it supports.\n\n19\n00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,688\nAt the very bottom right, is basic mode off?\n\n20\n00:01:02,203 --> 00:01:03,520\nLike, is it showing gray or blue?\n\n21\n00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:05,520\nOkay.\n\n22\n00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:05,811\nSorry.\n\n23\n00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,460\nOne second.\n\n24\n00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:11,279\nSo if I go to – I couldn't see what you were talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:11,596\nOkay.\n\n26\n00:01:11,781 --> 00:01:12,789\nSo I go to click to update on this guy.\n\n27\n00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:18,474\nNo, actually, clicking directly on the extension at the top right of your browser.\n\n28\n00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:20,568\nOh, okay.\n\n29\n00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:21,697\nI got you.\n\n30\n00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,280\nHold on one second.\n\n31\n00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,199\nYeah, because it's probably a setting.\n\n32\n00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:24,208\nYep.\n\n33\n00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:25,849\nOkay.\n\n34\n00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,009\nOkay, capture.\n\n35\n00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:30,198\nOkay, and then it says basic mode is not on.\n\n36\n00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,120\nCapture to default company is what it says right now.\n\n37\n00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,780\nOkay, is that on?\n\n38\n00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,460\nThat's on.\n\n39\n00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,240\nCapture to default company is on.\n\n40\n00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,760\nIf you turn that off so it's gray, like usually you want all of those gray.\n\n41\n00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,794\nIf you slide that so it's gray,\n\n42\n00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:48,980\nwhat that will do is let you either create or pick a company.\n\n43\n00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,780\nOtherwise, it's trying to put everybody into your default company.\n\n44\n00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,060\nOkay, that's extremely helpful.\n\n45\n00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,680\nOkay, that's all I need to do.\n\n46\n00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,840\nSo basic mode, dark mode, don't mess with those.\n\n47\n00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120\nYeah, oh, definitely don't do basic mode.\n\n48\n00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,000\nIf it was up to me, I'd take that one out completely.\n\n49\n00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,302\nThat's for the people that want things to just be super fast and with no review or\n\n50\n00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:09,160\nit's just ads.\n\n51\n00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,120\nYou never want to do that.\n\n52\n00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,280\nI definitely don't want to do that.\n\n53\n00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,840\nYeah, and I'm sorry, how do you spell your last name?\n\n54\n00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,900\nC-A-I-R-N-S.\n\n55\n00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,260\nGotcha, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,340\nThat's spelling wrong.\n\n57\n00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,980\nOkay, yeah, that was probably the setting.\n\n58\n00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,375\nSo now you should,\n\n59\n00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:31,046\nand you'll want to definitely watch when you have that capture to default company\n\n60\n00:02:31,046 --> 00:02:31,380\noff.\n\n61\n00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,587\nIf the company is already found in your database as an exact match,\n\n62\n00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:37,880\nhover on that card and use the checkbox.\n\n63\n00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,133\nSo that way you're not making any changes to the company by what it's reading from\n\n64\n00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:43,700\nthe profile.\n\n65\n00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,560\nYou're just picking it and adding the person into that company.\n\n66\n00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,080\nGot it.\n\n67\n00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,520\nOkay.\n\n68\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,260\nAll right.\n\n69\n00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:49,640\nPerfect.\n\n70\n00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,500\nPerfect.\n\n71\n00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:50,780\nOkay.\n\n72\n00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,340\nThat worked.\n\n73\n00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,100\nThank you so much.\n\n74\n00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,620\nYou are very welcome.\n\n75\n00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,180\nThat's rea",
