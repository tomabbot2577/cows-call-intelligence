    "text": "Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Yes, I'm trying to. I have PCR. I guess I start. My name is John O'Connor. I'm with Rice Cohen International. Okay. And I'm having a problem with my teams coming up. Like typically when I, you know, set up an appointment, my teams, you know, the button will come, you know, pop up. For some reason, it's not coming on. Oh, well, that would not be a piece recruiter issue. That would be within your Outlook. Do you have the Teams Outlook enabled or the Outlook? I'm sorry, the Teams add-in enabled in your Outlook? Let me see here. Usually if you go to file, options, and then add-ins. Yeah, let me bring this up here. Okay, file, add-ins. Okay, and then there's options. And then go to add-ins. Yeah. Okay, now on the bottom here it has inactive application add-ins. And which one? So there's going to be a listing of your add-ins and if you hit go down at the bottom it'll show all your add-ins. Do you see the teams add-in and is it selected or is it listed with active inactive where like where do you see it? Yeah I don't see it. Okay down at the bottom of that add-in screen where it says manage com add-ins and then click go can you change that drop-down from ManageCon Add-ins to Disabled. Yeah. Okay, then hit go. Yeah. You see it listed there. Disabled. It says no disabled application add-ins. Okay. Inactive applications add-ins. Yeah, I don't see anything. Oh, here's the Teams meeting add-in for Microsoft. Now, it has it as active. Okay. so it should be there but I think you might have to be trying to remember I think you have to be in a like a like maybe your calendar area yeah no no I'm there and I'm trying to put it in and I clicked on it you know it comes up with you know um you know title and but when you look to the top. It's not lit. Like I can't it won't allow me to bring it up. That wouldn't be a piece of recruiter though. Like do you see it in your menu up at the top? Yeah, I see it but you know everything else is kind of lit. Everything else is lit. Like it's sign in is lit and invite attendees or is lit but this one's you know it's dark it's not lit up and you still have the app installed no i don't really use teams and it's not a piece of cruder um issues so i'm trying to figure out um so it's not lit up but you see it okay I definitely, I mean, I see it, but it just won't let me. Let's see, why is it key? So it's there, it's just grayed out. And it's disabled or not installed correctly. To fix this, you must enable add-ins and outlook options. I'm sure Teams is set as a default chat app for Office and Teams meetings. Do you have a desktop app? Yes. what happens when you go in there is there is there a way of like I know typically what they'll do is go in and take it you know they'll disable it and then put it back in that is not something that we would do because this is not related to PC Recruiter. Okay. So I'm better off. Who am I going to with this? Do you have an IT person? Yeah, yeah. I would go to them because I don't want to mess with your outlook and changing things we shouldn't. Because what it's coming up saying is set the Teams as a default chat app for Office. Not really sure what that means. Update Outlook and Teams. repair or reinstall office have you even just tried something simple like restarting your computer i know that sounds like okay i did that i did that a million times yeah every once in a while you never know what that can do yeah yeah no i'm with you yeah i would like your your it person there and just see what they say because i i wouldn't want us to make any adjustments on something that's not a Peace Recruiter product. Okay. All right. Appreciate it. Okay. Sorry, I don't have a better answer for you. Have a good evening, though. All right. Thanks. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",

--> 00:02:06,060\nInactive applications add-ins.\n\n47\n00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,820\nYeah, I don't see anything.\n\n48\n00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,900\nOh, here's the Teams meeting add-in for Microsoft.\n\n49\n00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,860\nNow, it has it as active.\n\n50\n00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:14,752\nOkay.\n\n51\n00:02:15,921 --> 00:02:25,870\nso it should be there but I think you might have to be trying to remember I think\n\n52\n00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,513\nyou have to be in a like a like maybe your calendar area yeah no no I'm there and\n\n53\n00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:32,997\nI'm trying to put it in and I clicked on it you know it comes up with you know um\n\n54\n00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,859\nyou know title and but when you look to the top.\n\n55\n00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,008\nIt's not lit.\n\n56\n00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,665\nLike I can't it won't allow me to bring it up.\n\n57\n00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,919\nThat wouldn't be a piece of recruiter though.\n\n58\n00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,513\nLike do you see it in your menu up at the top?\n\n59\n00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,512\nYeah, I see it but you know everything else is kind of lit.\n\n60\n00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,938\nEverything else is lit.\n\n61\n00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:12,083\nLike it's sign in is lit and invite attendees or is lit but this one's you know\n\n62\n00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:21,086\nit's dark it's not lit up and you still have the app installed no i don't really\n\n63\n00:03:21,086 --> 00:03:30,619\nuse teams and it's not a piece of cruder um issues so i'm trying to figure out um\n\n64\n00:03:30,619 --> 00:03:36,974\nso it's not lit up but you see it okay I definitely,\n\n65\n00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,034\nI mean,\n\n66\n00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:39,622\nI see it,\n\n67\n00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,800\nbut it just won't let me.\n\n68\n00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,520\nLet's see, why is it key?\n\n69\n00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,320\nSo it's there, it's just grayed out.\n\n70\n00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,340\nAnd it's disabled or not installed correctly.\n\n71\n00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,940\nTo fix this, you must enable add-ins and outlook options.\n\n72\n00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:07,386\nI'm sure Teams is",
