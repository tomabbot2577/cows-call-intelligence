    "text": "Hey, Raph, how's it going? How much? How are you? Oh, you know, just trying to get caught up. No. Whatever. Yeah, sorry. It wasn't anyone that I was super close to. It was one of my best friends. One of my best friends has a family castaway, so we just wanted to go to the viewing to be there. So it wasn't a super big loss for me, but I wanted to be there just to whatever for them. Yeah. What did I have at one of those last month? Was it five of them? Yeah, you had a bunch. Oh my god, my best friend. One of my best friends was one of her moms. She's still like she won't even talk on the phone. We text a lot. Yeah, we text a lot. She's like, I'm not allowed to talk to anybody still. I don't know what I'm going to do. she's horrified I know well she found her and they made her like on the phone like give her CPR she's like no she's dead like you're like yeah no so she's like really freaked out you know what I mean yeah no she's like yeah she's like what if I would have come down earlier or like she doesn't know was it like during the night or so I have no idea what had happened yeah um yeah so anyway um okay so Green's one of the ones that like don't hear from bill they put in cancellations requests they've got one open like a while back and i think it was just dropped like they never really formally canceled nobody ever followed up i'm at the point now because they are also a law firm i don't want to get in trouble with yeah why don't we just void the open let them go and move on um i'm totally fine with that what is the second number else or something in there so that way we have we have that I approved it I want to say there was two of them hold on one second do you know what the name of Green Spelder yeah typing Green Spelder is one word Green Spelder, Hemker, and Gale yeah there's 90243 and there's 91550 was two tickets you know yeah they've made it clear that they're looking to leave the last two years, it looks like. I'll just void this. Yeah, I'm good with that. I'm not super concerned about it. We should probably put in a new cancellation ticket, though, since this one's so old. I'll do this part. Do you want to create the ticket and say, we do have history that you were wanting to cancel. We voided your open invoice. We're going to shut down your debit. Is there a email about it or when did they request it? It's been kind of going back and forth, and we were trying to get Bill because we were saying, well, since you didn't formally tell us, because they left it like, oh, we want to just make sure our data transferred over. Then they never did. But there was also Jesse Fenton, too, at some point sometimes. So it's kind of been going on for a while. Oh, I see. I see what you're talking about. Okay. let me take a look they need to cancel our account but they renewed you said there's a different like their renewal wasn't right now but yeah so if anything we got more than we probably should have I agree I agree because if those tickets are from a year ago the fact that we got the fact that we got May, June, and July payments actually in August we got more than I think we should have okay here's this so should this go it's not Ashley anymore is it or no it is Ashley is it was Jesse sent me okay And that email was a Carter at blah blah blah. There we go. Alright, so this is a ASP cancellation. I don't care about that. I don't care about any of that. Yeah, Bill doesn't seem to make a priority. I mean, we can only ask him so many times. Like, I just didn't want to get in trouble with it, you know? Yeah. We need a better, like, system for it anyway. What used to happen is when somebody requested a cancellation, Liz would send an email or whoever would send an email into the cancellation email group, which would go to all the owners, me, James, and Liz. And then we would see the salesperson. It's obviously Lombardo now. And then we would determine, we would take a look at it, see what was happening. Um, either I or Bill would reach out depending on what the, or sorry, either I or Lombardo would reach out. We'd get that information and then we would say like, Hey, let's do like this for them. Like sometimes we'll like put them on hold for the remainder or they're going to move forward. And if nobody answered, like if there was no approval for it for like three days, I think Liz gave him, she would just process. She'd be like, I'm, I'm moving forward with this. like we can't just like leave these open for forever and ever so we need something similar to that i don't really know who technically would approve cancellations he's just like doing them and running them by him or asking him to reach out um but i agree with you um so yeah i'll put in the info for this and i have the billing side i have the recurring app deleted. I voided the open one. I have made the account inactive. Okay. Then I can go through and do that. Do you not ask for a date? She's been asking. They haven't needed it in a long time. Oh, okay. So we can just as soon as that backup is ready, right? No, I think they already did all that. They just want it done. the backup okay yeah okay as far as i know yeah they've already got their backups and everything okay then i'll just follow the cancellation what was their did they um yeah i think they moved to another system i think so too and it sounds like they're not even the people on the contract they're just looking for it to be done and over with and i think it was may or whatever was when they renewed, but like you said, we've gotten plenty out of them. They've been paying this whole time, haven't they? Yeah. They got a data backup a year ago. Which probably means they were supposed to have been canceled back in May. They didn't request a refund, so we just lost our hands on it, cut our losses, and not even because we got more than what we would have gotten from May to now. So when was their bill due? Or when was it going to be due? It was September 1st. Yeah, that's totally done. Yeah, we'll do whatever. Okay. Yeah, I will take care of that. I have this. I'm going to see you again. I have the cancellation ticket. I got all this stupid info in. So that should be good. Great. So you should be able to do all of that, I think. how is it uh and then you did send me an email i saw you responded my email this morning about um uh the divisha stuff what you said i think that's a great suggestion we can just do that you mark them resolved and then she can go in and do whatever yeah i'll do everything up until that whatever she's doing to manually track them um yeah yeah because then it and then that way she still they'll be handled yeah but at least she'll still be alerted when she gets back because i don't think it's no that stuff that stuff is not urgent and it doesn't matter because i have to update those reports anyway so it's not which i haven't done in like the last two weeks because whatever and i've been trying to um i need to i'm going to be gone from I'm working a little bit in the morning Thursday, but then I'm gone Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So I'm, uh, I'm trying to make sure that I'm caught up on my stuff. So that way I can just answer some, or not even, probably not even answer, but go through my emails while I'm gone just so I don't come back to 50 bajillion, but I'm not going to do any real, I'm not going to do any real work. Um, because there shouldn't be anything super urgent. Okay. And the other one, I don't even know what to do about this. Bernard's group. Every email I get, I'm getting even more and more confused like what we should do about him. I did turn on a billing to start next month because he would normally have been on the 12th until I figured it out. He never paid. He's never paid this entire time. So you know when people get a startup conversion, it's almost like that startup fee? Yeah. Okay. So usually they'll pay like half of it up front. Yeah. And then when it's done, they bill for the second half, and that's when they start billing. So that way if their conversion takes three months, they're not getting invoiced for it. Well, nobody created anything after all that was done. So for all that time, he's never been invoiced. So I have one set to start for next month. Actually, I think I want to bump that up. Let's wait. We should notify him because we need to know what he's... Because he has logged into the system. I've seen that. But he has no activities in there. Like, nothing. So I want to see what he's even doing with it. Either that or we've got to turn off the database because he hasn't paid us. No, 100%. And then, I don't know. And then what's about the one where, like, I don't know, he said something about, like, he never did a final whatever because the whole thing was confusing and stupid. And I'm annoyed with it because that should have been handled. Yeah, I just happened to come across it. I forget what I was doing. And I was like, wait a minute. It's a conversion. That was, like, all that they were doing. how are you mad on top of your like there weren't that many there just aren't that many conversions that stuff should be missed for that long that's like a really long time yeah so yep um so I'll go we'll figure that out I think that's probably something that someone needs to call and talk to him because we can't just like um well like obviously we can start going him but i like he owes us quite a bit of money and we need to figure out if he's going to be continuing to use the database or not really using it that much and what he wants to do from there like he did a whole training with onyx that was like hard and didn't really work out and then he did some training with me to try to get him in he's a super super difficult user because he came from like i don't even remember what it was called but it was something that was like basically the windows version of pcr 9 or pcr um and he just was like lost and we got him like in there and i gave him some processes to work through that worked for what he was looking for But his thing was basically, it was so, so, it was so whatever. Like one of those like old DAS-based systems or something like that? Like, yeah, like basically just like, and he was like, well, I just want to be able to have like a task list. And I just like keep pushing stuff out. And I'm like, oh, wait a minute. Oh, I think I had one of those kind of people. What is that software? Let's see if they have it converting from. I had something and the lady was just so freaking annoyed it's like well we don't do that. Was it wind search or something like that? That could be one of them it sounds like maybe um but yeah it was just he was like I was just so confused I'm like and then there was like no info I was trying to get info from Kane on like what the like uh like demo notes even were. Oh he was using a conversion from Bond. Never even heard of it. I had never heard of it. He showed it to me and I was like, this is like... I could do this. There was some lady that kept getting all pissed off because there wasn't activities like upcoming and all these things. No, we don't do that. You would just have a task list of all the dates and times and you would just go next to it and mark it completed or attempted. And then you would have like all your things that are still open from that person. Yeah. And like, there's not really a good, like, there are tasks in there that are like, whatever. But one, not set up very well. And two, like, it just doesn't really make sense. I mean, I do. I do agree, though, that we should be, that we should be, we do need some kind of like centralized something or other. probably on the dashboard, like my PCR screen when they log in for PCRM, because now you have tasks with, you have your interviews, you have your deals, you have your whatever. And you're calling it interviews. Yeah. I wouldn't stop. I mean, I say pipeline steps, but like- Yeah. That was the whole purpose of, like, I remember that meeting, you know, we're calling it pipeline because the word interviews confuses people. But then they left it in mixed around. So it's like. Yeah. Well, everything on the back end was like interview, interview type, interview this. Yeah, but anything that the customer sees, it can't be interviews. interviews. No, I agree. I agree. Unless it's a like pipeline step called interview, or you're scheduling the interview with an interviewer or whatever. I think you guys said they changed like the AI search. It was like, oh no, you got to use the word interview. And they're like, we are supposed to be going away from this. And you can do the good part about that though, is the call has like both pipeline step and interview in there so if they're using legacy it still requires interview but if they're using new pipeline you can ask for a specific pipeline step by name but like it's the whole thing is stupid and doesn't really make sense it also irritates me like i'm annoyed now because with pcrm like when you upgrade from old pipeline to new pipeline it is stupid dumb does not make sense. Like there's no good way to like do that. You can't really like in PCRM, you can't even see the legacy pipeline. So we need a way to Yeah, once it's gone, it's gone. Right, right. So I don't know. I was looking at, I did kind of, I did a bunch of whatever on this, but if my thought of what I think we should do, I think we should do this for all of the, all of the, like, upgrades, even if it's not right away, if we give them a little bit. But you can have, you can make legacy pipeline, you can make a legacy pipeline step show the placeholder on the new pipeline if you match the right info. And if we run some kind of SQL script to do some replacements with the, like, C range check. It is a lot of stuff. but like i just i just tell people the pipelines that you have are the positions that you have they'll keep that going forward which after a while won't be an issue as you start those drop jobs start dropping off and they go okay and i and i agree and that was the right thing to do then and it was fine in pcr9 because you could see both but now with pcrm you can't see the old one so you can only really go into like individual um you can only really go into individual like records and see their like stuff so that is not super over those like switching over yeah for those who switched over so there needs to be like i guess my thought process was we create they still do their you have their test and default database or their default pipeline anyway and then you go in you create a new one it's a great time for them to clean up that process because it's usually messed up but if you create a second pipeline template that is like legacy pipeline template that matches what they were doing before. We can like run a SQL script to update the stuff we need to. And then you open the new pipeline, it will show anybody that has the fee range text that matches that step. So like you can have it at least show them what steps they are in the pipeline. And then obviously to get the history anyway, they need to click on whatever, But, like, it would require work, but it would at least give us, like, we have to have a way. Like, Jason had one where Lombardo upgraded them, but they were on the legacy pipeline, and they had, like, a thousand different subfolders, which they don't need. Like, they can just whatever, you know. But at the end of the day, like, they just don't match super well together because the old typewriting was kind of janky the way that they had it set up. We let them, like, do too much with the out-of-process steps. You don't need 50 out-of-process steps. like put it wherever like make an activity put it in the notes do something else that indicates it because otherwise it's too much to like manage yeah some people are yeah that's when they get into like the micromanaging shit it's like oh boy like yeah there's not too many of those like yeah no there's not and that's like the part where i think the solution that i i'm going to propose would would work relatively well but it's just a matter of trying to like trying to figure out that entire process but we're trying really hard and i think especially with the changes that are coming up like they have the they have the roll-up list customization in like code review now so that's going to go out the import tool is almost done there's some stuff they need to do to it but it's it's better for sure and like there's just it's getting to a point where like it is manageable people are still gonna have to change like they're gonna have to change some of their processes but it's nothing that there's not as many like huge road blocks where it's like okay well we just can't use this at all because it's not gonna work um and they're kind of going into they're doing some cleanup now because we've been really like pushing out thing after thing after thing so james wants us to go into more like cleanup maintenance mode and not like let's push out all of these new features because like deals isn't even like done and ready to go like it's more or less unusable right now because of like where it's at um which is frustrating because that was released like six months ago so So I think it's just frustrating. But we'll get there. It's just like, I'm in charge of... It was working okay when we were in charge of stuff, but then Steve also... Like, when I was more involved, it was running better, but I was also working too much. And then Steve would come in and be like, and we need this and we need this and we need to release this in five days and i'm like dude like no you can't do that that's not how it works right he like said that on a call one time and we were like five days is insane that doesn't that's not real that's not a thing very few things are coming out in five days and nothing that requires like a developer to like first you gotta like spec it out So Amy has to create that. Then you have to go in and do a code review to see what's possible, what's not possible. Then Amy has to go back in and check it. Then the developer has to write it. It goes into design review. She makes sure everything's fine. Then it goes into code review to make sure there's no big issues. then it gets released into trunk then jake can go in and or whoever qa can go in and test it then it's good to go and then you can release it but if it's anything support related we need to make sure we get like at least a day if not more in new two and so we can make documentation for it she can't just pump this stuff out like right all right i got this call oh one other thing i was just going to ask you about uh we could talk we don't have to do it right now the other one the Eric Grossman Elgin big customer they're wanting a data return should I go ahead and do that for them I didn't hear back yeah yeah sorry I meant to tell you yes you can go back and do it we did push the they were they were the ones for the opt-out um fix for campaigns that's why I had I had Coverstone push that on Friday because I was like hey can we just get this out because it's not a huge change it's been tested like they've been asking for the tickets two months old and they're not the only people oh that's been going on people yeah we're like we were told Yeah, but it's clicked. It's not enough unsubscribed. We brought that up like, gosh, for a year or two ago. Well, the unsubscribed thing, that needs a complete rechange anyway. It should be a one-click opt-out, and it should be – you should not have to go to a separate screen to then decide what you want to opt out from. And you should be able to – Well, that's why they wanted that category. so that way people can be opted into some, opted out of others. But the main thing is that as soon as you click the opt-out link, at least for analytics, it's tracking not that you necessarily opted out or that you unsubscribed, it's that you clicked the unsubscribe link, which means as long as you clicked it like, hmm, but then don't hit confirm, you are still getting tracked as an opt-out. And now it doesn't do that. It only, when you click confirm, it does it to both now, yeah. So like you could still technically do a if link clicks and click that one, but it is not based on that anymore. Thank God. Yeah. And we've written it. Yeah. We're basically told, no, that's how it works. Okay. Stupid. That's bad design. Um, but okay. I'll let you go. If anything else comes up, let me know. Okay. Okay. We'll do. Thank you. No problem.
