    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, this is your favorite pay-in-the-ass customer, Rich. Oh, hey, Rich. Yeah, no problem. Garrett, I'm just thinking, because I'm kind of desperate, I'm talking about what if I remove PC Recruiter from my computer totally and treat it as a new, you know, and remove LinkedIn totally from my computer and start from scratch because I don't, something is there because it's on this and my laptop. So there's something either in Chrome, PC Recruiter, or LinkedIn. And I'm thinking, what if I just started from scratch? So, yeah, I saw your email earlier today. I'm not talking about PCR capture. I know we did that already. Yeah. So PCR itself isn't actually installed on your computer at all. There's nothing really to uninstall. It's just a website that you can visit to get to your database. No, but I mean, it's not, you know, like when I got a new when I got a new computer, I called you guys and you gave me a link, you know, so I can use it. Yeah. You know, that's what I mean in terms of I realize it's a web-based system, but I'm just thinking, let's say I reset everything. I go back like it's a brand new computer. Do you think that? Because I can't think of, if you guys can't think of anything, I can't think of what else could fix it. Yeah. Yeah. So even if it was a brand new computer, we would still just give you that same web link. So there wouldn't be anything to like reset on that. And same thing with LinkedIn. You would nothing to really to uninstall or anything. But I did. There is an update in the last hour or so. I was it looked like on my browser, I was still logged in under your LinkedIn. I hadn't visited LinkedIn since we last talked and got your credentials. And I was able to recreate the issue this time, which I never had been able to before on my own computer. So when I'm logged in under your LinkedIn profile on my computer, the little PCR button doesn't show up for me either, which is a new development that that hadn't been happening before. So it seems like it might be something related to your LinkedIn log in your account, because I immediately then went to my own account on LinkedIn and the PCR capture was working on my computer. So I feel like we've narrowed it down to something to do with your LinkedIn login and that account. So I did pass that information along to the tech team and seeing if that opens any doors or theories up of what we can do for more troubleshooting. But that definitely was a breakthrough because we weren't able to recreate that before on our computers. So randomly today we were able to. Oh, so I guess that's a good thing. Yeah, yeah. I don't know why. And it's funny because you did. I have a note here. You mentioned like one day it started working for you on LinkedIn in the morning and then it stopped working in the afternoon. So it seems so finicky, whatever this error is. But at least we did get an instance where I can recreate it on my computer signed into your LinkedIn account. So that's definitely in progress. It's in my settings there, I'm assuming. It could be. There could be a setting somewhere in LinkedIn on your LinkedIn profile or your LinkedIn account that's maybe blocking that. And, yeah, hopefully, since I mentioned that to the tech team, hopefully they'll know a place to look for that. But if you in the meantime, if you do have time, if you want to look through any of your account settings and LinkedIn and see if anything jumps out to you related to using third party apps, if there's something to turn on or off there. I don't know of anything offhand, but but maybe my tech team will have a better idea. What about like two step verification? Would that screw things up? I don't think so. No, yeah, we do have a lot of customers. Now that I think about it, they do have two-step verification turned on for their LinkedIn as well. That shouldn't hurt it at all. Yeah, I'm not sure exactly, though, what the setting might be. But at least we have a new place to start looking and investigating on our end. So I will definitely let you know as soon as I hear from the rest of the team. Is the LinkedIn recruiter version still working for you all right? It doesn't download properly. You know, it shows, but it doesn't do the proper downloading. Oh, really? I'm just wondering on an account on sign-in and security, you know, like it said, you know, Chrome on Windows 10 six days ago last access. It gives you the option to end it. Should I end all these? Do you think that would be a difference? Oh, is that you're in your LinkedIn settings right now? It lists the – here, let me try to find where you're looking at. So I'm logged in. Do you want to come in to see my PC? Yeah, we could do that. Oh, is this it? Sign in and security. Yeah. Two-step verification. Where are you signed in? Right, okay. Yeah, and it'll probably list my computer somewhere in there. I'm not sure. where, yeah, these various sessions here, looks like there's a handful. Yeah, that might be something to try if you want to end the sessions and then re-sign in just once on your device. That'll log me out too, which is totally fine. And if we do, if the tech team comes back and says, oh, cool, let me try to log in again, And we'll just give you a heads up that we're going to have some other parts. Well, I haven't changed my – it's still the same password and the same email hasn't changed. Okay. Gotcha. We'll give you a heads up anyway if we do have our tech team log in. Oh, and you know what? It probably will require us to get a two-factor code from you anyway. So we'll just shoot you a message if they require something like that. So you have permission, I'm just saying. Not a problem. Got it. Okay, awesome. Do you think any of these sessions would do it or do you think it's stupid? It's worth a try. I like that idea. Because you're signed in, it says to seven sessions. Maybe after so many it doesn't like the PCR extension. It's worth a shot. And then notifications. is there anything in notifications if you go to that menu do you see that could trip me up oh yeah let's see notifications um oh these are going to be i see these are notifications that get sent to you um it could possibly be through email or might just be the notifications area of linkedin i think those would be fine that wouldn't really affect anything advertising visibility visibility of LinkedIn activity. Yeah, nothing's jumping out there. Yeah, it's worth a shot, though, to do the ending of the sessions. I think that's a good one to try. I forgot where that was. Sign in and security. Yep. And then the option is called where you're signed in. You're signed into zero sessions, okay? Okay, and then, yeah, you can actually try that out now while we're still on the phone if you wanted to jump over to a LinkedIn profile. Damn, that didn't do it. Ah, okay. I'm refreshing, it still didn't do it. Okay. Okay. Well, at least I can mention it. PCR capture, the pin is blocked. Is it supposed to be blocked? Yeah, if it has a line through it, that means it's giving you an option to unpin it if you want to click on it. Oh, so that wouldn't have anything to do with my problem. No, yeah, that would just, if you want to see the PCR capture logo up at the top right, that's where you would pin or unpin that. Okay. Yeah, that didn't do it. Okay. All right. I'll make note of that, though, that we at least tried that. And then, yeah, I'll... If you were able to duplicate it on yours, that's a good sign. Yeah, definitely some progress in using that then. Yeah, I'll let you know what our tech team says once they investigate a little bit further. Thank you very much. Thanks so much. Have a great rest of your day. We'll talk soon. Thanks. Bye.",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:10,219\nHi, this is your favorite pay-in-the-ass customer, Rich.\n\n5\n00:00:11,983 --> 00:00:12,351\nOh, hey, Rich.\n\n6\n00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:13,383\nYeah, no problem.\n\n7\n00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:16,660\nGarrett,\n\n8\n00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,441\nI'm just thinking,\n\n9\n00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,603\nbecause I'm kind of desperate,\n\n10\n00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:23,105\nI'm talking about what if I remove PC Recruiter from my computer totally and treat\n\n11\n00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:24,006\nit as a new,\n\n12\n00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:24,467\nyou know,\n\n13\n00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:28,210\nand remove LinkedIn totally from my computer and start from scratch because I\n\n14\n00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,871\ndon't, something is there because it's on this and my laptop.\n\n15\n00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:43,527\nSo there's something either in Chrome, PC Recruiter, or LinkedIn.\n\n16\n00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,597\nAnd I'm thinking, what if I just started from scratch?\n\n17\n00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,330\nSo, yeah, I saw your email earlier today.\n\n18\n00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,613\nI'm not talking about PCR capture.\n\n19\n00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,816\nI know we did that already.\n\n20\n00:01:01,293 --> 00:01:01,379\nYeah.\n\n21\n00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:05,634\nSo PCR itself isn't actually installed on your computer at all.\n\n22\n00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:08,780\nThere's nothing really to uninstall.\n\n23\n00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,493\nIt's just a website that you can visit to get to your database.\n\n24\n00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:14,021\nNo,\n\n25\n00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:14,703\nbut I mean,\n\n26\n00:01:14,723 --> 00:01:14,884\nit's not,\n\n27\n00:01:14,904 --> 00:01:15,224\nyou know,\n\n28\n00:01:15,244 --> 00:01:17,610\nlike when I got a new when I got a new computer,\n\n29\n00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,555\nI called you guys and you gave me a link,\n\n30\n00:01:19,575 --> 00:01:19,896\nyou know,\n\n31\n00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:20,938\nso I can use it.\n\n32\n00:01:21,802 --> 00:01:21,903\nYeah.\n\n33\n00:01:23,281 --> 00:01:23,521\nYou know,\n\n34\n00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,886\nthat's what I mean in terms of I realize it's a web-based system,\n\n35\n00:01:25,906 --> 00:01:26,627\nbut I'm just thinking,\n\n36\n00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:27,429\nlet's say I reset everything.\n\n37\n00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,598\nI go back like it's a brand new computer.\n\n38\n00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:37,479\nDo you think that?\n\n39\n00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,024\nBecause I can't think of,\n\n40\n00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:40,832\nif you guys can't think of anything,\n\n41\n00:01:40,852 --> 00:01:42,639\nI can't think of what else could fix it.\n\n42\n00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:45,147\nYeah.\n\n43\n00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:45,820\nYeah.\n\n44\n00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,305\nSo even if it was a brand new computer,\n\n45\n00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:49,132\nwe would still just give you that same web link.\n\n46\n00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,718\nSo there wouldn't be anything to like reset on that.\n\n47\n00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,100\nAnd same thing with LinkedIn.\n\n48\n00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,096\nYou would nothing to really to uninstall or anything.\n\n49\n00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:02,983\nBut I did.\n\n50\n00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,773\nThere is an update in the last hour or so.\n\n51\n00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:12,795\nI was it looked like on my browser, I was still logged in under your LinkedIn.\n\n52\n00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:17,333\nI hadn't visited LinkedIn since we last talked and got your credentials.\n\n53\n00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:22,066\nAnd I was able to recreate the issue this time,\n\n54\n00:02:22,387 --> 00:02:24,453\nwhich I never had been able to before on my own computer.\n\n55\n00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,849\nSo when I'm logged in under your LinkedIn profile on my computer,\n\n56\n00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,952\nthe little PCR button doesn't show up for me either,\n\n57\n00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:37,256\nwhich is a new development that that hadn't been happening before.\n\n58\n00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,797\nSo it seems like it might be something related to your LinkedIn log in your\n\n59\n00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:47,554\naccount, because I immediately then went to my own account on LinkedIn and the PCR\n\n60\n00:02:47,554 --> 00:02:49,057\ncapture was working on my computer.\n\n61\n00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,593\nSo I feel like we've narrowed it down to something to do with your LinkedIn login\n\n62\n00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:00,214\nand that account.\n\n63\n00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,253\nSo I did pass that information along to the tech team and seeing if that opens any\n\n64\n00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,600\ndoors or theories up of what we can do for more troubleshooting.\n\n65\n00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,177\nBut that definitely was a breakthrough because we weren't able to recreate that\n\n66\n00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:18,880\nbefore on our computers.\n\n67\n00:03:19,201 --> 00:03:20,468\nSo randomly today we were able to.\n\n68\n00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,169\nOh, so I guess that's a good thing.\n\n69\n00:03:27",
