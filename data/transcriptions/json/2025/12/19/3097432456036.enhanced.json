I wanted to give you a quick call just following up with you to check in on your interest in PC Recruiter. I know we talked over the summer. You were thinking about moving ahead, and then everything had to be put on hold until after August. So I thought I would give you a quick call. We still have an outstanding contract here for you. I wanted to circle back and see if you had any interest in moving forward or if there was a new timeframe or anything at all. Give me a quick call. let me know. My direct line is 440-856-0314.
