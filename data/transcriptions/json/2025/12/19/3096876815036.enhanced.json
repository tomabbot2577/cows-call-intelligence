This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Okay, so if you're in the vault area, what you first have to do is turn off auto-pay. Then you can delete the stored card, but you would have to re-add it. It doesn't let you just kind of swap out any information on it, even if I try to do it, because it's like all the numbers and everything, they're masked for security. So if you first turn off auto pay, then in the vault area, then you can delete that card, but you'll have to re-add it and then turn it on for auto pay again. If you need any help with it, give me a call and I could do it with you over the phone or, you know, do it for you from my side. My number is 440-946-5214 and I'm at extension 5466. Thank you.",
