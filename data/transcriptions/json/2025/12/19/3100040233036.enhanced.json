    "text": "Hello? Hi. Hey, Robin. Good. How are you? This is your call. Someone called me like two minutes before that. I was just trying to finish up on that one. Just you, a meeting invite. Okay. And I should do this on my new computer. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, because you want this working on your new one. Right. Okay. Let's see. I don't know if it's going to work, but we're going to try it. Okay. That's the only thing I can do. What I'm thinking is if you're self-hosted, you kind of purchase the software. It doesn't really include updates. So every once in a while, you have to pay an upgrade fee. The last one I saw for your company is from 2022. So I'm wondering if your version of PC Recruiter itself is not current enough to be compatible with the newer one, at least for the login. So what I want to do... That actually makes sense because it looks like from my old emails that 2022 was when I last had to set this up again. Yeah, so what I'm thinking is if we had 5.1.3 before, we just had to track that version down. If we install it with this, then maybe, you know, we get it to work. If not, then maybe we, I mean, hopefully we get that to work. And if that works, we can even try installing 530 if you're already connected. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. I'm going to mute in the meeting because we don't need that. Okay. So here's what I'm going to have you do. I'm going to have you go to the share screen option. Right. Now, I am hoping this works. Copy link. Okay. But make sure you go to entire screen. Perfect. I did. Here's what I'm going to have you do. Down at the very bottom left of your computer, type in the word. The window? Yes. Oh. Yes. Yeah, that little window search option. Okay. Let's go to type in the word add. Let's see if we can. What is it? ADD. Okay. I'm going to see if we can find add or remove programs. Okay. Let's see more search results. Okay. Right there? Let's try that one. Nope, it's bringing up a search. Never mind. Okay, go out of there. Different versions of Windows have this listed different. Type in the word app, A-P-P. And then why, okay, let's go to apps up at the very top, I guess. Oh, there. Or under settings, maybe. Here's just a little bit different. Apps. Okay, let's go to Settings. Okay. Okay, go to Default Apps. Or actually, go down to Installed Apps. That's actually what I'm looking for. Okay, this should list all of the apps that are installed. Adobe, okay. Let's go down to, we might want to do a couple other things, too. So, okay, you don't even have Java, and you don't have PC Recruiter Launcher either. Okay, which I don't think is going to be related. Oh, okay. I have the portal, but not the launcher. Okay. Yeah, but I don't think it's going to be related because we had, I had somebody take your, because I don't even use Outlook anymore. I had somebody take your link in their Outlook and other self-hosted databases. We're pulling it up with a login button. but I think they were a little bit newer than your version. So let's do this first. Let's go ahead with SPCR portal. Go to those three vertical dots and we're going to uninstall that app. And you'll probably get a prompt. You wanted to make changes to this device. Yeah. And you'll hit yes. So we're going to get rid of that one. We're going to try the old one. Okay. Okay. Now, you will need Java and Launcher because things like opening attachments and stuff like that, that won't work until you have this. So let's go ahead and get that taken care of. So let's go out of that screen. Let's go to a new tab. And the first one, you're going to want to go to java.com. It's asking me, do I want to allow picture-in-picture automatically? Allow this one? Oh, do they not allow? Yeah, don't allow. Don't allow. Okay, what am I doing? Java? Java.com. And then hit enter. Okay, scroll down on this page a little bit. Here it says download Java for desktops. Click on that. Scroll down a little bit more. Download Java for desktops. Okay and then you're going to want to open and run that file. I was even thinking it was related to this possibly but I'm like no because I know our guys would have this stuff on their computer. So okay so you're going to hit install. I know but it says not for commercial use. Yeah this is something that you would need would need otherwise you won't be able to open any attachments Okay, hit close. Now what? Okay. Now let's go to your PCR login page, but don't actually log in. log in. Okay. It's okay that it's on edge, right? Yeah, at the very bottom left. Oh, God damn it. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Okay. I just, that was like an automatic reaction. I get it. I trust you. Sometimes I go on autopilot myself. Wait, what is it doing? Okay, there we go. Okay. Okay, see down at the very bottom left where it says Launch or Install Windows? Click where it says Windows. Hmm. Interesting. So you have to do this on like any computer that's confusing piece or crew. It's just because some of our windows sit outside or need to kind of talk to your computer to do something. This is what gets all that to work. Okay, let's click Open File. Okay. And then you'll see, okay, next. I accept the terms in the next. Typical. Okay, I think that's already clicked. Okay. And then install. Okay. Yeah, I feel like I've seen this before. And then finish. Okay. All right. Okay. now I will have you log in this time but go ahead so go ahead and hit login now this screen here says always allow click that checkbox okay and then click open that way you don't get that prompt every time okay then here it allow yeah that's just about the installer okay pretty much always get that okay so what that'll do is even if you went up to like the resume, the quick add and try to use the add resume option there, your resume parsing screen will open. Like if you want to add, like click add. This one? Is it this? Yeah. Oh, add name. Add name and then when you say parse from resume that screen will be able to open. So if you just want to like browse your desktop for a file, it pops up that window. Okay. Okay. So that's one thing. Okay. Close that, right? Yeah, close that. Let's open up your Outlook for a moment. See how it's opening two inboxes now? It was doing that before, and I didn't do that. Close one of them. Yeah. Let's go to one of them. Okay, I'm on one of them. Okay, so okay let's go to file and then go to options and then go to add-ins. Okay, I got the optimize for compatibility and we don't see it listed there. One notes, okay. Yeah see I disabled it earlier. Okay, that's where it says this. That That should be out of there, though. We disabled it. Go to COM add-ins. You're right. I don't know. Look where it says PCR Outlook and hit remove. Okay, but I need to not click these ones, right? Oh, let's see. Why is it even still showing? That's odd. Okay. So I remove it. Yeah. Right? Mm-hmm. Okay. And everything else was okay. Good. Yeah. And then I hit okay. All right. Hit okay. That was really weird how that was like listed. Let me check it again. Yeah, there we go. Okay. Yeah, that was just really odd because we did the, we went into, we removed it. from that I had to go in the installed apps. Can you go back to installed apps for me, though? Oh, how do I do that again? I think it's your gear icon down at the very bottom there. Yeah, okay, there we go. Okay, let's scroll down. Yeah, it's gone. It's the launcher. Okay, so now I've got, okay, that was great. Okay, let's exit out of here. Exit out of this screen? Yeah. Okay. And now let me find my Google Drive link. Copy link. okay I'm going to put this in the maybe go back to your meeting screen for a moment which will be in your browser I'm looking for I'm looking for chat with everyone okay all right we're gonna do this sending you I had to put it in my google drive so I just we to send it to you let's close outlook for a moment okay and it's probably good better to go like file exit that way you're doing like a full shutdown i don't know i already closed it okay i open it and do that again let's see yeah let's try if you go file exit otherwise it's still kind of running in the background okay okay okay now at bottom right of your meeting screen I sent you a link because somebody get sent me it like the application I'm hoping this is it let's see if this will do it click on that link for me download yeah try that just not like portal exe though is what he gave me it's like the almost the actual app okay let's see what happens here I'm hoping this is an installing that he gave me about the actual yet. Okay. Try that. I should do it? Okay. I'm hoping. Me too. I'm wondering if it's really an installer though. Okay, let's see. Let's open this up and see what happens. Yeah, it's giving me... Okay. There we go. Hit next. I accept Yeah, I'm like, I'm second-guessing myself. I'm like, I hope he understands what I mean and what I wanted. Okay, look in style. Not like the app itself, but the actual install file. All right. Okay, hit finish. Now, do you still have that link that ended with .txt that we wanted to use? Yes, but it's... It's not. I can probably scroll up and find it somewhere here. I mean it's in an email but you don't want me to have Outlook open I just opened it did you not want me to should I close it okay because I have it in computer issues somewhere okay now it's not listing okay you're in classic Outlook right let's go to file options okay Let's go to Add-ins. Okay. Go down to where it says Manage COM Add-ins. Switch that drop down from COM Add-ins to Disabled. Okay, click on that and then click Enable. and then close it it was um it was slowing down outlook so it automatically disabled itself the last time i had it open so i don't know it could be what if it's okay for me oh okay um i was gonna say what if because i have my other outlook open on my old computer right now what if it's confusing it my idea takes up another license it just takes up another license really okay yeah that's why you gotta be on the classic version anyway so let's go back to file options okay let's go back to add-ins where do we see it anywhere okay let's go to go inactive okay down at the bottom okay Check the, okay, there it is. Let's uncheck and recheck. And then hit okay. Okay, you want to check it again? Where's your, okay, let's go file exit. Why is this not even? Okay, let's go back into your Outlook. That's what we want. Okay, so you've got a customer ID. That's valid. Okay. It's still not showing me my primary. You don't have one yet because you have to add a connection. Okay. So when you go to add connection. Oh, yes. and then now you want to put in that TXT link. Oh, okay. I have to find. Yeah, let me see. I still look at it. I can look it up on my picture. Oh, yeah, tell me what to do. Exactly, so I don't do the wrong thing. I'm trying to find it. Oh, there's so much going on. Did I save it in? your ticket or just when I was chatting with them? Like, what do I do? We're looking for the one that your administrator got. Yeah, okay. There's so many. But damn it okay I have to well let me look in Outlook so can't do that so the old login that I had has the pcr.electronicsearch.com and then I think there was the, you're looking for the ESI underscore main underscore new dot txt part too, right? Yeah, I want that full link that we did. Yeah, okay. I'll find it. Okay. Okay. oh that's not right there okay that was the screen that's when he was trying that was that that was when he said he was trying that other link so they tried that one they tried that one here it is copy message link okay Okay. okay I'm going to put this into the chat area. Okay. So hover, copy that link. Just right-click and select copy. That way you don't grab any extra spaces. Okay. Hover on Outlook and go to that second window. Paste that URL there. Hit go. Yeah. Hit yes on these. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That's one of the things that 530 does. It fixes that. Just keep hitting yes or no. It doesn't even matter. And then type in my password. Yeah. And then hit okay. Mm-hmm. Would you like to sync the calendar? That's up to you. I don't want to. Okay, hit no. But I was told not to. Okay. Would you like to create... Activities. Yes, yes. Okay. Now, once you do that... Uh-huh. Hover back on that window, because I don't... Did we close it? Okay, hover back. Okay, go over there. See where it's... You'll want to put in your password and then hit remember. that way you don't have to put in your password every time. Right. Okay. And I'm wondering if your database just doesn't recognize those script errors because those errors are gone. You don't get those anymore. So let's hit save and close. Okay. That's impressive. This is looking good. Now this is the same thing we saw before, like about giving your Edge web viewer having permission to open the launcher. So you just want to check that box, say okay or open. And you're okay with 513 for now. Okay. Now, having said that, we do have 530. We could try it. You're already connected. But I don't know what would happen because I don't know with your database version. We could try it if you want. Well, my thinking is that I shouldn't since I have it working. however um what i what we could do is wait for you could let my it guy know and see what he wants me to do the one you know what i mean yeah i i don't know because i don't know what's changed really from when you last updated like your version of pcr might be like three four years old yeah yeah and i'm not sure exactly how it's apparently something has changed and it could be all those script errors, how we fixed all those. That could be one of the things. Now, if we are just updating where we're not having to go through all of that, it may not be a big deal. We almost really won't know unless we tried. Yeah. And I don't want to risk it, to be honest with you, without having some sort of... Yeah. Exactly. You're not sticking your calendar. You're not doing anything major anyway. You know, accessing a record and right-clicking, probably parsing a resume, your activities would still write with this version. I feel like the ones that are going to be a little bit more like when you're syncing calendars, like with recurring appointments and stuff like that. Right. Okay. It inhaled. Oh, my God. Perfect. Now, personally, I would rather you use, instead of inhale resumes, the parse resume. What's the difference? Okay. That screen I just showed you around the ad wizard, it pops up that window, so you're reviewing it before it's created. Oh, let's just see it. Oh, I see. So you can like, oh, I want to change their title. I want to put in their source. I want to pick what company they go into or what job. Okay. I prefer you use this one, to be honest. Yeah, okay. That makes sense because I always have to go back in and add my name as the source. Well, your name is going to go into the username field. So usually in source, you put something like LinkedIn or a referral. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah, okay. That's what I mean. Yeah, but what's nice about this is – But it isn't showing there. Yeah, because we just assume you. Oh, I see. Okay. Because you're creating it. But let's say like when you do parse resume, it basically goes through this and it's saved for you without getting this preview. So here, like let's say you had his company in your database and you want to put him into an existing company record. You just use that little picker to the right and search for a company that's in your database. If you have a job that you want to link them to, you click on that little picker to the right, and you pick up the job you want to link them to. That way it goes into that job pipeline. I'm going to add them to a roll-up. Yeah. But why isn't it showing any options right now when I click on these things? You should be clicking on it. It isn't doing that. I know it's frozen, actually. It's frozen. Okay, let's hover on your Outlook down at the bottom. Actually, see that Java window? Yeah, that's the one. Right-click. Let's see if it lets you close. Okay, let's do File, Exit on Outlook. Oh, over here. Okay. Yeah. and so that closed that window. It still didn't close that window. I'm going to have to check on yours. Oh, my God, that's just one of the, maybe one of those things where, okay, right-click just slightly over. Here? Yeah, go to Task Manager. And close that Java TM file. Like on that task. Okay. All right. Let's go back to Outlook again. Okay. That should restart that. I can't scroll down to like hang it to close that so that it doesn't because you're kind of zoomed in do you have like your mouse do you have like a wheel on your mouse yeah use that mouse wheel and like like to zoom out like press it down and I think scroll down and that should change your... It isn't doing anything. It's frozen again. No? Shoot. What happens if you go to file up at the top? File options. So many toolbar around selection. OK, go to Add-ins. Go down at the bottom. What if we tried disabling the OneNote? Do you use that? What is that? I don't know what you mean. It's like Post-it notes in your Outlook. If you don't know what it is, you're probably not using it in your Outlook. So if you could go down at the bottom, uncheck that one. Okay. Do you use Teams in your Outlook? Do I what? Do you use Teams in your Outlook? Yes. Like they add in with an Outlook or do you go directly to Teams? I usually go directly to Teams, but I get information about meetings and stuff in there. So this would be like if you schedule meetings at the top of your Outlook using Teams. I believe. That I would do. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I want this screen to go away. This is personal. Okay. Let's go to somebody's resume again. Let's try it again. I can't move around in the screen. It won't let me. Yeah. it will let me do click over here but it won't let me do anything it isn't showing up anything now let's see it does that let's exit again can I exit again? is it because it opened two of them? Okay, that works now. And then... What is the bottom right where it's got like the percentage? Like that new percentage? No, it's not going to change that screen. that's already been changed too I believe why is it doing that it's like selecting that picture instead of doing but if you press down on the wheel on your mouse is that what does it for me does that control anything no it doesn't do anything no I know I was having issues with this before on this computer. Right? I felt like I was getting something there. I'm going to hide this sharing thing. I'm going to drag the zoom slider. Oh. Do you have two monitors by any chance? I don't. Okay. Let's see what else. Why won't you do that? It's a stinker. Okay. Here, maybe I'm missing a thing. Okay. Click in the reading pane so that you know that you're there. Press and hold the control key on your keyboard. Then roll your mouse away from you, like using the little wheel on your mouse. There you go. I got it. Yeah, okay. Okay. Got to hold the control. Oh. Hit the do not move button. I know. And then die. Wait. Don't do that. Perfect. Okay. So control, and then I can make it bigger and smaller. Okay, perfect. Yeah. So give this a shot. Let's just see how it kind of goes. Again, with having an older version, I know we've definitely changed some things. I mean, I know it's been working. I just don't know how long I guess it'll work for. Right. Yeah. Okay. So should I tell the IT guys that we're good for right now? You're good for now. Okay. Yeah. I have a feeling it's that version of our current version of the portal just isn't compatible very well with the version that you have of PC Recruiter. Okay. Like the customers that are hosted on our servers, we could push updates. Right. But we don't have the – yeah. Yeah. And how much does it – do you know how much it costs to do an update? They would have to reach out to the account manager, Jim Lombardo. Okay. I'm not really sure what they're doing on those. There's definitely a lot more features that might be worth whoever's the main person having that conversation with him. Okay. Okay. Okay. All righty. Thank you, Robin. You are welcome. Have a good week. You too. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye. Thank you.",

00:00:03,812\nGood.\n\n5\n00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,476\nHow are you?\n\n6\n00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:05,939\nThis is your call.\n\n7\n00:00:06,402 --> 00:00:08,416\nSomeone called me like two minutes before that.\n\n8\n00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,013\nI was just trying to finish up on that one.\n\n9\n00:00:11,682 --> 00:00:12,728\nJust you, a meeting invite.\n\n10\n00:00:16,168 --> 00:00:16,351\nOkay.\n\n11\n00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,154\nAnd I should do this on my new computer.\n\n12\n00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:20,604\nYeah.\n\n13\n00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,145\nYeah.\n\n14\n00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:23,430\nOkay.\n\n15\n00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:25,940\nYeah, because you want this working on your new one.\n\n16\n00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:26,753\nRight.\n\n17\n00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:27,744\nOkay.\n\n18\n00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:29,198\nLet's see.\n\n19\n00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:31,680\nI don't know if it's going to work, but we're going to try it.\n\n20\n00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:32,557\nOkay.\n\n21\n00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,212\nThat's the only thing I can do.\n\n22\n00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:40,278\nWhat I'm thinking is if you're self-hosted, you kind of purchase the software.\n\n23\n00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,919\nIt doesn't really include updates.\n\n24\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,280\nSo every once in a while, you have to pay an upgrade fee.\n\n25\n00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:47,060\nThe last one I saw for your company is from 2022.\n\n26\n00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:54,853\nSo I'm wondering if your version of PC Recruiter itself is not current enough to be\n\n27\n00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:56,857\ncompatible with the newer one,\n\n28\n00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:57,799\nat least for the login.\n\n29\n00:00:58,723 --> 00:00:59,411\nSo what I want to do...\n\n30\n00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:06,813\nThat actually makes sense because it looks like from my old emails that 2022 was\n\n31\n00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:08,457\nwhen I last had to set this up again.\n\n32\n00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:10,402\nYeah,\n\n33\n00:01:10,422 --> 00:01:11,567\nso what I'm thinking is if we had 5.1.3 before,\n\n34\n00:01:11,587 --> 00:01:14,320\nwe just had to track that version down.\n\n35\n00:01:15,902 --> 00:01:17,952\nIf we install it with this, then maybe, you know, we get it to work.\n\n36\n00:01:20,222 --> 00:01:24,039\nIf not, then maybe we, I mean, hopefully we get that to work.\n\n37\n00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:27,250\nAnd if that works, we can even try installing 530 if you're already connected.\n\n38\n00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:30,446\nYeah.\n\n39\n00:01:31,794 --> 00:01:31,900\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:32,660\nHold on.\n\n41\n00:01:33,204 --> 00:01:33,658\nOkay.\n\n42\n00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:33,971\nThanks.\n\n43\n00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:34,796\nYeah.\n\n44\n00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,920\nI'm going to mute in the meeting because we don't need that.\n\n45\n00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,048\nOkay.\n\n46\n00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,779\nSo here's what I'm going to have you do.\n\n47\n00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,855\nI'm going to have you go to the share screen option.\n\n48\n00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:44,404\nRight.\n\n49\n00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,759\nNow, I am hoping this works.\n\n50\n00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:49,735\nCopy link.\n\n51\n00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,286\nOkay.\n\n52\n00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,358\nBut make sure you go to entire screen.\n\n53\n00:01:53,743 --> 00:01:53,892\nPerfect.\n\n54\n00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,314\nI did.\n\n55\n00:01:55,244 --> 00:01:56,400\nHere's what I'm going to have you do.\n\n56\n00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,368\nDown at the very bottom left of your computer, type in the word.\n\n57\n00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:02,938\nThe window?\n\n58\n00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,024\nYes.\n\n59\n00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:03,566\nOh.\n\n60\n00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:03,990\nYes.\n\n61\n00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:05,618\nYeah, that little window search option.\n\n62\n00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:06,574\nOkay.\n\n63\n00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,065\nLet's go to type in the word add.\n\n64\n00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,494\nLet's see if we can.\n\n65\n00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,114\nWhat is it?\n\n66\n00:02:14,707 --> 00:02:14,830\nADD.\n\n67\n00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:15,784\nOkay.\n\n68\n00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:18,280\nI'm going to see if we can find add or remove programs.\n\n69\n00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:19,487\nOkay.\n\n70\n00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:22,680\nLet's see more search results.\n\n71\n00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:22,973\nOkay.\n\n72\n00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,240\nRight there?\n\n73\n00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:23,938\nLet's try that one.\n\n74\n00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,700\nNope, it's bringing up a search.\n\n75\n00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,217\nNever mind.\n\n76\n00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,580\nOkay, go out of there.\n\n77\n00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:33,491\nDifferent versions of Windows have this listed different.\n\n78\n00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,654\nType in the word app, A-P-P.\n\n79\n00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:46,215\nAnd then why, okay, let's go to apps up at the very top, I guess.\n\n80\n00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:50,534\nOh, there.\n\n81\n00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,588\nOr under settings, maybe.\n\n82\n00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,300\nHere's just a little bit different.\n\n",
