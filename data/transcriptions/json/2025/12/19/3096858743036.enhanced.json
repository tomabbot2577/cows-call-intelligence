Garrett, I've retired, and I need to start winding down my business, including my PCR. What I'd like to do is to discontinue the PCR mail now, And then maybe at the end of October, discontinue my PCR subscription. Okay. I'll get you in contact with your account rep, Jim Lombardo. He'll be able to answer any questions and help you with the transition there, any contract changes. Let me see if he's available now. Maybe I can transfer you over to his phone. One second. OK. OK, he is looks like he's just stepping out of the office now. He's on his way out the door, but I will send you over to his voicemail and he'll be able to call you first thing in the morning and get everything set up for your kind of exit out of PDR. And he'll just get everything squared away for you that way. OK, great. So let me get you over to his voicemail. And his name's Jim. And yeah, he'll give you a call back tomorrow as soon as he's available. Yeah, I remember Jim from many years ago. Oh, awesome. OK, great. All right. Well, have a great rest of your day and look out for a call from us tomorrow. OK, thanks. Thanks.",
