    "text": "Hello? Hi, Paul. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hi, sir. Yeah, I tried to connect, and I guess you went in and got out, so I probably was a little late. I apologize for missing the meeting. No worries. No worries. Yeah, I logged in. I usually wait for 10 minutes because sometimes it takes time and everything, and then I didn't see you, so. Yeah. Anyway, no worries. I'm sorry for wasting your time on that. No, no. Is there anything we can do? I mean, are you still busy right now, or can we do something real quick, or you just want to reschedule? We can hop in right now if you want. Okay. We can even just stay on the phone here, and I'll just open up the meeting. I'll just start the meeting, and we can just – if you hop into the Zoom, we don't need to dial in or have speakers on. Yeah. I'll just show you around a bit here. All right. All right. Great. Okay, that should let me know when you're in. But, yeah, you want to look at the PCRM piece, the new product interface of PC Recruiter? Say again? I didn't hear the last part. So you want to look at the new PCRM, the new product interface? Yeah, yes, sir. Yes, sir. That's the one. Yeah, because I'm actually familiar with, you know, I told you I was using PCRNet, the actual one. Is it pretty much similar? It just has all that extra functionality in it? Well, if it is, we will. It looks different. So it is going to have almost all the functionality you see in your current PC recruiter and then some because it adds like a deals pipeline. It adds simpler sequencing, but it looks a little bit different. So we can take a look at kind of how that looks there once you're in. Hold on a second. And then, you know, yesterday you mentioned the prices, but you said like I think it was $100 and some dollars per seat for one year. And is that one year you pay the full year up front, or is it a monthly? Usually monthly, but you can pay the year up front. If you do that, we knock 5% off for an annual payment. so and i just have to you know i just have to you know commit to a year though yeah yeah or you can pay monthly and just kind of pay a month at a time that's no problem there okay and then you said the setup i think with 750 in 10 hours of training and it creates the database gets everything set up for you the trainer would walk you through everything in the system show you how to use this And there's going to be some newer features in it because where you're using PC Recruiter, you all don't have the premium package, which adds email campaigns and analytics and sequencing. So there are some additional things that you might see in here that you're not used to. And how much would everybody have to participate in that to get that functionality? I mean, it would have to be everybody in the group, right? Yeah, unfortunately. We couldn't activate that for one login. We couldn't activate it for just one login. No, because it changes a whole bunch of things within the system, a whole bunch of processes, some screens and stuff like that, so it can't be user by user. Yeah, it's got to be all or nothing. And how much is that per seat? If you were looking to upgrade where you are now, it would be an additional $20 per user per month over what you're paying now. Yeah, that's nothing. See, the biggest problem we're having right now, and this is just me personally, is anything I put in there, it's shared with everybody else. And we've always been trying to figure out how, you know, I wanted to be able to keep separate notes for the clients that I work with and, you know, specific things that I've actually got from them during a conversation, but there was really no way to do that. Has that changed at all? No, not unless you have separate databases. Some people will create separate databases, and then each user would work on their own database. then you can keep everything private. But other than that, if it's in one database, you can set it up so that certain fields are system admin view only, but that's very minimal. You really can't keep private things in the system very well. Okay. Anyway, I think I got a lot of information anyway. So now what am I doing right now? So I'm trying to get back into the thing, right? Yeah, get into the Zoom if you would. You should just be able to click the link. We don't need to dial in or anything like that. Just click the link and it will go to the screen share portion. Now, on one side, I was going to try to get connected via my computer, but I'm just going to go stay with the phone here. Whatever's best to look at it on the screen. Yeah. Because I don't have any video feed. I was just going to share my computer screen and show you around. All right. I'm connecting now. This is preparing the meeting. There, I see. Okay, I see that you're in there. All right. All right. So I'm going to share my screen here, kind of get right into it, take a look at the, let's see, here it is. Do you see my screen all right? Should be looking at a sign-in screen for PC Recruiter. Hello? Paul, do you hear me? Hello? I'm going to dial into that meeting. here.",

that should let me know when you're in.\n\n38\n00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,243\nBut,\n\n39\n00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:02,463\nyeah,\n\n40\n00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,190\nyou want to look at the PCRM piece,\n\n41\n00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,560\nthe new product interface of PC Recruiter?\n\n42\n00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:08,432\nSay again?\n\n43\n00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:09,820\nI didn't hear the last part.\n\n44\n00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:13,680\nSo you want to look at the new PCRM, the new product interface?\n\n45\n00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:14,340\nYeah, yes, sir.\n\n46\n00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:14,740\nYes, sir.\n\n47\n00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,210\nThat's the one.\n\n48\n00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:15,920\nYeah,\n\n49\n00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,767\nbecause I'm actually familiar with,\n\n50\n00:01:17,787 --> 00:01:18,189\nyou know,\n\n51\n00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:19,835\nI told you I was using PCRNet,\n\n52\n00:01:19,855 --> 00:01:20,477\nthe actual one.\n\n53\n00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,470\nIs it pretty much similar?\n\n54\n00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:25,640\nIt just has all that extra functionality in it?\n\n55\n00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,990\nWell, if it is, we will.\n\n56\n00:01:28,482 --> 00:01:29,049\nIt looks different.\n\n57\n00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,992\nSo it is going to have almost all the functionality you see in your current PC\n\n58\n00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:37,418\nrecruiter and then some because it adds like a deals pipeline.\n\n59\n00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:41,935\nIt adds simpler sequencing, but it looks a little bit different.\n\n60\n00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,788\nSo we can take a look at kind of how that looks there once you're in.\n\n61\n00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,209\nHold on a second.\n\n62\n00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:53,781\nAnd then,\n\n63\n00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:54,021\nyou know,\n\n64\n00:01:54,062 --> 00:01:55,504\nyesterday you mentioned the prices,\n\n65\n00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:59,853\nbut you said like I think it was $100 and some dollars per seat for one year.\n\n66\n00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,487\nAnd is that one year you pay the full year up front, or is it a monthly?\n\n67\n00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:14,017\nUsually monthly, but you can pay the year up front.\n\n68\n00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,118\nIf you do that, we knock 5% off for an annual payment.\n\n69\n00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,382\nso and i just have to you know i just have to you know commit to a year though yeah\n\n70\n00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:22,543\nyeah or you can pay monthly and just kind of pay a month at a time that's no\n\n71\n00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:25,925\nproblem there okay and then you said the setup i think with 750 in 10 hours of\n\n72\n00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:28,486\ntraining and it creates the database gets everything set up for you the trainer\n\n73\n00:02:28,546 --> 00:02:34,509\nwould walk you through everything in the system show you how to use this And\n\n74\n00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,731\nthere's going to be some newer features in it because where you're using PC\n\n75\n00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:41,633\nRecru",
