Okay, I'm sorry, and I couldn't quite catch that. What was your name? Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. Just a moment. Thank you. I'm sorry, she's away from her desk. Can I give you her voicemail? For sure. Thanks. Phone ringing. Phone ringing. Lori Hayes. Can't take your call now. You can leave a message after the tone. When you have finished, press the pound key or just hang up. Good afternoon, Lori. This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. just following up with you to touch base. You talked with Robin the other day, I think some time back, and about your PC Recruiter account. She wanted me to kind of check in with you. It looks like you're using quite an older version of PC Recruiter. So I thought I would give you a quick call and see if I might interest you in a demonstration to learn more about some of the new stuff we have, new features, functions. I think your signer has changed, everything like that. So would certainly be happy to show you around and kind of show you our email campaigns feature, some of our new stuff, and see if it might be of interest to you. Give me a quick call. I want to get a moment. Let me know if that may be something that you'd want to take a look at. I can be reached directly at 440-856-0314, 440-856-0314. And that is my direct bell. Thanks, Lori. Hope you're well and hope to talk soon. Bye-bye.",
