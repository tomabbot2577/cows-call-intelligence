    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Legendary Robin. How's life treating you? Oh, pretty good. How are you? I haven't talked to you in a bit. Is my headset on low? I'm going to turn it up. Yes, it's fine. There you are. Okay. No, it could have been mine. I might have had it, like, moved down just a little bit. I do that sometimes. So, PCRAI, match-enabled thingy-majigger. How do I get it? How do I set it up? So there's really not much for you to do. Like in that form on your PCR login page, like if you see where it is. It says here, how do I get it and put in my information? I just finally found that as you answered the phone, by the way. Yeah. Yeah, you fill that out. It makes a ticket. And then what we have to do is we'll have you, then they'll have you, whoever gets assigned to, like go ahead and put in now so you get assigned to. I just sent it. Okay, let me see. I would have created a ticket for you. I have to kind of organize it, streamline it. You guys got Tyler back. He left for a while there, and you got him back? Yeah. Good decision. Great guy. Oh, yes, absolutely. Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Tyler. Yeah, he took another job, and I guess, I don't know, for a reason he didn't want the other one. So glad it happened. Okay, so it assigned to Garrett. So pretty soon Garrett will be reaching out. to probably just like an email. What they have to do is they'll have you get to confirm which database name in case you have more than one or if you have more than one. And then basically we queue it up to have our server administrator re-index the database. It needs to be re-indexed to support this. Gotcha. And everybody on my team will have it when I get it. Yeah. It's not a per users. It's just it has to be enabled by like per database. Perfect. All right. Well, I've now started the wheel in motion. I'll let you get back to your life. It's wonderful talking to you as always. I hope you're doing great. Yeah. How are you doing? Pretty good? Yeah. It's recruiting slow right now. I'm not happy about that. But yeah, we just keep going one day at a time. Need more placements. More downloads here from last year. I bet you're hearing that a lot. I have kind of been hearing that a little bit more lately. Yeah. Right. Usually go a trend. Summer came to a crawl and then it usually picks up in the fall, but summer moved to just a, uh, uh, everybody was on vacation and then you wait for them to come back so we can make some decisions and then it's a pain in the butt. So, I mean, I got enough, I got enough recruiters. We should be able to pull some of this through. Yeah. It's kind of like, it's kind of like that with us too. So like new sales, trainings, it dies down in the summer. And then around this time of the year, it definitely picks back up. Hey, I tried my sales guy. Hold on one sec since I've got you. Where are you? Company, PCR. Jim Lombardo. Jim Lombardo is handling all sales now. Let's see. So I had Josh Francisco. Yeah, he's been gone. Yeah, he's been gone for a while. You can tell I call all the time. Yeah, Jim Lombardo has basically taken over all accounts now. All right. So he is the grand poobah in charge of everything? Well, for sales. He does all the account management stuff, like contract changes or new contracts. Is his wife's name Patsy or something? Yeah, she used to do our billing. Yeah, that's what I thought. Okay, cool. All right, so Jim Lombardo, J-I-M. Is he a part of the Lombardo family in San Francisco that owned the 49ers? I would think he would wish, but I don't think so. I'm sure he wishes, but no. Lombardo, does he have an extension and a phone number by chance? I'll put it all in the system. Yeah, if you call the main number, his extension is 5401. Perfect. 011. 5. What's the main? 4. Okay, so it's 440. Yep. 946-5214, and his extension is 5401. That's what I got. Perfect. I'll hit save, and perfect. All right. I will leave you to it. Thank you. All righty. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye. All righty. Bye. You too.",

Robin.\n\n4\n00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:08,440\nHow's life treating you?\n\n5\n00:00:09,526 --> 00:00:09,998\nOh, pretty good.\n\n6\n00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:10,577\nHow are you?\n\n7\n00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:12,359\nI haven't talked to you in a bit.\n\n8\n00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:13,740\nIs my headset on low?\n\n9\n00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,618\nI'm going to turn it up.\n\n10\n00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:16,199\nYes, it's fine.\n\n11\n00:00:17,206 --> 00:00:17,696\nThere you are.\n\n12\n00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:18,268\nOkay.\n\n13\n00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,140\nNo, it could have been mine.\n\n14\n00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,693\nI might have had it, like, moved down just a little bit.\n\n15\n00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,535\nI do that sometimes.\n\n16\n00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,828\nSo, PCRAI, match-enabled thingy-majigger.\n\n17\n00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:29,260\nHow do I get it?\n\n18\n00:00:29,362 --> 00:00:30,299\nHow do I set it up?\n\n19\n00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,299\nSo there's really not much for you to do.\n\n20\n00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,469\nLike in that form on your PCR login page, like if you see where it is.\n\n21\n00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,659\nIt says here, how do I get it and put in my information?\n\n22\n00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,300\nI just finally found that as you answered the phone, by the way.\n\n23\n00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:45,993\nYeah.\n\n24\n00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,278\nYeah, you fill that out.\n\n25\n00:00:47,541 --> 00:00:48,336\nIt makes a ticket.\n\n26\n00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,866\nAnd then what we have to do is we'll have you,\n\n27\n00:00:51,906 --> 00:00:52,668\nthen they'll have you,\n\n28\n00:00:52,688 --> 00:00:53,470\nwhoever gets assigned to,\n\n29\n00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:55,555\nlike go ahead and put in now so you get assigned to.\n\n30\n00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,512\nI just sent it.\n\n31\n00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,118\nOkay, let me see.\n\n32\n00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:02,000\nI would have created a ticket for you.\n\n33\n00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,076\nI have to kind of organize it, streamline it.\n\n34\n00:01:05,363 --> 00:01:07,077\nYou guys got Tyler back.\n\n35\n00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:09,577\nHe left for a while there, and you got him back?\n\n36\n00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:10,540\nYeah.\n\n37\n00:01:10,884 --> 00:01:11,439\nGood decision.\n\n38\n00:01:11,926 --> 00:01:12,156\nGreat guy.\n\n39\n00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,693\nOh, yes, absolutely.\n\n40\n00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:16,355\nYeah, I'm a huge fan of Tyler.\n\n41\n00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,202\nYeah,\n\n42\n00:01:17,242 --> 00:01:18,348\nhe took another job,\n\n43\n00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:19,152\nand I guess,\n\n44\n00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:19,674\nI don't know,\n\n45\n00:01:19,694 --> 00:01:20,820\nfor a reason he didn't want the other one.\n\n46\n00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,193\nSo glad it happened.\n\n47\n00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,178\nOkay, so it assigned to Garrett.\n\n48\n00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,871\nSo pretty soon Garrett will be reaching out.\n\n49\n00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:30,618\nto probably just like an email.\n\n50\n00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:36,533\nWhat they have to do is they'll have you get to confirm which database name in case\n\n51\n00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,399\nyou have more than one or if you have more than one.\n\n52\n00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,875\nAnd then basically we queue it up to have our server administrator re-index the\n\n53\n00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:45,095\ndatabase.\n\n54\n00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:48,698\nIt needs to be re-indexed to support this.\n\n55\n00:01:49,288 --> 00:01:49,616\nGotcha.\n\n56\n00:01:50,223 --> 00:01:52,013\nAnd everybody on my team will have it when I get it.\n\n57\n00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:53,444\nYeah.\n\n58\n00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,588\nIt's not a per users.\n\n59\n00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,217\nIt's just it has to be enabled by like per database.\n\n60\n00:01:59,260 --> 00:01:59,485\nPerfect.\n\n61\n00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:01,672\nAll right.\n\n62\n00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,916\nWell, I've now started the wheel in motion.\n\n63\n00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,879\nI'll let you get back to your life.\n\n64\n00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,615\nIt's wonderful talking to you as always.\n\n65\n00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,379\nI hope you're doing great.\n\n66\n00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:09,563\nYeah.\n\n67\n00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,280\nHow are you doing?\n\n68\n00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:11,860\nPretty good?\n\n69\n00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,084\nYeah.\n\n70\n00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,776\nIt's recruiting slow right now.\n\n71\n00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:16,440\nI'm not happy about that.\n\n72\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,608\nBut yeah, we just keep going one day at a time.\n\n73\n00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:23,317\nNeed more placements.\n\n74\n00:02:23,823 --> 00:02:25,319\nMore downloads here from last year.\n\n75\n00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,300\nI bet you're hearing that a lot.\n\n76\n00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,740\nI have kind of been hearing that a little bit more lately.\n\n77\n00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:30,900\nYeah.\n\n78\n00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,380\nRight.\n\n79\n00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,320\nUsually go a trend.\n\n80\n00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,809\nSummer cam",
