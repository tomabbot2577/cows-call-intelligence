    "text": "Tom Brown. Hey, Tom. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, good, Jim. Boy, it's been years since we've talked. How are you doing? It has. I'm very well. I'm very well. Good. I wanted to reach out and kind of see how I could help. Yeah. So I've retired from the business, and I've changed my email around, so I don't need the PCR mail anymore. and probably in a month I'll want to shut down PCR. I just wanted to talk with you and see how we go about doing that. For sure, for sure. So what I could do is I could put in a ticket to get that email taken off and that would drop it from $69.90 down to just $49.95 for the next payment. It goes through on the 3rd, so it'll go through a week from Friday. And that'll cover you for October. and then once you know the date you'd like to cancel, like if you want to cancel October 31, send me an email sometime early October saying, I need to cancel my account effective this date. And then I would put in a ticket to get the cancellation kind of handled, get that taken care of. Do you need a data return? Actually, do you want to take the data with you or no? Probably not. At first I was thinking of doing that and then I thought, Well, I could probably just download the phone numbers that I might need into an Excel spreadsheet, and that should probably suffice. Yeah, the data return wouldn't be something you could open to query a phone number or something. It's more if you needed to take the data into PC Recruiter or another software down the line. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so you would just export a roll-up list with emails, phone numbers, anything like that. So, yeah, what I can do is if you want, I'll put in the ticket today to drop the email, and then I will wait to hear from you with an email when you're ready to cancel and then when that happens, I'll put in the ticket to get that going. Okay, sounds good. Jim, what's your email address? It's jim, J-I-M, at mainsequence.net. Okay. Sounds great. All right. All right, thanks, Jim. Thank you, sir. We'll talk to you soon. All right, take care. Bye. Bye.",
