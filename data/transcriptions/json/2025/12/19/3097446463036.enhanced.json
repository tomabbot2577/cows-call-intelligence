Hi, Carrie. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call, just circling back with you concerning your PC Recruiter agreement. We got the signed agreement and the invoice was sent out last week sometime. I think they just resent it again since they hadn't seen that it was viewed or paid. So I thought I'd give you a quick call to make sure that you receive that, see if you were getting that paid or if you had any questions or maybe updated timeframes to get moving forward. Please give me a call. When you get the moment, let me know kind of how I can help or when to expect that or if you need me to send it again. My phone number is 440-856-0314, 440-856-0314. Thanks, Gary. Hope you're well and hope to talk soon.",
