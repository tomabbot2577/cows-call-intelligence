    "text": "Hello? Hey, I'm going through this file. And this deals in for Swan Group. You've got something here that says $850. And I don't know if that was a typo. Their upgrade invoice was only $250. Well, let me look. Swan Group. Which they paid. They increased $100 a month, too. So we take 100 a month times six months plus the setup. No, but they went monthly, though. Oh, that doesn't matter. That has no impact on it. Because if they pay annually, we don't get paid on – or no, we do get paid on that. But we get paid on six months of it. So that's 100 a month times six months plus 250. So their monthly invoice is 200. Okay. And then their upgrade was 250. Okay. But their old monthly used to be $100, and they went to $200 for a 100-a-month increase. So we added $100 a month, and then we multiplied that by six months, and then plus the $250. That's how $850 got arrived at. Oh, I don't know. So that's more commission stuff? Yeah, different commission stuff, like what we count. Even if it's a year deal, if they pay normally, we only get credit and paid on the first six months. Okay. Okay. So the increase was, so the per month column is the increase in per month. So then that times six plus the setup is how the 850 is set. Okay. So I don't really need to worry about the deals in column for what I'm doing. Yeah. Just make sure they paid and make sure, yeah, the deals in, because that's mixed up. That is usually six times the per month field plus the setup is the deals in column. Okay. All right. You can check the math if you want. and it's all cool. I think he just want to know, like, are they paying and stuff? okay. Yeah. All right. So this upgrade invoice was paid 519. Okay. All right. Already less paid invoice, less pain, 6, 1, 25. The next one is scheduled for, okay. All right. Okay. Thank you. Let me know if you're on anything else. Thanks Robin. And that stupid Zoom is what slowed down my computer so badly. That's what was slowing you. I'm glad you didn't use it. Yeah. And my son would say, like, you know, I need a new computer. I'm like, oh, I need it. I'm like, is that better up in the stairs? He's like, yeah. So I think it's just using Zoom down here. Could be. And then when he was at school, Wi-Fi. Yeah. And when he was at school, Wi-Fi, that's actually, it's more like his new apartment building. you're using like the complex Wi-Fi. I'm like, well, that's going to be slow. Once you get your own, you guys are in and you get your own service, you know, then that'll be better for you. But okay. For sure. That'll speed it right up. Yeah. So he was like, trying to get me to get a new computer for him. I'm like, I don't think that's it. It was worth a try. Not happening. Not happening. All righty. All right. Thank you. All right. Thanks. Bye. Bye-bye.",

Group.\n\n4\n00:00:13,224 --> 00:00:14,479\nYou've got something here that says $850.\n\n5\n00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:15,800\nAnd I don't know if that was a typo.\n\n6\n00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,391\nTheir upgrade invoice was only $250.\n\n7\n00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,198\nWell, let me look.\n\n8\n00:00:19,702 --> 00:00:19,925\nSwan Group.\n\n9\n00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:22,608\nWhich they paid.\n\n10\n00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,533\nThey increased $100 a month, too.\n\n11\n00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:32,111\nSo we take 100 a month times six months plus the setup.\n\n12\n00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:35,117\nNo, but they went monthly, though.\n\n13\n00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,600\nOh, that doesn't matter.\n\n14\n00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:38,755\nThat has no impact on it.\n\n15\n00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:42,115\nBecause if they pay annually, we don't get paid on – or no, we do get paid on that.\n\n16\n00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:45,740\nBut we get paid on six months of it.\n\n17\n00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,927\nSo that's 100 a month times six months plus 250.\n\n18\n00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,359\nSo their monthly invoice is 200.\n\n19\n00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:54,250\nOkay.\n\n20\n00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,413\nAnd then their upgrade was 250.\n\n21\n00:00:58,362 --> 00:00:58,545\nOkay.\n\n22\n00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,240\nBut their old monthly used to be $100,\n\n23\n00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:02,951\nand they went to $200 for a 100-a-month increase.\n\n24\n00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:07,604\nSo we added $100 a month,\n\n25\n00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,333\nand then we multiplied that by six months,\n\n26\n00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:11,959\nand then plus the\n\n27\n00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:14,079\nThat's how $850 got arrived at.\n\n28\n00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,676\nOh, I don't know.\n\n29\n00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,359\nSo that's more commission stuff?\n\n30\n00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,659\nYeah, different commission stuff, like what we count.\n\n31\n00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,464\nEven if it's a year deal,\n\n32\n00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:21,408\nif they pay normally,\n\n33\n00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,219\nwe only get credit and paid on the first six months.\n\n34\n00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:26,585\nOkay.\n\n35\n00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,291\nOkay.\n\n36\n00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,748\nSo the increase was, so the per month column is the increase in per month.\n\n37\n00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,174\nSo then that times six plus the setup is how the 850 is set.\n\n38\n00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,207\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,190\nSo I don't really need to worry about the deals in column for what I'm doing.\n\n40\n00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,080\nYeah.\n\n41\n00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,460\nJust make sure they paid and make sure, yeah, the deals in, because that's mixed up.\n\n42\n00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:53,720\nThat is usually six times the per month field plus the setup is the deals in column.\n\n43\n00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,500\nOkay.\n\n44\n00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,220\nAll right.\n\n45\n00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,600\nYou can check the math if you want.\n\n46\n00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,040\nand it's all cool.\n\n47\n00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,240\nI think he just want to know, like, are they paying and stuff?\n\n48\n00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:02,960\nokay.\n\n49\n00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,460\nYeah.\n\n50\n00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:03,880\nAll right.\n\n51\n00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,540\nSo this upgrade invoice was paid 519.\n\n52\n00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,140\nOkay.\n\n53\n00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,120\nAll right.\n\n54\n00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,040\nAlready less paid invoice, less pain, 6, 1, 25.\n\n55\n00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,180\nThe next one is scheduled for, okay.\n\n56\n00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:21,920\nAll right.\n\n57\n00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,000\nOkay.\n\n58\n00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,020\nThank you.\n\n59\n00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,560\nLet me know if you're on anything else.\n\n60\n00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,240\nThanks Robin.\n\n61\n00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,020\nAnd that stupid Zoom is what slowed down my computer so badly.\n\n62\n00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,680\nThat's what was slowing you.\n\n63\n00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,020\nI'm glad you didn't use it.\n\n64\n00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:33,700\nYeah.\n\n65\n00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:37,060\nAnd my son would say, like, you know, I need a new computer.\n\n66\n00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,780\nI'm like, oh, I need it.\n\n67\n00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,940\nI'm like, is that better up in the stairs?\n\n68\n00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,660\nHe's like, yeah.\n\n69\n00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,740\nSo I think it's just using Zoom down here.\n\n70\n00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,540\nCould be.\n\n71\n00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,500\nAnd then when he was at school, Wi-Fi.\n\n72\n00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:46,820\nYeah.\n\n73\n00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,470\nAnd when he was at school,\n\n74\n00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:49,895\nWi-Fi,\n\n75\n00:02:49,895 --> 00:02:50,745\nthat's actually,\n\n76\n00:02:50,745 --> 00:02:53,720\nit's more like his new apartment building.\n\n77\n00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,340\nyou're using like the complex Wi-Fi.\n\n78\n00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:",
