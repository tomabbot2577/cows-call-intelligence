I am well, Evelyn. How are you? Oh, good. Oh, good, Jim. So I sent you an email yesterday. Let's see if we can work this out. Certainly. Certainly. So, yes, let's help me, okay? because for me, you know, we have to follow a process internally, right? I've been back and forth with legal. I ask them to please help me out, to do this, to do that. You know, at the end of the day, it's been difficult because they usually don't do, you know, what you're requesting on your side, right? But at the end of the day, you know, I'm interested in the system, correct? so let's try to work this out together. Maybe when I reviewed the last corrections or the updates that they did, there were really more forms than, you know, there were not a lot of changes, right? So maybe we can work something together like a draft and just I present it to them to just give me the green light so we can satisfy both parties. Sure, sure. Yeah, I'll look through it and I'll see if there's any things that are like just maybe a change in name or I had a wrong address or something like that. And why don't I try and pull out kind of the bulk of the changes per se that I see, throw it in a Word doc and send that over for review. and I'll review and then I'll send it to my department because I just need them to say okay. Right? For sure. So I want to make it everything very simple so we can have your side and my side in compliance and happy. Yeah. My group just changed their procedure just because the cost got astronomical to have a legal team review everything. I completely understand. I had a conversation, look, this doesn't make sense. You know, it's a small agreement. You know, we have so many changes, right? Look, again, I represent the bank, but I understand how this works as well, right? So at the end of the day, let's try to make this happen. I'll have to make sure so we can put that. If you can help me putting that and maybe we can review together, that would be great. Sure. Let me kind of put together something that I can find and then we can touch base and maybe review that together before we send it over for your team to have a look. And then I'll let my team take a look as well. And that's perfect. That would be great. Thank you so much, Jim. Have a wonderful day. You as well. I will be in touch. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye now.",

--> 00:00:07,915\nIs this Jim Lombardo?\n\n5\n00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:09,056\nThis is.\n\n6\n00:00:09,987 --> 00:00:10,193\nHi, Jim.\n\n7\n00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:10,770\nHow are you?\n\n8\n00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:13,458\nThis is Evelyn Alonso calling you from Safra National Bank.\n\n9\n00:00:13,842 --> 00:00:14,638\nHow are you today?\n\n10\n00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:15,620\nI am well, Evelyn.\n\n11\n00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,417\nHow are you?\n\n12\n00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,116\nOh, good.\n\n13\n00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,950\nOh, good, Jim.\n\n14\n00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:20,680\nSo I sent you an email yesterday.\n\n15\n00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:22,116\nLet's see if we can work this out.\n\n16\n00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:23,656\nCertainly.\n\n17\n00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:24,240\nCertainly.\n\n18\n00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:26,127\nSo, yes, let's help me, okay?\n\n19\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,819\nbecause for me, you know, we have to follow a process internally, right?\n\n20\n00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:36,540\nI've been back and forth with legal.\n\n21\n00:00:36,821 --> 00:00:40,059\nI ask them to please help me out, to do this, to do that.\n\n22\n00:00:41,161 --> 00:00:41,341\nYou know,\n\n23\n00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:41,882\nat the end of the day,\n\n24\n00:00:41,902 --> 00:00:44,166\nit's been difficult because they usually don't do,\n\n25\n00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:44,386\nyou know,\n\n26\n00:00:44,426 --> 00:00:45,789\nwhat you're requesting on your side,\n\n27\n00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:45,989\nright?\n\n28\n00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,851\nBut at the end of the day, you know, I'm interested in the system, correct?\n\n29\n00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,328\nso let's try to work this out together.\n\n30\n00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,285\nMaybe when I reviewed the last corrections or the updates that they did,\n\n31\n00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:06,447\nthere were really more forms than,\n\n32\n00:01:06,607 --> 00:01:06,827\nyou know,\n\n33\n00:01:06,847 --> 00:01:08,069\nthere were not a lot of changes,\n\n34\n00:01:08,089 --> 00:01:08,229\nright?\n\n35\n00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,148\nSo maybe we can work something together like a draft and just I present it to them\n\n36\n00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:24,676\nto just give me the green light so we can satisfy both parties.\n\n37\n00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,358\nSure, sure.\n\n38\n00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:29,036\nYeah,\n\n39\n00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:34,394\nI'll look through it and I'll see if there's any things that are like just maybe a\n\n40\n00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:38,460\nchange in name or I had a wrong address or something like that.\n\n41\n00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,910\nAnd why don't I try and pull out kind of the bulk of the changes per se that I see,\n\n42\n00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,780\nthrow it in a Word doc and send that over for review.\n\n43\n00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,857\nand I'll review and then I'll send it to my department because I just need them to\n\n44\n00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:57,800\nsay okay.\n\n45\n00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,200\nRight?\n\n46\n00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,560\nFor sure.\n\n47\n00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,457\nSo I want to make it everything very simple so we can have your side and my side in\n\n48\n00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:08,540\ncompliance and happy.\n\n49\n00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,600\nYeah.\n\n50\n00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,904\nMy group just changed their procedure just because the cost got astronomical to\n\n51\n00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:15,780\nhave a legal team review everything.\n\n52\n00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,300\nI completely understand.\n\n53\n00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,840\nI had a conversation, look, this doesn't make sense.\n\n54\n00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,580\nYou know, it's a small agreement.\n\n55\n00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,800\nYou know, we have so many changes, right?\n\n56\n00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,620\nLook, again, I represent the bank, but I understand how this works as well, right?\n\n57\n00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720\nSo at the end of the day, let's try to make this happen.\n\n58\n00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,720\nI'll have to make sure so we can put that.\n\n59\n00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,052\nIf you can help me putting that and maybe we can review together,\n\n60\n00:02:44,052 --> 00:02:45,360\nthat would be great.\n\n61\n00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,280\nSure.\n\n62\n00:02:48,643 --> 00:02:54,104\nLet me kind of put together something that I can find and then we can touch base\n\n63\n00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:59,564\nand maybe review that together before we send it over for your team to have a look.\n\n64\n00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:03,246\nAnd then I'll let my team take a look as well.\n\n65\n00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,246\nAnd that's perfect.\n\n66\n00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,246\nThat would be great.\n\n67\n00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,246\nThank you so much, Jim.\n\n68\n00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:03,246\nHave a wonderful day.\n\n69\n00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,246\nYou as well.\n\n70\n00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,246\nI will be in touch.\n\n71\n00:03:02,604 --> 00:03:03,246\nThank you.\n\n72\n00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:03,246\nBye-bye.\n\n73\n00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:03,246\nOkay.\n\n74\n00:",
