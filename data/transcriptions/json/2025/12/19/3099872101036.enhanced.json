    "text": "Hello, this is Elizabeth. Can I help you? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received your voicemail. You had some questions around PCR and Outlook. Yeah, my question... I was about to do something, but I can wait. It's going to just clock me out. But what was my question? My old... I have both the new Outlook and the old Outlook, meaning not the new version. So my question was, PC Recruiter, as of this week, I can't even open it up on my old Outlook, let alone the new one. But I think that you or someone else told me that the new one, PC Recruiter is not, I can't use it on the platform. Right, yeah. So we're only... Just to do my thing. Yeah. Yes, the portal's only compatible with Outlook Classic, but we can get that back appearing for you there. It might be that it had a slow start time once, and Outlook will kind of disable the add-in, and I can show you where to check that. Let's see. Okay. So do you have Outlook Classic open right now? I do. Yes, I do. Perfect. So go to File in the main menu up at the top. Okay. And in yellow, do you have anything highlighted that says slow and disabled com add-ins? Hold on. Say that again because you cut out. What did you just say? I'm sorry. Oh, sorry. It might be highlighted in yellow there on the screen. It'll say slow and disabled com add-ins. Is that listed anywhere? It just says open, export, save as, save as Adobe, and then print. And then next to it, it'll say, oh, they're ad account, you mean? So it would be under Add Account, there should be things like Account Settings and Mailbox Settings. Oh, yeah, it has Account Settings. Below that, does it list anywhere slow and disabled COM add-ins? It just says Account Setting, Account Name, and Sync Settings, Server Settings, Change Profile, Manage Profile. Okay, so you clicked on the Account Settings button. So instead of clicking on that, just look a little bit lower. do you have what are the things listed below account settings do you have like mailbox settings below that rules and alerts below that and manage rules and alerts and tools and account settings account settings tools and manage rules and alerts okay nothing below so on if this was the issue that I thought it was right below manage rules and alerts would be an additional one that says manage com add-ins so that's not showing for you okay all right so let's jump on a screen share then and I'll investigate a little bit further here so if you just want to open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings ring central com oh I might have rings on already on my desktop let's see okay let me just call RingCentral. I do have RingCentral. Oh, good. I can give you a meeting ID if you want to join a video meeting. Okay, sure. Are you ready for that now? Okay, cool. That's 295. 295. 664. 695. Yep. And then 695 at the end. Perfect. Your microphone is unavailable. That's okay. Continue with that audio. And then I have to say join meeting somewhere, right? No. No, down at the bottom it will say share in blue, and then you can choose your entire screen up at the top. Entire screen at the top. Yeah, after you click on the blue share button. Oh, yeah, I can see that loading now. Excellent. There we go. I can see that. Whoops. Okay. So this is the screen. Okay, you're right. Yeah, it's missing the manage com add-ins. Okay, let's go to options at the bottom left. Okay. And I'm going to add-ins on the left panel, kind of towards the bottom in that pop-up window. Okay. and then at the bottom center click on where it says go a little go button okay all right and then scroll through that okay PCR underscore outlook is there that's good okay hit okay on oh there it is right here yes that was turned on yes that's good you can hit okay and then go to your main menu at the top you'll see PC computer listed there next to file and yeah open anything there okay I see what's happening it's the reading pain it's something changed in your view it looks like yeah everything's small the print is a lot smaller as far as each and every email and it didn't pick up my whole screen like it is now okay sure what I must have clicked by accident and no worries Even the font's so small that I have to wear glasses now. Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that might be all related. So let's take a look. How do we adjust? Try going to, at the top in the main menu, the View tab. And then, let's see, View Settings on the left. View Settings. View Settings? Yeah, right there. Let's see. And then let's see what's under other settings. Other settings, I did that too. And I tried to change the 8 to like a 12, and it wouldn't let me. Oh, okay. Grid solid. Okay, I guess hit cancel on that, then that might not be the best place to go. And you could hit cancel on that as well. Let's go back up to view in the main menu again. There might be something under view. I don't even have a Zoom button because I checked all this because I Googled it. I said, okay, let me see if I can do this on my own. And I wasn't able to. I didn't even have a Zoom little button. Oh, okay. To kind of adjust it. Let's see. Oh, there is, where it says layout there, there's something that says reading. Oh, reading panel, you mean? Yeah, if you click on that, what are some options under that? Write bottom-off options. Make items read when you view a reading panel. Wait five? I don't know. No, yeah, you can close that. That's fine. If you do open up an email, where does the email appear? Oh, it's a new tab each time. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Go ahead and close that pop-up. It might be, if we go back to view up at the top in the main menu and go back to reading panel in the drop-down there, go and select one of the options in that drop-down. So I think it was like right might be an option or bottom. We'll see that. Oh, that's how it was before. You did it. That's it. There it is. OK. That's how it pops up. And then my PC recruiter. OK, so then I must have touched something or it did it on its own. I don't remember ever touching. Yeah. Sometimes sometimes I think my my computer will adjust the view to if I'm if I'm typing on my keyboard and whoops, my cursor wasn't in a slot to start typing and I accidentally clicked on keyboard buttons that were like shortcuts to adjust my view. You know, something strange. That's happened to me a ton of times where certain keyboard shortcuts adjusts your view. So that might happen if you went to go type somewhere. Perfect. At least we're able to do that. So let me go to my other PC. This is a PC panel that I've been working on. So if I wanted to do a, since I got you on the phone, the AI is up here at the search, right? That's one of the AI features. Yeah. Let's see. So it's right here, right? Yeah, you just toggle that little toggle at the top of the box that says AI to turn it on. It's top left. If you click in the search bar again, that big box appears. Oh, I should turn it on. Yeah, and that'll give you some kind of guidance on how to build a search query. You start with like a show me, and then the entities are named, show me a name in names in this location or something. But I always start maybe with the suggestions just for practice. You can formulate questions that are similar to those. to try it out. And you just type all of these up in the search bar at the top, that quick search bar. Okay. The one that's above the little right here, right? Yeah, that's the one. So if you want to try things out, that's the best way to do that. Perfect. And it might be that we turned on the, I think we turned on the candidate match, which is the new AI that came out this week. Let's double check that you have that as well. it's in addition to the AI search. Where do I go to check that? Let's see go ahead and open up a position record so go to position in the main menu at the top. Oh right here. Yeah okay. Just open any one and then let's pick a position that you know has a job description. Do you have a job description filled out on it? Let me see, let me get to this one then. Does this have a job description? This one has a job description. Excellent. Okay, cool. So if you go to the action menu at the top right of the bottom frame, so that handful of icons at the top right of the bottom frame. Top right or side. A little bit lower. It starts with like a question mark icon, then a save button. Oh, this one right here? No, that's a little bit lower. It's a little bit lower. It's yeah, it's those set of icons there right where your cursor was. OK, right here. Yeah. Click on the three horizontal lines to the right of that to see your unpinned. This little guy? Yeah. Perfect. That'll give you more. And now you can see there's AI candidate match in there and you can even pin that if you want that icon up top. So you don't have to bother with the three horizontal lines. There we go. Is that it right there? This one? Yeah, that's it. Go ahead. You can just click on that. It'll run the AI candidate match and try to find candidates in your database that have resumes that line up to what your job description was. and it'll give you the 20 best options that it thinks it found in your database based on resumes and your job description and fields. And it does take a long time. It has to search through all your records and compare things. So definitely just keep that open, let it load. I just want to make sure it's working for you since we just installed it this week on your I'm hoping because you know you and I have had this conversation that when I do a search I'll get 2,500 applicants that have account manager as a title well you know the most qualified could be that 2,500 candidate and I'm going to the first say hundred you know what I mean so I miss out on those last ones that might be more qualified than the first hundred that I just reviewed. You know what I mean? Yeah, so this will help a lot. Yeah, it'll narrow down the best 20. So yes, so far you see across the top it kind of gave a, it put in that job summary and so that's been analyzed and now it's analyzing all the resumes in your database to compare against that. Okay. And we should see that loaded soon. the larger your database, sometimes the slower this will go. All right. So, yeah, what it's showing you now is it has all 20 of those selected with a little check mark at the bottom right. And you can deselect certain ones if you need to. But, yeah, this is what it came up with. It even has a score at the top right of each square that you can hover over, and it will give you a summary of why it gave it that score, the positives and the negatives. Yeah, so I love that feature too, the little analysis there. So usually what you would do from this screen is either put these names on their own roll-up list or actually link them to a position. At the bottom right, you have those two buttons if you wanted to add them to a roll-up or even link them to the position. Link to position. Where is that again? I'm sorry. Oh, right here at the bottom. About right. Yeah. So either of those would work. And if you put link to position, it puts it in the inbox. All those names are now in the inbox of the position record you had open the commercial account manager. How do I go back to it? So this is a new tab. So you can actually close this tab out up at the top and go back to your main PCR tab. Shoot, where is it? Oh, okay. There it is. So, yeah, if you wanted to look in the pipeline for commercial account manager, you should see those top 20 names were thrown in there into the. Let's see. They should be. I don't remember. Oh, yeah. I'm recognizing some of those names now, like a Debbie Gross, Holly Nelson. Those those came from your AI. Oh, perfect. Oh, cool. but they're not do that and I can undo how can I unpipe them because these are not people that I sent into this job is there oh that's um yeah you can remove them from the pipeline uh those were added when you click down the button that said link to pipeline yeah that's what put them into this job so if you want them out you could um you know select them uh here let me see this is the use that action drop down to the left of one of the names let's see what the options are like Tommy Wu for the applicant no sorry back on the back on the pipeline screen yeah you could go back there there it says like Tommy though next to his name on the left it says the word action oh there you go okay yeah I don't know which ones I did submit. I don't know which ones I already submit to the stuff because I did submit some people. And that's when I want to get back to because that's my record of knowing who I submitted to them. So I'm going to keep it as a roll up rather than going into a pipeline. I don't want to go into a pipeline because in my head, I submitted that person and I did not. And I don't want to confuse the two. Got it. So is there a way to undo that? There's not an undo button. Let me try this, though. I can pull up a snapshot of your database most of the time. I have this little tool here, and I can see what your database looked like yesterday. Most likely, hopefully, this works. And then I could just read off the list to you let you know which one. Actually all of these say today's date. If you should say recent they all say today's date but I know I sent my three or four resumes that have to go back to my emails and see my sent file to see which ones I attached and just the ones that I didn't. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, here let's see this this snapshot tool. Hopefully this works. It's slow loading right now, sorry. No, don't worry about it. Okay there, let me just log in. I'll log in as your admin user. That'll be fine. and then I want to take a look at a position it's called commercial account manager or AAM did I spell it wrong commercial okay maybe I'll search by the company instead of lion okay it was a lion a lion insurance services for a commercial account manager or a account manager a a m okay so yeah i think moving forward i'll just put it in a roll up so that i can separate the two otherwise i'll get confused and say oh i sent this person but i placed this person like for instance um elaine shy christy christian right out and melissa conowitz and tanya edgar although she's back on this in the picture and so is Chris Christopher right out or Christian right up um those are people I place right at other companies okay there we go I found the position let me go to the pipeline and see who's in there hopefully this is giving me an older view okay yeah so right now you're in the all folder on the left okay so all folder shows it just shows Tommy Vo actually is the only one listed as a 24-hour snapshot. It looks like all those extra ones there can get removed. Oh, probably. Yeah, you're probably right. I thought there was three that I sent, but that's okay. Probably is, but I'll just go back and I'll just take these out. So then if I select them all and go action, they'll just all remove? or no go to your top right the top right there of your bottom frame there's this action menu click the three horizontal lines and we want to and then just hit delete delete um oh that sounds like it might delete them from the database let me double check here do we copy compare i think it's just the action or i don't know i think it's just from this this pipeline but I'm not sure okay yeah I yeah I think that's safe and it would go in the I think as a safeguard it would go in the recycling bin I mean yeah I could just do a quick test in my database as well to make sure so I don't mess up anything I'm on something called the new pipeline most of the time and this is the legacy one so I'm not always familiar with how that works so if it go to this and I go to the delete you should want to delete this group of interviews yes okay good and that person should still be in my test database that I just hit yeah they're still there okay yeah you're safe you could hit delete I just wanted a double triple check to make sure those weren't being removed from your database. Awesome. So yeah, that's back in good shape. So yeah, feel free to use that AI candidate tool or candidate match tool as well as the AI search. And then if you have any questions... Oh, there's two separate ones. So there are two separate ones. The AI search and the match are two different ones. Yeah, exactly. Up there, you're looking at the AI search, But the match was when you pulled up a position record and went to the little icon in your action menu at the top right that said AI candidate match. Record and then candidate match. Okay. Sounds good. I think I got it. One's in the search. One's on position records. Awesome. Yeah. Let us know if more questions come up. Sounds fantastic. I appreciate your help. Thank you. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else. I'll close our ticket that we have open. Oh, it was just a voicemail ticket. I'll close that out. All right. Take care. Fantastic. Thank you. You too. Bye.",

Sequence Technology.\n\n4\n00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,299\nI received your voicemail.\n\n5\n00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:10,539\nYou had some questions around PCR and Outlook.\n\n6\n00:00:12,021 --> 00:00:13,015\nYeah, my question...\n\n7\n00:00:14,222 --> 00:00:16,517\nI was about to do something, but I can wait.\n\n8\n00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:18,212\nIt's going to just clock me out.\n\n9\n00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,069\nBut what was my question?\n\n10\n00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:22,232\nMy old...\n\n11\n00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,038\nI have both the new Outlook and the old Outlook, meaning not the new version.\n\n12\n00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,522\nSo my question was,\n\n13\n00:00:28,542 --> 00:00:28,842\nPC Recruiter,\n\n14\n00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:29,664\nas of this week,\n\n15\n00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:32,188\nI can't even open it up on my old Outlook,\n\n16\n00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:32,930\nlet alone the new one.\n\n17\n00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:42,530\nBut I think that you or someone else told me that the new one,\n\n18\n00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,533\nPC Recruiter is not,\n\n19\n00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:44,636\nI can't use it on the platform.\n\n20\n00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:47,792\nRight, yeah.\n\n21\n00:00:48,222 --> 00:00:48,800\nSo we're only...\n\n22\n00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:49,777\nJust to do my thing.\n\n23\n00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:50,826\nYeah.\n\n24\n00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,100\nYes,\n\n25\n00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,126\nthe portal's only compatible with Outlook Classic,\n\n26\n00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:55,790\nbut we can get that back appearing for you there.\n\n27\n00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:03,425\nIt might be that it had a slow start time once,\n\n28\n00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:05,509\nand Outlook will kind of disable the add-in,\n\n29\n00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:07,012\nand I can show you where to check that.\n\n30\n00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,888\nLet's see.\n\n31\n00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:13,831\nOkay.\n\n32\n00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,111\nSo do you have Outlook Classic open right now?\n\n33\n00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:17,726\nI do.\n\n34\n00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:18,655\nYes, I do.\n\n35\n00:01:19,525 --> 00:01:19,940\nPerfect.\n\n36\n00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,114\nSo go to File in the main menu up at the top.\n\n37\n00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:24,254\nOkay.\n\n38\n00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,263\nAnd in yellow,\n\n39\n00:01:25,283 --> 00:01:29,658\ndo you have anything highlighted that says slow and disabled com add-ins?\n\n40\n00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:31,705\nHold on.\n\n41\n00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,418\nSay that again because you cut out.\n\n42\n00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:34,200\nWhat did you just say?\n\n43\n00:01:34,326 --> 00:01:34,557\nI'm sorry.\n\n44\n00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,269\nOh, sorry.\n\n45\n00:01:35,822 --> 00:01:38,437\nIt might be highlighted in yellow there on the screen.\n\n46\n00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,430\nIt'll say slow and disabled com add-ins.\n\n47\n00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,360\nIs that listed anywhere?\n\n48\n00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:49,338\nIt just says open, export, save as, save as Adobe, and then print.\n\n49\n00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:53,360\nAnd then next to it, it'll say, oh, they're ad account, you mean?\n\n50\n00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,624\nSo it would be under Add Account,\n\n51\n00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,574\nthere should be things like Account Settings and Mailbox Settings.\n\n52\n00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,840\nOh, yeah, it has Account Settings.\n\n53\n00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,117\nBelow that, does it list anywhere slow and disabled COM add-ins?\n\n54\n00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,365\nIt just says Account Setting,\n\n55\n00:02:10,907 --> 00:02:11,368\nAccount Name,\n\n56\n00:02:11,408 -->
