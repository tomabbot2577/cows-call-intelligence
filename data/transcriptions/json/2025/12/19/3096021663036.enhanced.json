    "text": "Hey, Eric. Hey, go ahead. Good. I'm so happy you're calling because I'm signing off early today and I said, oh, no, I can't have this hold. So what can we do? So what is the issue you're having? You have certain databases that you cannot access. Is that correct? The finance, finance and accounting? And, okay, do you have contact with any of those admin users anymore? I don't even know who the admin users are, and their passwords aren't working. Oh, like the Ann, John, Megan for finance, for example. Never even heard their names. Oh, okay. And all these other people, none of them work for us anymore. I don't know who the admin is and the admin passwords don't work. Gotcha. Okay. Let me pull up and this is, I can send you a password reset form for the admin user. I just got to make sure that you're listed as the contact. This is for, no, this is not for MR Rockland County. This is for your other, let me find this here. Finance, finance and accounting and accounting. Okay. It's crazy because I'm even in these other, like in our past, like everything. The Shepard Finance one. Let me just, PTR. I'm just trying one thing, the admin password for Shepard Finance. Got it. So on Shepard Finance, no, it's the finance, the dashboard, the database that's finance. Yeah. Okay, so I don't even have usernames or passwords on any of those. Gotcha. Okay. So those are all listed in our database under Shepard Search Group Moraine. Let's see. The primary contact we have listed is, well, we have two or three. Let me check out those. So there's Harv Barron, Jacqueline Jardell, and David Ganshar. Yeah. I mean, I can – David, I have his signatory, right? So you can send it to me, or I can just have him sign it for both of those right now. But you have to sign it and send it to him and his AE. She's the one that will get it done today. Jane. Okay, perfect. Got it. Make sure I have his best email address for David. But also, I don't understand why I'm not the admin, but I'm not even going to get into that today. So we have his email address. Would David at ShepardSG.com still get it to him? Which one? We have his listed as David at ShepardSG.com. No, it should be DG at Moraine.com. Okay. And again, you have to also send it to his admin. Okay, and who's his admin? I mean, we're only allowed to have the password reset form signed by the contract signer, David. So I can only really... Okay, perfect. All right, so I'll send that over. For the... Oh, go ahead. You're going to have to send it to him. And my point is him and his AE. And she'll get him to sign it. Okay, yeah. What would be the best address there? JNUEVA at moraine.com. Perfect. Okay. And that is going to be password reset forms for finance, accounting, and there is one called finance and accounting as well. Does that sound right? That's correct. Okay. That's exactly right. And my question for you is, why can't you get me or how can you get me added to being the admin? Because I own the whole company, so this is why I don't know what I need to do. Oh, yeah. I'm not sure. When these databases were created, they had admin usernames added, but, yeah, I'm not sure. It's usually the team member who has admin access who creates other users. We don't usually create users for you on the database. So that's why the first suggestion was, oh, why don't we just have your admin users create users? But now I see that you don't that those people don't even have access or are not employees anymore. So our next line of defense then is just getting a password reset form for that admin username. and you can utilize that moving forward as your username or once you log in as admin you can create your own separate username as well for your database. I am the admin like the overall admin of the company I already had like I already paid for a transfer of these so because I'm going to have to wait it's going to take like time versus if I can do it versus David so is there a way you can maybe happy to email Gretchen. Like I paid for, I paid a few thousand dollars to have all the database information. So I actually want to do that reset on my own because I'm faster at this. Okay. Do you mind asking her if you can just let me resign? Yeah, that works. And David will be CC'd. He will be CC'd on it. That's totally fine. Like I'm not trying to strip anyone up. I just need to move faster with this. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. I will, Well, I'll have Jim Lombardo actually is able to readjust anything in your account on our end on who the primary contacts are. So I'll just talk to Jim Lombardo ASAP here and get that switched so we don't have to even go through David anymore. It sounds like. Right. And then can I. Are you going to send the forms then today so that I can sign them? Yeah. Yeah. So do you want me to just send to David and Jay now and then talk to him as soon as I talk to Jim for future password resets, we can get that sorted out? You want to just talk to him quickly and if it's going to take him time or something, then send it to them. But the thing is, I'm out then for two days and I need the team to be using it. And David is also out. So that's why the story. OK, cool. Yeah, I'll try to get a hold of Jim and see if I could get that switched. OK, sounds great. Thank you. Good plan. Talk to you soon. There's otherwise Jane just said to her and she can do it. OK, that sounds good. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",
