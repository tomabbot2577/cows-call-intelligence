    "text": "Thank you for calling Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. I am a current customer, and we use sequencing, and I'm having an issue with it. Okay. Is there somebody that could help me? Yes, that would be me. Okay. So we have, first of all, our company is Artis Rademacher and Associates. I'm Lori Rademacher we have been running sequences for quite some time now the first step in this sequence that we're having an issue with is a LinkedIn request and then a call and then a text and then an automatic email I put people into this sequence on Thursday and at that same time when I put them in, the whole list of people that I moved there, they skipped. I don't know how it happened. I don't know if they were moved. I don't know how to tell that, but they went directly to the automatic email and they all got an email and I don't know how that happened. I'll have to take a peek here. What is your username? Lori, L-O-R-E. Okay. And if you go under sequencing and click overview, what is the name of your sequence? Because I see you have quite a few. Yep, we do. That's why I called because I've never seen this happen before. It's TM general sequence. TM. Okay, I'm going to have to pause this to be able to see what's actually in this sequence. Because one thing that happens if you, let's say you made a change to your template and you have a sequence already activated, they're really independent of each other. So, yeah, your first step in this sequence is to send an automatic email. And then they go to the pipelines, I'm sorry, a LinkedIn step. okay but when I'm looking at it it says it's LinkedIn so are you in overview like go to overview which is your activated sequence yeah okay I'm in overview and then I have use as template or pause sequence okay so yeah go to just hit overview again because I actually paused it Okay. Because you have to pause the sequence. You can't go in and make changes as it's running. So I paused it to even view it. So next to TM general sequence, now that the sequence is paused, if you go to edit branches. Okay. Yeah, the first email is TM general outreach email one. Okay, can you tell me how, like, I don't know if you can or not, but can you tell me how that change was made? No, it's just what it was built on. Now, if you made changes, let me go to templates. What template did you use? Looks like general sequence. Let's see. Yeah. Okay. So it looks like either, and I really don't have a way to tell which happened. So when you start it, when you make a template, if you activate a sequence, if you go in and change the template, it doesn't have any effect on the sequence that's already activated. Like you could even delete the template. So it could be that it was originally created with that first email as the first step and activated, but then they went into the template. That's going to probably be my guess. And then they took that step out. Okay. All right, but you can't tell me who did that. No, it would have to be. Now there's no tracking as far as who made that change. Okay. Okay. The sequence that's activated, that one had that. Now, if you didn't want it to continue at all anymore, you could just really, now that the sequence is paused, you can end it and then just redo the sequence starting from the template, making sure the template has what you want. Like you could actually go in, let's say you could keep a template as is. You can actually go into a sequence and add another step at the end, but it wouldn't change your template. Okay. They're used as a starting point, but they don't like stay in sync, I guess is a good way to put it. Okay. All righty. Thank you for your help. You are welcome. Sorry I don't have better information for you, but yeah, the one that was activated, that one did have that first step. Okay. Now, if you want it back on, you'll have to go under overview and use that little slider to make it active again. Okay. All righty. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",

then an automatic email I put people into this\n\n13\n00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,970\nsequence on Thursday and at that same time when I put them in,\n\n14\n00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,891\nthe whole list of people that I moved there,\n\n15\n00:00:51,911 --> 00:00:52,211\nthey skipped.\n\n16\n00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,118\nI don't know how it happened.\n\n17\n00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:12,559\nI don't know if they were moved.\n\n18\n00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,643\nI don't know how to tell that,\n\n19\n00:01:14,663 --> 00:01:20,314\nbut they went directly to the automatic email and they all got an email and I don't\n\n20\n00:01:20,334 --> 00:01:20,935\nknow how that happened.\n\n21\n00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,238\nI'll have to take a peek here.\n\n22\n00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,295\nWhat is your

overview,\n\n26\n00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:37,436\nwhat is the name of your sequence?\n\n27\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,100\nBecause I see you have quite a few.\n\n28\n00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:41,369\nYep,

00:01:53,840\nTM.\n\n32\n00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,480\nOkay,\n\n33\n00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,310\nI'm going to have to pause this to be able to see what's actually in this sequence.\n\n34\n00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:05,267\nBecause one thing that happens if you,\n\n35\n00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:07,894\nlet's say you made a change to your template and you have a sequence already\n\n36\n00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:10,160\nactivated, they're really independent of each other.\n\n37\n00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:16,398\nSo, yeah, your first step in this sequence is to send an automatic email.\n\n38\n00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:19,630\nAnd then they go to the pipelines, I'm sorry, a LinkedIn step.\n\n39\n00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:25,153\nokay but when I'm looking at it it says it's LinkedIn so are you in overview like\n\n40\n00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:28,529\ngo to overview which is your activated sequence yeah okay I'm in overview and then\n\n41\n00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:35,689\nI have use as template or pause sequence okay so yeah go to just hit overview again\n\n42\n00:02:35,732 --> 00:02:37,280\nbecause I actually paused it Okay.\n\n43\n00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,020\nBecause you have to pause the sequence.\n\n44\n00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,180\nYou can't go in and make changes as it's running.\n\n45\n00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,260\nSo I paused it to even view it.\n\n46\n00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,547\nSo next to TM general sequence,\n\n47\n00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,293\nnow that the sequence is paused,\n\n48\n00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:06,040\nif you go to edit branches.\n\n49\n00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,480\nOkay.\n\n50\n00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,380\nYeah, the first email is TM general outreach email one.\n\n51\n00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,775\nOkay,\n\n52\n00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:20,251\ncan you tell me how,\n\n53\n00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:20,546\nlike,\n\n54\n00:03:20,546 --> 00:03:22,908\nI don't know if you can or not,\n\n55\n00:03:22,908 --> 00:03:25,860\nbut can you tell me how that change was made?\n\n56\n00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:30,220\nNo, it's just what it was built on.\n\n57\n00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,780\nNow, if you made changes, let me go to templates.\n\n58\n00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,000\nWhat template did you use?\n\n59\n00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,260\nLooks like general sequence.\n\n60\n00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,000\nLet's see.\n\n61\n00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,640\nYeah.\n\n62\n00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,320\nOkay.\n\n63\n00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:53,520\nSo it looks like either, and I really don't have a way to tell which happened.\n\n64\n00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,452\nSo when you start it,\n\n65\n00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:56,864\nwhen you make a template,\n\n66\n00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,275\nif you activate a sequence,\n\n67\n00:03:58,275 --> 00:04:00,534\nif you go in and change the template,\n\n68\n00:04:00,534 --> 00:04:03,640\nit doesn't have any effect on the sequence that's already activated.\n\n69\n00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,820\nLike you cou",
