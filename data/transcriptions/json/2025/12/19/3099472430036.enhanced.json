I will return the call as soon as possible. Thank you. Good afternoon, Rick. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just circling back with you to follow up and check in. Since we spoke earlier this month about PC Recruiter software, I had quoted you some pricing. I just wanted to see if that was of any interest to you, if you were thinking about moving forward and getting set up on a PC Recruiter database or not. Please give me a call. Let me know either way. If you do have any further questions, any interest at this time, or maybe there's a better time in the future, I should follow up. Give me a quick call and let me know. My direct is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks, Rick. Hope you're well. Hope to talk soon.",
