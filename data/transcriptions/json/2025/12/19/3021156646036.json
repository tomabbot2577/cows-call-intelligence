    "text": "This call may be recorded for quality assurance. Classic Chevy service, this is Travis. I'm going to help you. Hey Travis, this is Jim Lombardo. I had a question for you. I was going to stop out and pick up my key to my locked wheel hubs tomorrow. And what times are you open tomorrow? We'll be here from 645 to 3 o'clock. Okay. And my other question is, might you, while I'm going to be there anyway, be able to look at my tailgate? I am having the top portion of the tailgate is randomly unlocking itself. Usually if I even open the door, it just unlocks. It's happening off and on, randomly. I'll be honest with you, I won't be here tomorrow. Brooke will be. When you stop in, I would just ask her, see if they've got any time. They do have a pretty booked schedule. I would say that should be fine. I don't see an issue with that. And even if it's something that she says, oh, we have no time now, maybe we'll pick something later in the week and we can run it out there. It's just that top piece, the top part of the top latch, I guess. It started, if I click them both, it doesn't... Honestly, I'd be honest with you, it's most likely the button. And even if you had it replaced, I would even tell you it's probably most likely the button. Okay. They seem to have a lot of problems with them, but... Okay. I will stop over some time. I mean, if you wanted just to throw a button at it, too, that's up to you. I mean, I can check to see if we have one in stock for you. Okay. How much do they run? How long does it take? It usually takes about an hour just because they've got to take that back half of the tailgate off. Let's see here. What's a good phone number for you, sir, the one you called me off of here? No, actually it will be 440-339-9107. And this is on the Sierra, correct? Yes. Let's see if I can find this. You know, honestly, this might have to be something I might have to send you over to Parts for. It's not showing in my service parts guarantee little catalog I have here. It's not showing we have one. But, you know, we might have one in stock. And, honestly, Mr. Lombardo, I would really recommend having them diagnose it just in case, you know, something maybe in like the tailgate harness is going bad, you know, just so you're not putting a button on it, wasting your money. But, you know, I would just come up, talk to Brooks, see if she, if maybe she's got time, you know, maybe she will, maybe she won't. But like I said, we're pretty booked up tomorrow, but a lot of times people cancel too. So you never know. Okay. I will stop it. We'll take it from there. All right, buddy. I appreciate your time. Awesome. Thank you, sir. Take care. Thanks. Yep. Bye-bye.",

00:01:00,937\nIt's happening off and on, randomly.\n\n17\n00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,395\nI'll be honest with you, I won't be here tomorrow.\n\n18\n00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:04,716\nBrooke will be.\n\n19\n00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:08,840\nWhen you stop in, I would just ask her, see if they've got any time.\n\n20\n00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,953\nThey do have a pretty booked schedule.\n\n21\n00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:14,339\nI would say that should be fine.\n\n22\n00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,800\nI don't see an issue with that.\n\n23\n00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,409\nAnd even if it's something that she says,\n\n24\n00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:18,469\noh,\n\n25\n00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,011\nwe have no time now,\n\n26\n00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:21,220\nmaybe we'll pick something later in the week and we can run it out there.\n\n27\n00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,111\nIt's just that top piece, the top part of the top latch, I guess.\n\n28\n00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,579\nIt started, if I click them both, it doesn't...\n\n29\n00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,674\nHonestly, I'd be honest with you, it's most likely the button.\n\n30\n00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,487\nAnd even if you had it replaced,\n\n31\n00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,219\nI would even tell you it's probably most likely the button.\n\n32\n00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,400\nOkay.\n\n33\n00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,140\nThey seem to have a lot of problems with them, but...\n\n34\n00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,460\nOkay.\n\n35\n00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,840\nI will stop over some time.\n\n36\n00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,580\nI mean, if you wanted just to throw a button at it, too, that's up to you.\n\n37\n00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,660\nI mean, I can check to see if we have one in stock for you.\n\n38\n00:01:52,660 -->

about an hour just because they've got to take that back half of\n\n42\n00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:00,700\nthe tailgate off.\n\n43\n00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,880\nLet's see here.\n\n44\n00:02:02,240 -->
