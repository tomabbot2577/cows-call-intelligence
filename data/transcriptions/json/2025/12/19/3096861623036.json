    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Deb Oaks from Wallbridge. How are you today? I'm good. How are you doing, Deb? Not too bad, but I'm a little confused. What's that? So it could be that it was me, user error. I don't know. I went to do a global change to add a keyword phrase to 68 candidates, But now this is down to 65 because I was manually changing and I'm like, wait a minute. Maybe I did something wrong. That's why it's happened. So when I looked at it, when it said that I wanted to put a phrase, it said to put it in quotes. Was this supposed to be a single quote or a double quote? Are you doing bulk add keywords or are you doing? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, the bulk add keyword. It should be double quotes. Only if you're doing a straight up. It should be double quotes. So that's probably why when I'm looking at them, I'm seeing a single quote around them because I use the single quote. Yeah. Only if you're doing a phrase. If you're just doing one word, you don't need to do it. Only if it's a phrase. Yeah, I was doing a phrase. So it should have been double quotes. Yeah. So you'll want to do that again. Okay. But this time, I'll make sure I put the single quotes there and tell it to remove those and then add back in using double quotes. I wonder if you'll be able to do that. though. Let me think about that. Let me go to one of my databases I don't use very often and try something. I don't know if that'll be ignored, to be honest. I'm having some difficulty hearing you. Okay. So let's say I want to add project manager to these people. No, usually it says use a single quote. So I use single quotes. Now when I go and I look, I see the single quote and my phrase and then a single quote again on their record. I'm going, wait a minute. Okay, bulk add keyword, two names, only this list. Add. Okay, let me first try it the way you did it, but just a single quote. Let's see what happens. I think if you don't do it that way, I think you're going to have a problem searching, which would be my concern. So that's why I want to make sure. Keywords, keywords. I don't have that pen. Just put the pen back. Okay. You can remove from single quotes. And then if I go bulkhead keyword project manager. So do I have to put the actual quote things in inside a double quote to remove it? No, I did not have to. So it removes the quote marks too? I did not have to do that. so just as you put it in because when you do double quotes it doesn't actually add it it just lets it know this should be treated as a phrase um but but single quote is adding it okay yeah so to remove it just do it exactly as you put it in because that's going to clear it out where it's got single quote whatever you put in single quote but when you add it back in I'll just go back in. That's his name. So this will add. And then I'll put it in, but use double quotes instead of single quotes. Right. Because you use single quotes, it will actually put that text in there. You don't want that actual character. Yeah, and that's what happened. I'm like, maybe I did something wrong. I'm going to call before I know when to start manually fixing all this. Yeah, and I've noticed when people, when they even, like, let's say if you went to a record, if you even typed, for example, project manager within quotes, like within the double quotes, if you do that, it actually isn't searchable. So you just want to make sure. It's only when you're adding it this way that you're doing that. Okay, yeah, okay, I got it. Everything looks right now. Thank goodness. I'm sorry, I have to be an idiot here. Okay, so remember, quotes is double quotes. Got it. Yeah, double quotes for that. All right, well, have a great week. All right, thank you very much. You too. You are welcome. Bye. Okay, bye-bye.",

00:00:08,979\nHow are you doing, Deb?\n\n8\n00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:11,952\nNot too bad, but I'm a little confused.\n\n9\n00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,072\nWhat's that?\n\n10\n00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,950\nSo it could be that it was me, user error.\n\n11\n00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:17,935\nI don't know.\n\n12\n00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,785\nI went to do a global change to add a keyword phrase to 68 candidates,\n\n13\n00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,511\nBut now this is down to 65 because I was manually changing and I'm like,\n\n14\n00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:26,132\nwait a minute.\n\n15\n00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:31,800\nMaybe I did something wrong.\n\n16\n00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,660\nThat's why it's happened.\n\n17\n00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,109\nSo when I looked at it,\n\n18\n00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:36,656\nwhen it said that I wanted to put a phrase,\n\n19\n00:00:36,696 --> 00:00:37,420\nit said to put it in quotes.\n\n20\n00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,533\nWas this supposed to be a single quote or a double quote?\n\n21\n00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,297\nAre you doing bulk add keywords or are you doing?\n\n22\n00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:45,520\nYeah.\n\n23\n00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:46,305\nOkay.\n\n24\n00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,350\nYeah, the bulk add keyword.\n\n25\n00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:49,799\nIt should be double quotes.\n\n26\n00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:51,220\nOnly if you're doing a straight up.\n\n27\n00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,958\nIt should be double quotes.\n\n28\n00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,112\nSo that's probably why when I'm looking at them,\n\n29\n00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:56,919\nI'm seeing a single quote around them because I use the single quote.\n\n30\n00:00:57,962 --> 00:00:58,415\nYeah.\n\n31\n00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:00,818\nOnly if you're doing a phrase.\n\n32\n00:01:01,423 --> 00:01:03,140\nIf you're just doing one word, you don't need to do it.\n\n33\n00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,117\nOnly if it's a phrase.\n\n34\n00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,159\nYeah, I was doing a phrase.\n\n35\n00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,840\nSo it should have been double quotes.\n\n36\n00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:08,525\nYeah.\n\n37\n00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:10,279\nSo you'll want to do that again.\n\n38\n00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:11,817\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:14,547\nBut this time,\n\n40\n00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:16,853\nI'll make sure I put the single quotes there and tell it to remove those and then\n\n41\n00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,217\nadd back in using double quotes.\n\n42\n00:01:20,186 --> 00:01:21,496\nI wonder if you'll be able to do that.\n\n43\n00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,253\nthough.\n\n44\n00:01:22,503 --> 00:01:23,480\nLet me think about that.\n\n45\n00:01:24,223 --> 00:01:28,038\nLet me go to one of my databases I don't use very often and try something.\n\n46\n00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,745\nI don't know if that'll be ignored, to be honest.\n\n47\n00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,600\nI'm having some difficulty hearing you.\n\n48\n00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:34,882\nOkay.\n\n49\n00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,048\nSo let's say I want to add project manager to these people.\n\n50\n00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:45,689\nNo, usually it says use a single quote.\n\n51\n00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:50,836\nSo I use single quotes.\n\n52\n00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,583\nNow when I go and I look,\n\n53\n00:01:51,603 --> 00:01:55,320\nI see the single quote and my phrase and then a single quote again on their record.\n\n54\n00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,140\nI'm going, wait a minute.\n\n55\n00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:58,768\nOkay, bulk add keyword, two names, only this list.\n\n56\n00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,053\nAdd.\n\n57\n00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:12,214\nOkay, let me first try it the way you did it, but just a single quote.\n\n58\n00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:14,979\nLet's see what happens.\n\n59\n00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,005\nI think if you don't do it that way,\n\n60\n00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:31,494\nI think you're going to have a problem searching,\n\n61\n00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:32,678\nwhich would be my concern.\n\n62\n00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:35,435\nSo that's why I want to make sure.\n\n63\n00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,800\nKeywords, keywords.\n\n64\n00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,760\nI don't have that pen.\n\n65\n00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,060\nJust put the pen back.\n\n66\n00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:46,928\nOkay.\n\n67\n00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,300\nYou can remove from single quotes.\n\n68\n00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,760\nAnd then if I go bulkhead keyword project manager.\n\n69\n00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:35,160\nSo do I have to put the actual quote things in inside a double quote to remove it?\n\n70\n00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,880\nNo, I did not have to.\n\n71\n00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,860\nSo it removes the quote marks too?\n\n72\n00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,620\nI did not have to do that.\n\n73\n00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,105\nso just as you put it in because when you do double quotes it doesn't actually add\n\n74\n00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:52,802\nit",
