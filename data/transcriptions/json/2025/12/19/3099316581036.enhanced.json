    "text": "Thank you for calling SIGMIS Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, how's it going, Garrett? This is Omar with Sanford Rose IC. I am currently trying to help someone named Steve Monson with the Monson Group. And he seems to be getting just this like random pop-up on whenever he tries to go on anyone's profile and open up their attachments. And it's like a little Java screen, actually, and it says the file, what the file name has been modified. Would you like to upload the changes? And we have been able to determine that all his software is up to date, like the Java, Amazon Coreto, PCR Launcher. We've also verified that this happens with random people, not just files that have been uploaded by any of the coworkers or subordinates. And it also happens, yeah, it also happens with files that he's uploaded himself and he doesn't have any he doesn't have them open anywhere else which is very odd and there have been no changes made to the files that they're talking about okay and this is happening on like you're going to like a name record you go to the attachments tab and then that's where you're opening the attachment or is it in a different okay let me see I'm actually gonna have to look through some of my support tickets see if that was mentioned before so we'll just say the you Yeah, I haven't heard of that one before. I'm not seeing just a quick scan of our support ticket history. I'm not seeing something directly related to that. So what is the – it might be something to do with the MAC setting for the default program to open a certain file type. I wonder if it's like just like opening it one place, but the program doesn't exist. So it opens it and or, you know, not something where it might be bouncing to two programs. And that's why it's saying, oh, it's open somewhere else or being modified or something. so okay I would maybe start there to see what your default programs are set on the Mac to open things like PDFs or whichever file types you're trying on the attachments there okay yeah because it does look like it is being opened with Adobe and we do have Adobe Reader and that is yeah it's defaulting to that. We do have that as the default there. I'm sorry for not specifying that earlier. Okay, good. Okay, gotcha. Okay, so you want it to open with Adobe Reader, and it's inside Adobe Reader where you're getting that pop-up. It seems like an Adobe Reader kind of... It's the pop-up that's actually happening is Java. Am I able to send you like a screenshot or something? Yeah, let's see that. You can just email me at, I'll give you my email address whenever you're ready. Okay, one moment here. Sure. Okay, ready? So it's G as in Garrett, K-O-M as in Michael, Y-A-T as in Tom, I, so G Camayati, at main sequence dot net dot net G Komyati K-O-M-Y-A-T-I correct? Perfect, yep. Okay, let's see here. I'm just going to ... Let's refresh my inbox a couple times here, make sure. I appreciate your patience. Give me one moment here. I'm trying to attach multiples, but it's like the same essentially. Oh, yeah, no problem. Okay. All good. Oh, there it is. Okay. All right. So, select an option, which intake . Got it. Got it. And so those are both opening with the Adobe Acrobat, you said? Yeah, yeah. Right there you can see like the pencil and the pen. Yeah, okay. That's like Adobe. Got it. All right. And then if you hit, I wonder if you hit no, like the first time, does that just continuously pop up? I assume you tried maybe hitting cancel or no. You know, we have and it doesn't. And like that is the simplest solution. And it's like go through every record and just hit no on all of them. But I was wondering if you could see why that was happening on your end. Right. Okay. And, yeah, see if, like, you could, I don't know, like, log out all session. Something crazy. I have no idea what I was honestly expecting, but I thought there was, like, something that you could see or if you could see a reason as to why or where it was being directed to. If you could see if there's multiple people that have the attachment open or something like that, like a session queue or something. Like, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, that is a good. And here, let me just look at that real quick. If there's like a bunch of people logged on at once. Yeah, because the culprits are, I think it's only like two or three people, but I think the common error here is that they always have tabs open and they don't properly close the attachments. And I just wanted to see if that was the culprit there, and I could just tell them, hey, moving forward, just make sure you properly close your tabs or make sure you properly close your files and don't have like 20, 30 attachments and files open at the same time. Right. I mean, that actually could play into it. That's actually a good starting spot. I'm going to actually see if that happens on my computer. I'm going to go to, it looks like a Liz Giddings. It kind of at the top there might be the attachment, that first one. Yeah, we can do Matt Rich. That's like the newest one. Matt Rich Intake 2. The Monson group there. Attachments, Matt Rich Intake 2. Okay. Okay, so that opened up in my browser. Google Chrome, I guess, is how I'm set to see PDFs. Let's see, is there a different file type here? Uploaded photographs. That's still in the browser. Yeah, all these just opened the browser for me. But yeah, I'm not getting the pop-up, but it's definitely not opening in Acrobat for me. Let's see. Yeah, it seems like... Just having an open-end browser mitigates that issue? Yeah, it's not giving me any pop-ups or anything, but it almost makes me think that it is still computer-specific somehow. Do you know of any other users getting that pop-up on similar attachments? That might be a way to test if it's user-specific. I wasn't able to see because there was another person, Logan, there. She wasn't able to open them at all, and I was able to determine, hey, it's like the fact that your PCR launcher is out of date. Oh, good. And it's not opening them. But after that, she started opening them just fine. And I'm going to go ahead and make a couple more calls here, but I do appreciate your input on that because that may be our factor here. Because as soon as I updated her PCR launcher, she was able to open them just fine. And that wasn't even something I took into consideration, what opens the files, because if it's her web browser that opens the files, then I'd be able to just set the default like you said, right, to fix that issue, correct? It could, yeah. It could be, I think on Macs you can set, I have mine, mine's Google Chrome, But yeah, if they have a browser that supports viewing PDFs, that might be a way to get around it on that particular computer. OK, awesome. Thank you so much. No problem. Reach out if you have any more questions. Will do. Thank you.",

you?\n\n4\n00:00:06,785 --> 00:00:07,440\nHey, how's it going, Garrett?\n\n5\n00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,079\nThis is Omar with Sanford Rose IC.\n\n6\n00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:14,213\nI am currently trying to help someone named Steve Monson with the Monson Group.\n\n7\n00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,550\nAnd he seems to be getting just this like random pop-up on whenever he tries to go\n\n8\n00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,453\non anyone's profile and open up their attachments.\n\n9\n00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,385\nAnd it's like a little Java screen,\n\n10\n00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:29,726\nactually,\n\n11\n00:00:29,826 --> 00:00:30,468\nand it says the file,\n\n12\n00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,152\nwhat the file name has been modified.\n\n13\n00:00:35,664 --> 00:00:36,900\nWould you like to upload the changes?\n\n14\n00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,691\nAnd we have been able to determine that all his software is up to date,\n\n15\n00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:41,212\nlike the Java,\n\n16\n00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:42,757\nAmazon Coreto,\n\n17\n00:00:42,777 --> 00:00:43,078\nPCR Launcher.\n\n18\n00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:46,185\nWe've also verified that this happens with random people,\n\n19\n00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:51,017\nnot just files that have been uploaded by any of the coworkers or subordinates.\n\n20\n00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:01,102\nAnd it also happens,\n\n21\n00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:01,642\nyeah,\n\n22\n00:01:01,702 --> 00:01:06,004\nit also happens with files that he's uploaded himself and he doesn't have any he\n\n23\n00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,705\ndoesn't have them open anywhere else which is very odd and there have been no\n\n24\n00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:13,486\nchanges made to the files that they're talking about okay and this is happening on\n\n25\n00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,727\nlike you're going to like a name record you go to the attachments tab and then\n\n26\n00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:19,568\nthat's where you're opening the attachment or is it in a different okay let me see\n\n27\n00:01:20,008 --> 00:01:24,629\nI'm actually gonna have to look through some of my support tickets see if that was\n\n28\n00:01:24,669 --> 00:01:26,750\nmentioned before so we'll just say the you Yeah,\n\n29\n00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,470\nI haven't heard of that one before.\n\n30\n00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,860\nI'm not seeing just a quick scan of our support ticket history.\n\n31\n00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:09,360\nI'm not seeing something directly related to that.\n\n32\n00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:20,537\nSo what is the – it might be something to do with the MAC setting for the default\n\n33\n00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,739\nprogram to open a certain file type.\n\n34\n00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:29,559\nI wonder if it's like just like opening it one place, but the program doesn't exist.\n\n35\n00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,542\nSo it opens it and or,\n\n36\n00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:30,723\nyou know,\n\n37\n00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:34,860\nnot something where it might be bouncing to two programs.\n\n38\n00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,083\nAnd that's why it's saying,\n\n39\n00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:36,144\noh,\n\n40\n00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:37,270\nit's open somewhere else or being modified or something.\n\n41\n00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,325\nso okay I would maybe start there to see what your default programs are set on the\n\n42\n00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:52,410\nMac to open things like PDFs or whichever file types you're trying on the\n\n43\n00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:01,437\nattachments there okay yeah because it does look like it is being opened with Adobe\n\n44\n00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:03,918\nand we do have Adobe Reader and that is yeah it's defaulting to that.\n\n45\n00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,657\nWe do have that as the default there.\n\n46\n00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,377\nI'm sorry for not specifying that earlier.\n\n47\n00:03:10,647 --> 00:03:11,018\nOkay, good.\n\n48\n00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,452\nOkay, gotcha.\n\n49\n00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:12,221\nOkay,\n\n50\n00:03:12,241 --> 00:03:13,565\nso you want it to open with Adobe Reader,\n\n51\n00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:15,711\nand it's inside Adobe Reader where you're getting that pop-up.\n\n52\n00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,275\nIt seems like an Adobe Reader kind of...\n\n53\n00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,534\nIt's the pop-up that's actually happening is Java.\n\n54\n00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,676\nAm I able to send you like a screenshot or something?\n\n55\n00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:32,450\nYeah, let's see that.\n\n56\n00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:36,954\nYou can just email me at, I'll give you my email address whenever you're ready.\n\n57\n00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,980\nOkay, one moment here.\n\n58\n00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:40,324\nSure.\n\n59\n00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,163\nOkay, ready?\n\n60\n00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,122\nSo it's G as in Garrett,\n\n61\n00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:54,682\nK-O-M as in
