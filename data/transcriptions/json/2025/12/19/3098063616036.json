    "text": "Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. Noel Glaser calling. Hey, Noel. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. How are you doing? I am well. I am well. You didn't get my email. I did. I did. So I read that the second time after. It made a little more sense. The first time. It's a little confusing the way it's written. It is. And I think normally when the contract is new, yes, it would be the setup in the first month. when it's an upgrade or a move to PCRM, it's really that you do pay that 300, but that's going to be paid the next time your monthly goes. It's not upfront. So the only upfront is just the setup. Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. So then the invoice is 300 is what I'm seeing. It's just for the hours. Okay. Yep. All right. So where do I need to, let me go back to that. Let's see what the date was that you sent that. Last week. Was that Tuesday last week? I think it was. I sent the bulk right on Tuesday. It wasn't for a trade show I'm going to, so it's just lost in here. It came. It was created. Let's see what my date is on here. The 17th. So Wednesday, it looks like it was created. Wednesday and Wednesday. Oh, shit. Coming up soon. Okay. Okay. Go back to Wednesday. I know what to do. I put it right where it belongs in the PCR file. Imagine that, right? PCR support. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so once that's signed, it'll come to me. I'll countersign it. Then they'll send the invoice out shortly after for just the setup. Once that's paid, then they adjust it internally so that just whenever the next payment goes through, it'll be for the new rate at the new account of users and everything like that. all right perfect all right good you'll see that here uh my question to you is i want to request that we get garrett as a trainer as i understand he gets this pcrm very well yeah i can certainly request him for sure he is great with that absolutely okay perfect and then how soon can we get this thing started understanding i have a trade show coming up that i really want to get um at least one in our belt before we head out uh when do you go uh monday a week from yesterday Yeah, we should be able to get something today. As long as Garrett's schedule permits, I can get everything that I need done. We can get it installed in about a day. So yeah, as long as Garrett's schedule permits, we should be able to do that. Maybe start it Friday even. That would be good. That might be possible, yeah. As long as he's good. He's good on my end. It just means make sure he has the availability. Okay. All right. Perfect. All right. That's been sent. You should see that hopefully now. Very well. I will go ahead and get it moving quick. and then let me know what his schedule looks like. And then we'll go from there. Yeah, if I can get it. The reason being, if I can set up, I want to use, there's that part of PCRM that I forgot what the term is, that you could track my business development. What's the word I'm looking for here? Is it the email campaigns or the sequences or the deals pipeline? Deals, deals pipeline. I really want to use that deals pipeline. And if I'm at the show and I'm on the mobile app, is there a mobile app for this thing? I mean, think about that. Oh, there's a mobile app. I don't know that the mobile app works with PCRM specifically. I think it will access the same database, but I don't think deals is written in a mobile app right now. Yeah. All right. Well, I'll have them when I get back. I can track it through email, and then when I come back, I'm going to put them on my deal screen so I have a way to track everybody and really looking forward to using that part of it and sequencing it out after the show. Fantastic. I'll go ahead and get it moving as quick as I can. All right. Perfect. Perfect. All right. Good. Thanks, Jim. All right. Thank you, sir. Take care. All right. Bye. Bye.",

00:00:04,474\nNoel Glaser calling.\n\n5\n00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:05,410\nHey, Noel.\n\n6\n00:00:05,664 --> 00:00:05,959\nHow are you?\n\n7\n00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:06,512\nI'm good.\n\n8\n00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:06,980\nI'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:07,477\nHow are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,211\nI am well.\n\n11\n00:00:08,687 --> 00:00:08,913\nI am well.\n\n12\n00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,380\nYou didn't get my email.\n\n13\n00:00:10,988 --> 00:00:11,177\nI did.\n\n14\n00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:11,580\nI did.\n\n15\n00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,334\nSo I read that the second time after.\n\n16\n00:00:14,843 --> 00:00:15,658\nIt made a little more sense.\n\n17\n00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:16,517\nThe first time.\n\n18\n00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,380\nIt's a little confusing the way it's written.\n\n19\n00:00:20,213 --> 00:00:20,379\nIt is.\n\n20\n00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,765\nAnd I think normally when the contract is new,\n\n21\n00:00:21,785 --> 00:00:21,886\nyes,\n\n22\n00:00:22,187 --> 00:00:24,738\nit would be the setup in the first month.\n\n23\n00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:26,684\nwhen it's an upgrade or a move to PCRM,\n\n24\n00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:27,870\nit's really that you do pay that 300,\n\n25\n00:00:31,235 --> 00:00:33,120\nbut that's going to be paid the next time your monthly goes.\n\n26\n00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:33,917\nIt's not upfront.\n\n27\n00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,434\nSo the only upfront is just the setup.\n\n28\n00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,188\nYeah.\n\n29\n00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:36,788\nRight.\n\n30\n00:00:37,423 --> 00:00:37,627\nRight.\n\n31\n00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,488\nOkay.\n\n32\n00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,690\nSo then the invoice is 300 is what I'm seeing.\n\n33\n00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,740\nIt's just for the hours.\n\n34\n00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:44,438\nOkay.\n\n35\n00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:44,738\nYep.\n\n36\n00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:44,948\nAll right.\n\n37\n00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,318\nSo where do I need to, let me go back to that.\n\n38\n00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:53,057\nLet's see what the date was that you sent that.\n\n39\n00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,632\nLast week.\n\n40\n00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,279\nWas that Tuesday last week?\n\n41\n00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,044\nI think it was.\n\n42\n00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:07,489\nI sent the bulk right on Tuesday.\n\n43\n00:01:09,243 --> 00:01:11,998\nIt wasn't for a trade show I'm going to, so it's just lost in here.\n\n44\n00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,510\nIt came.\n\n45\n00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,660\nIt was created.\n\n46\n00:01:14,962 --> 00:01:16,120\nLet's see what my date is on here.\n\n47\n00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:16,425\nThe 17th.\n\n48\n00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,980\nSo Wednesday, it looks like it was created.\n\n49\n00:01:19,748 --> 00:01:20,211\nWednesday and Wednesday.\n\n50\n00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:21,288\nOh, shit.\n\n51\n00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:22,519\nComing up soon.\n\n52\n00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:23,441\nOkay.\n\n53\n00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:24,363\nOkay.\n\n54\n00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:44,611\nGo back to Wednesday.\n\n55\n00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,656\nI know what to do.\n\n56\n00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,070\nI put it right where it belongs in the PCR file.\n\n57\n00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:18,658\nImagine that, right?\n\n58\n00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,018\nPCR support.\n\n59\n00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:39,149\nOkay.\n\n60\n00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:49,280\nOkay.\n\n61\n00:02:59,183 --> 00:02:59,411\nOkay.\n\n62\n00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,880\nOkay, so once that's signed, it'll come to me.\n\n63\n00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,720\nI'll countersign it.\n\n64\n00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,900\nThen they'll send the invoice out shortly after for just the setup.\n\n65\n00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:29,018\nPCR support.\n\n66\n00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,940\nOnce that's paid,\n\n67\n00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,487\nthen they adjust it internally so that just whenever the next payment goes through,\n\n68\n00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:34,540\nit'll be for the new rate at the new account of users and everything like that.\n\n69\n00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:39,149\nOkay.\n\n70\n00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:49,280\nOkay.\n\n71\n00:02:59,183 --> 00:02:59,411\nOkay.\n\n72\n00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,299\nall right perfect all right good you'll see that here
