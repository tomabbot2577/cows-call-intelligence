    "text": "Hi, Robin. My name is Debbie Schumacher. I got a new computer and, well, I want to install the PCR app into my Outlook. And I have downloaded it and I've tried to do it and I can't get it to work. So I don't know what I'm doing wrong. and so like after I download it I enter the data that I had on previous the previous computer but then it doesn't like give me the option to even look at it or view it in the screen um in Outlook and administrator uh I don't know I just installed the the when you were installing the program when you were installing the add-in? Were you prompted for like an administrator password of your computer? I don't know. I don't remember. We could do a screen share. What is your email address? D. Schumacher. At Electronic Search? At Electronic Search, yeah. But I uninstalled the app. I uninstalled it and then tried to reinstall it, and it still enters the license code that I have or the serial number. So it still remembers it. So I don't know if I can like fix what you're talking about. Well, the other thing is it may, it's not giving you like an invalid or expired message, right? Right. Okay. I'll just get the connection. We'll figure it out though. Okay. I'm going to send you. Do you have any of RingCentral? RingCentral. No, I don't think I have that on this computer. I'm going to just send you a Google Meet invite then. Okay. You can get an email from me in just a moment. Okay. Now when you get that meeting invite and you go to join the meeting, it'll ask you about sharing your camera possibly and joining audio. We won't need either of those because we're on the phone. We also don't need to share camera because we're going to be sharing screen instead. Okay. I'll walk you through that more. So it's an email that you're sending to me? Yes. To Dee Schumacher? Okay. I've not got it yet. I think I can go to spam. Does it usually take a minute or two? Not too long. I'm sending it directly from my Gmail account. All right, let me see if I went to spam. It's possible since it has a link in it. Yeah, since it's from a Gmail. I'm going to try resending it too Let me finish this Hey Schumacher, the electronics All right, we're going to try something else right now It seems like I'm having another issue. I'm going to just restart my Outlook. And you are in the classic version of Outlook, right? You're not in, like, the new app? Okay. Is that the app one? Yeah. It won't support it if it's in the new. Okay. I don't support add-ins. I didn't get your email. Are you spelling D. Schumacher correctly? I just took right off your record. Oh, I should have. I sent it to, yeah, D-S-C-H-U-M-A-C-H-E-R at electronicsearch.com. Yes, that's it. And then get it in there. See, now it's opening two versions of my Outlook after I put in the portal every time I click on the Outlook button. Like, why? Let's see. Okay, that's weird. Let me check one more chunk, please. Oh, there it is. Okay. Let's see. I need to... I want to mark me safe. ...the block sender. okay moved it to index there we go join call there we go that should be good don't need to continue without microphone and camera and join now. There we go. Okay. Right? You can see? Okay. Yeah. So what you're going to make sure you do is just make sure you're muted and then... I am muted over here. Yeah. Yep. Are you not seeing my screen? Robin? Robin? Can you hear me? Yeah, now I can hear you. Hello? Hello? Shoot, I don't know how to turn on the microphone. Oh, there it is. Hey, can you hear me? Robin? Shoot. Can you hear me? Yeah, I thought we were talking on the phone, so I hit mute on everything. Oh, yeah. But now it's not letting me unmute. What? Yeah, I'm not sure what happened there. Okay. So we don't have any feedback, so that's good. Okay. All right, so what I'm going to have you do is click share screen at the bottom of your meeting screen. The rectangle with the arrow. Rectangle, okay. That's going to pop up another window. Go over at the right where it says entire screen. Yep. And then if you have more than one, monitor. Make sure you're picking the right one. Okay, I only have one. okay okay so let's go ahead and open up your outlook for me down at the very bottom okay yep okay let's do this let's go to file up at the top left nope sorry top left okay i didn't it's not installed right now just so you know okay and let's go to options okay and see where it says optimize for compatibility no a little radio button up near the top there it says optimize optimize for best appearance is selected we want the option right below that perfect okay okay and then i just want to see if it really did okay um so did you download the app already yeah it's in okay and then did you run the file yep I did okay so let's while we're here let's just see if it really is kind of there and just not sure let's go back to your outlook well I uninstalled it from my outlook yeah because it wasn't working and it was making my outlook open twice or my yeah my outlook opened twice and um the login screen or whatever. Okay, which one? The downloads folder. And okay, let's open and run that file. And where it says you want this app to exchange to your device, you'll hit yes. And then click next. Yep. I accept the terms. Next. Next. install. Yeah, kind of fly through those. Okay, hit finish. Okay, let's close and open your Outlook. Okay. Let me close that for now. Okay. Let's see. Yes. Do it happen here? Yeah, because it needs to know how to connect to the database. So go over to your PCR login screen, like in your browser. This one? Yeah, that one will work. Copy that URL. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's hover on the Outlook, but go to that first little pop-up window that you see. That one right there. Click Add Connection. Take that out and replace it with what you just copied. Click go. And hit go? Yes. Okay. Oh. And your PCR username? I did this the first time for sure. And then it's this database. Okay. Okay. The Google Meet thing at the bottom, see where it says hide? Go ahead and click that. Okay. See, it's not giving me anything to do after that. Oh, that's weird. Okay. Yeah. Oh, I wonder if that changes the new login screen. Let me just think about something here. Yeah, this is what happened the first time. So then I X'd out of it because I was like, maybe I don't need this. And then I tried entering all the data that was the same on the other screen or the next screen from my old computer. And it did add it to Outlook. So I had the options to hit name and everything. but there was no ability. When I hit name, it didn't take me to the name. It didn't take me to the screen. It didn't show anything. So then I tried restarting, and then it started my Outlook twice with the login thing again. Does that make sense? Are you still there? What is happening? Hello? Hello? Sure. Hi, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you there. But you can't hear me. It says my microphone's on. Sigh. Sigh. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Ding. Can you type the number that I should call you back at? I can get this get this ring central back to working. Okay.",

it still enters the license code that I have or the serial number.\n\n23\n00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:28,758\nSo it still remembers it.\n\n24\n00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,720\nSo I don't know if I can like fix what you're talking about.\n\n25\n00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,802\nWell,\n\n26\n00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:35,007\nthe other thing is it may,\n\n27\n00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:38,020\nit's not giving you

going to send you.\n\n35\n00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,239\nDo you have any of RingCentral?\n\n36\n00:01:57,823 --> 00:01:59,200\nRingCentral.\n\n37\n00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240\nNo, I don't think I have that on this computer.\n\n38\n00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,540\nI'm going to just send you a Google Meet invite then.\n\n39\n00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:04,486\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:02:04,880 -->

the meeting,\n\n43\n00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,834\nit'll ask you about sharing your camera possibly and joining audio.\n\n44\n00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,138\nWe won't need either of those because we're on the phone.\n\n45\n00:02:58,071 --> 00:03:01,698\nWe also don't need to share camera because we're going to be sharing screen instead.\n\n46\n00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:10,873\nOkay.\n\n47\n00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,257\nI'll walk you through that more.\n\n48\n00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,366\nSo it's an email that you're sending to me?\n\n49\n00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:41,541\nYes.\n\n50\n00:03:50,474 -->

my Gmail account.\n\n57\n00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,759\nAll right, let me see if I went to spam.\n\n58\n00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:44,040\nIt's possible since it has a link in it.\n\n59\n00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,117\nYeah, since it's from a Gmail.\n\n60\n00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:00,374\nOkay.\n\n61\n00:04:09,307 --> 00:03:59,902\nI've not got it I'm going to try resending it too Let me finish this
