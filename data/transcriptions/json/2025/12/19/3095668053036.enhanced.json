    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Jeanette from Job.com. How are you today? Good. How are you? Pretty good for a Monday. It's early. So quick question for you. They are asking about setting up a job board, what we need to do from PCR to whatever website we're using. and are there like specs for that anywhere we used to use it when we were with princeton one way back when like 2022 2023 but i don't know what's changed since then okay yeah um so yeah the process for that we would basically send you a questionnaire that you can answer questions about what you want shown on the job board like do you want to hide the salary do you want to hide the company, show the company. And then once you fill that out, our web developer will start building it to kind of match your colors and fonts on your website. And then they'll get in contact with you or your web developer on your end and give them an HTML block of code to just copy and paste into your web page on your website. Okay, so nothing specific. The website doesn't have to be built like in WordPress or anything? No. Yeah, I think our web developers experience in a good handful of different website builders. So, yeah. Because I don't even know if they're going to use the existing job.com one or another one now, but I just told Mike to call and check. What's the cost for setting that up? Let me check. I believe it is included with your... Yeah, it's included with your PCR subscription. Oh, great. And how long do you think turnaround time in terms of if we got the info together after we filled out the questionnaire, like a month or? It should only take about a week is how it usually goes, unless there's very specific things you want done. But, yeah, just putting it in the in the queue for our web developer to work on usually gets to it within the week. Okay, great. And then I'll go over with you guys when we get that done, like what we do internally, because it used to be had to have, you know, more than one position, some button I had to click to make sure it was live, you know, like three different things I had to do to make sure it went wherever. Yeah, exactly. Those fields are the, it has to be available slash open as the status. Number of openings has to be one or more. If it goes to zero, it would come down from the site. And then last one's just a field called show on web where you can put it to show or do not show. So when those three are in harmony, it shows up on the job board. Great. Thank you so much. Well, that answers my question. I hope you have a good quiet day. Yeah, no problem. Would you like me to send you that questionnaire now? Sure. Yeah, that'd be great. Okay, yeah. I'll email that to you now, and then we could get the process started. Okay, great. I'll let them know what I found out, and then we'll just go from there. Thank you so much. Sounds good. Have a great day. Thank you, too. Bye-bye.",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:08,160\nHey, Garrett.\n\n5\n00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:09,399\nIt's Jeanette from Job.com.\n\n6\n00:00:09,642 --> 00:00:10,419\nHow are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:11,297\nGood.\n\n8\n00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:11,550\nHow are you?\n\n9\n00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:13,213\nPretty good for a Monday.\n\n10\n00:00:13,864 --> 00:00:14,233\nIt's early.\n\n11\n00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,331\nSo quick question for you.\n\n12\n00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,426\nThey are asking about setting up a job board,\n\n13\n00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:23,833\nwhat we need to do from PCR to whatever website we're using.\n\n14\n00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,983\nand are there like specs for that anywhere we used to use it when we were with\n\n15\n00:00:30,003 --> 00:00:32,504\nprinceton one way back when like 2022 2023 but i don't know what's changed since\n\n16\n00:00:32,744 --> 00:00:36,407\nthen okay yeah um so yeah the process for that we would basically send you a\n\n17\n00:00:36,707 --> 00:00:39,709\nquestionnaire that you can answer questions about what you want shown on the job\n\n18\n00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,911\nboard like do you want to hide the salary do you want to hide the company,\n\n19\n00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:43,412\nshow the company.\n\n20\n00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,642\nAnd then once you fill that out,\n\n21\n00:00:57,063 --> 00:01:00,330\nour web developer will start building it to kind of match your colors and fonts on\n\n22\n00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:00,671\nyour website.\n\n23\n00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,026\nAnd then they'll get in contact with you or your web developer on your end and give\n\n24\n00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:12,390\nthem an HTML block of code to just copy and paste into your web page on your\n\n25\n00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,550\nwebsite.\n\n26\n00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,708\nOkay, so nothing specific.\n\n27\n00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,113\nThe website doesn't have to be built like in WordPress or anything?\n\n28\n00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:27,903\nNo.\n\n29\n00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:28,760\nYeah,\n\n30\n00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:32,712\nI think our web developers experience in a good handful of different website\n\n31\n00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:32,953\nbuilders.\n\n32\n00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:36,986\nSo, yeah.\n\n33\n00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,411\nBecause I don't even know if they're going to use the existing job.com one or\n\n34\n00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:40,953\nanother one now,\n\n35\n00:01:40,973 --> 00:01:42,700\nbut I just told Mike to call and check.\n\n36\n00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,600\nWhat's the cost for setting that up?\n\n37\n00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,500\nLet me check.\n\n38\n00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,240\nI believe it is included with your...\n\n39\n00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,000\nYeah, it's included with your PCR subscription.\n\n40\n00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,640\nOh, great.\n\n41\n00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,740\nAnd how long do you think turnaround time in terms of if we got the info together\n\n42\n00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,540\nafter we filled out the questionnaire,\n\n43\n00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,740\nlike a month or?\n\n44\n00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,828\nIt should only take about a week is how it usually goes,\n\n45\n00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:13,820\nunless there's very specific things you want done.\n\n46\n00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,341\nBut,\n\n47\n00:02:14,341 --> 00:02:14,682\nyeah,\n\n48\n00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:20,476\njust putting it in the in the queue for our web developer to work on usually gets\n\n49\n00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,180\nto it within the week.\n\n50\n00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,040\nOkay, great.\n\n51\n00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,004\nAnd then I'll go over with you guys when we get that done,\n\n52\n00:02:27,004 --> 00:02:28,144\nlike what we do internally,\n\n53\n00:02:28,144 --> 00:02:29,968\nbecause it used to be had to have,\n\n54\n00:02:29,968 --> 00:02:30,424\nyou know,\n\n55\n00:02:30,424 --> 00:02:31,336\nmore than one position,\n\n56\n00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:34,072\nsome button I had to click to make sure it was live,\n\n57\n00:02:34,072 --> 00:02:34,528\nyou know,\n\n58\n00:02:34,528 --> 00:02:37,720\nlike three different things I had to do to make sure it went wherever.\n\n59\n00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,180\nYeah, exactly.\n\n60\n00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,600\nThose fields are the, it has to be available slash open as the status.\n\n61\n00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,120\nNumber of openings has to be one or more.\n\n62\n00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,540\nIf it goes to zero, it would come down from the site.\n\n63\n00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,907\nAnd then last one's just a field called show on web where you can put it to show or\n\n64\n00:02:57,907 --> 00:02:58,720\ndo not show.\n\n65\n00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,620\nSo when those three are in harmony, it shows up on the job board.\n\n66\n00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,120\nGreat.\n\n67\n00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,820\nThank you so much.\n\n68\n00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,300\nWell, that answers my question.\n\n69\n00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,800\nI hope you have a good quiet day.\n\n70\n00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10",
