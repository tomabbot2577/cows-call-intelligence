    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. How are you today? This is Glenn Grayson at J. Aaron Associates. Good. How are you doing? Good. I got a question for you. I recently just made a transition to RingCentral, and I called you guys up because that little phone icon next to the phone numbers wasn't working. So they got that all squared away, And so that's working fine. But the text bubbled. I can't use a text part of it. So is there something else I need to do for the texting aspect? Let me double check your setup for whatever username you're trying to use that with. Are you in the J. Aaron Associates or J. Aaron HCP database? J. Aaron Associates. Okay. And then I'll just log in as the admin user. And which username is having the issue with texting so far? J. Grayson. Okay, got that. Check the settings. Okay, so you do have the phone numbers filled out in the right place in the file. So if you click on the, let's see, I'm going to try it on my end. Oh, yeah, I'm seeing that as well, where there is no texting button. Let me try something else. I have the texting button. I just, when I click it, nothing happens. Oh, okay. Like it doesn't open up the RingCentral box or anything like that. Does it open up the, like, add activity window at all? It does open up that activity window. Oh, I see. So at the top right of that, it'll list whatever phone numbers you have available. You'll have to click on one of those phone numbers for the text pop up to appear. Oh, so it's not just a single click that I just got to when I go into there. I see. Yeah. Yeah. And they don't make that too clear. So I do. I do. I run into that, too, where I forget. I'm like, where's my text box? And then I'm like, oh yeah, I have to go up there and click on an actual phone number. But yeah, hopefully they adjust that a little bit and give you a better direction on that pop-up what to do. I mean this is the first I've had a landline for god knows how many years and I just finally decided to to suck it up and go to uh VoIP phone and so all this stuff is new to me and it's nice that it's all integrated and I love it but yeah I'm working through a little bit of these little things that you don't even think to ask right that's that was just it so now that I see that I get it because as soon as I hover on that it brings up my window and let me make yeah and you should be able to type your message there and then i'm sending oh i wonder if i'm because i'm because i'm on that line right now oh okay perfect that worked excellent that worked all right anything else you've been having trouble with no i think that's about it i appreciate it though all righty well happy to help and definitely call back if you have any other questions or issues that pop up around that and have a great rest of your day you do the same thanks so much thanks",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:07,561 --> 00:00:07,914\nHey, Garrett.\n\n5\n00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:08,620\nHow are you today?\n\n6\n00:00:08,883 --> 00:00:09,857\nThis is Glenn Grayson at J.\n\n7\n00:00:10,182 --> 00:00:10,999\nAaron Associates.\n\n8\n00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:12,208\nGood.\n\n9\n00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,138\nHow are you doing?\n\n10\n00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:14,419\nGood.\n\n11\n00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,679\nI got a question for you.\n\n12\n00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,045\nI recently just made a transition to RingCentral,\n\n13\n00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:22,832\nand I called you guys up because that little phone icon next to the phone numbers\n\n14\n00:00:23,092 --> 00:00:24,294\nwasn't working.\n\n15\n00:00:28,603 --> 00:00:31,360\nSo they got that all squared away, And so that's working fine.\n\n16\n00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:32,205\nBut the text bubbled.\n\n17\n00:00:34,903 --> 00:00:36,838\nI can't use a text part of it.\n\n18\n00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,893\nSo is there something else I need to do for the texting aspect?\n\n19\n00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:46,150\nLet me double check your setup for whatever username you're trying to use that with.\n\n20\n00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,156\nAre you in the J.\n\n21\n00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,600\nAaron Associates or J.\n\n22\n00:00:53,408 --> 00:00:54,318\nAaron HCP database?\n\n23\n00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:54,481\nJ.\n\n24\n00:00:55,461 --> 00:00:56,199\nAaron Associates.\n\n25\n00:00:56,403 --> 00:00:56,505\nOkay.\n\n26\n00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,250\nAnd then I'll just log in as the admin user.\n\n27\n00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,449\nAnd which username is having the issue with texting so far?\n\n28\n00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:06,762\nJ.\n\n29\n00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,339\nGrayson.\n\n30\n00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:08,348\nOkay, got that.\n\n31\n00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,873\nCheck the settings.\n\n32\n00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,431\nOkay, so you do have the phone numbers filled out in the right place in the file.\n\n33\n00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,351\nSo if you click on the, let's see, I'm going to try it on my end.\n\n34\n00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:28,014\nOh, yeah, I'm seeing that as well, where there is no texting button.\n\n35\n00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,296\nLet me try something else.\n\n36\n00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,800\nI have the texting button.\n\n37\n00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,452\nI just, when I click it, nothing happens.\n\n38\n00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:37,340\nOh, okay.\n\n39\n00:01:37,642 --> 00:01:40,020\nLike it doesn't open up the RingCentral box or anything like that.\n\n40\n00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,351\nDoes it open up the, like, add activity window at all?\n\n41\n00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,020\nIt does open up that activity window.\n\n42\n00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,180\nOh, I see.\n\n43\n00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,980\nSo at the top right of that, it'll list whatever phone numbers you have available.\n\n44\n00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,660\nYou'll have to click on one of those phone numbers for the text pop up to appear.\n\n45\n00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:07,800\nOh, so it's not just a single click that I just got to when I go into there.\n\n46\n00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:08,860\nI see.\n\n47\n00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,160\nYeah.\n\n48\n00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,740\nYeah.\n\n49\n00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,300\nAnd they don't make that too clear.\n\n50\n00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,840\nSo I do.\n\n51\n00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,280\nI do.\n\n52\n00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,340\nI run into that, too, where I forget.\n\n53\n00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,423\nI'm like, where's my text box?\n\n54\n00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:21,119\nAnd then I'm like,\n\n55\n00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:21,506\noh yeah,\n\n56\n00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,023\nI have to go up there and click on an actual phone number.\n\n57\n00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:25,332\nBut yeah,\n\n58\n00:02:25,332 --> 00:02:28,236\nhopefully they adjust that a little bit and give you a better direction on that\n\n59\n00:02:28,236 --> 00:02:29,010\npop-up what to do.\n\n60\n00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:33,416\nI mean this is the first I've had a landline for god knows how many years and I\n\n61\n00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:37,094\njust finally decided to to suck it up and go to uh VoIP phone and so all this stuff\n\n62\n00:02:37,094 -->

even think to\n\n64\n00:02:43,482 --> 00:02:47,160\nask right that's that was just it so now that I see that I get it because as soon\n\n65\n00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,838\nas I hover on that it brings
