    "text": "Hello, this is Kim. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. We received your voicemail. You're interested in the AI. Awesome. Yeah. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. Now, it's my understanding this is a free service at this time, correct? Yes, we have a free trial out to all of our customers. We would just need your PCR contract signer to request that AI search or AI candidate match are added to your free trial. It looks like your contract signer is, let's see, Jackie Bandish. We would just need an email from her. You could send it to support at main sequence dot net. But, yeah, we would just look over your database and see if any updates need to be made. We would kind of give you all heads up on what those updates would be. It would mostly just be a kind of a reindex that you wouldn't even hardly notice so that the new features can be plugged in and installed. Okay. Okay. Do you know how long this is going to be free to users? So, yeah, the management hasn't really indicated to us how long they want to let the free trial ride. I imagine it'll be for a while because they haven't decided on a date to end it. But we will give everyone a heads up in advance if it's going to be cut off or ending. So you can make a decision if you want to keep it and pay for it or just let it expire. Okay. And do you have a ballpark as to have you guys discussed what the pricing will be? Oh, yes. So the pricing is part of one of the PCR packages. That kind of changes based on where you are currently in your contract, what you're currently paying. So we could always have our sales rep, Jim Lombardo, reach out to you and discuss your options based on how your current contract is set up. If you do feel like you want to move forward with adding AI. Okay. All right. Perfect. I'll let Jackie know about this. I had seen it. I saw the update on there today. I know you guys have been doing some work, so I saw it and I watched the videos and things like that. So I'm not even sure that Jackie's aware that it's there. But so I just wanted to gather as much information as possible before I, you know, relayed information to her. Yeah, that makes sense. Just have her send us an email. I think on that blog post you were referencing, there's like even a sign-up form that she could just fill in her name and email and we'll get the process rolling for your account. Yeah, I did see something there too. When I went back, I couldn't find it, but I can try to either just email or we'll fill out that form and we're good. Perfect. How long do you think it takes once we set everything in motion? It should be turned on within two or three days is what we've seen so far for each account. Perfect. All right. Thanks, Garrett. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",

00:00:06,399\nWe received your voicemail.\n\n4\n00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,918\nYou're interested in the AI.\n\n5\n00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:09,192\nAwesome.\n\n6\n00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:10,357\nYeah.\n\n7\n00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,010\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:11,824 --> 00:00:11,967\nGood.\n\n9\n00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:12,956\nHow are you?\n\n10\n00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:13,203\nGood.\n\n11\n00:00:14,201 --> 00:00:17,234\nNow, it's my understanding this is a free service at this time, correct?\n\n12\n00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,949\nYes, we have a free trial out to all of our customers.\n\n13\n00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,365\nWe would just need your PCR contract signer to request that AI search or AI\n\n14\n00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,629\ncandidate match are added to your free trial.\n\n15\n00:00:37,344 --> 00:00:40,555\nIt looks like your contract signer is, let's see, Jackie Bandish.\n\n16\n00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,427\nWe would just need an email from her.\n\n17\n00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,954\nYou could send it to support at main sequence dot net.\n\n18\n00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,281\nBut,\n\n19\n00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:51,542\nyeah,\n\n20\n00:00:51,562 --> 00:00:55,075\nwe would just look over your database and see if any updates need to be made.\n\n21\n00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,417\nWe would kind of give you all heads up on what those updates would be.\n\n22\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,148\nIt would mostly just be a kind of a reindex that you wouldn't even hardly notice so\n\n23\n00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,272\nthat the new features can be plugged in and installed.\n\n24\n00:01:12,248 --> 00:01:12,454\nOkay.\n\n25\n00:01:12,804 --> 00:01:13,050\nOkay.\n\n26\n00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:16,918\nDo you know how long this is going to be free to users?\n\n27\n00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:18,601\nSo,\n\n28\n00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:18,721\nyeah,\n\n29\n00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:21,812\nthe management hasn't really indicated to us how long they want to let the free\n\n30\n00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:22,475\ntrial ride.\n\n31\n00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,157\nI imagine it'll be for a while because they haven't decided on a date to end it.\n\n32\n00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,496\nBut we will give everyone a heads up in advance if it's going to be cut off or\n\n33\n00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:33,898\nending.\n\n34\n00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,457\nSo you can make a decision if you want to keep it and pay for it or just let it\n\n35\n00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:39,779\nexpire.\n\n36\n00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:40,305\nOkay.\n\n37\n00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,540\nAnd do you have a ballpark as to have you guys discussed what the pricing will be?\n\n38\n00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,020\nOh, yes.\n\n39\n00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,940\nSo the pricing is part of one of the PCR packages.\n\n40\n00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,164\nThat kind of changes based on where you are currently in your contract,\n\n41\n00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,740\nwhat you're currently paying.\n\n42\n00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,633\nSo we could always have our sales rep,\n\n43\n00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:06,367\nJim Lombardo,\n\n44\n00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:12,233\nreach out to you and discuss your options based on how your current contract is set\n\n45\n00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:12,600\nup.\n\n46\n00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,340\nIf you do feel like you want to move forward with adding AI.\n\n47\n00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,820\nOkay.\n\n48\n00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,520\nAll right.\n\n49\n00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,940\nPerfect.\n\n50\n00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,880\nI'll let Jackie know about this.\n\n51\n00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,660\nI had seen it.\n\n52\n00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,120\nI saw the update on there today.\n\n53\n00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,881\nI know you guys have been doing some work,\n\n54\n00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:29,280\nso I saw it and I watched the videos and things like that.\n\n55\n00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,980\nSo I'm not even sure that Jackie's aware that it's there.\n\n56\n00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,820\nBut so I just wanted to gather as much information as possible before I,\n\n57\n00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,440\nyou know,\n\n58\n00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680\nrelayed information to her.\n\n59\n00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,360\nYeah, that makes sense.\n\n60\n00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,060\nJust have her send us an email.\n\n61\n00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,232\nI think on that blog post you were referencing,\n\n62\n00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:52,072\nthere's like even a sign-up form that she could just fill in her name and email and\n\n63\n00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,820\nwe'll get the process rolling for your account.\n\n64\n00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,240\nYeah, I did see something there too.\n\n65\n00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,244\nWhen I went back,\n\n66\n00:02:58,244 --> 00:02:59,188\nI couldn't find it,\n\n67\n00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:03,200\nbut I can try to either just email or we'll fill out that form and we're good.\n\n68\n00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:03,860\nPerfect.\n\n69\n00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,880\nHow long do you think it takes once we set everything in motion?\n\n70\n00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:16,688\nIt should be t",
