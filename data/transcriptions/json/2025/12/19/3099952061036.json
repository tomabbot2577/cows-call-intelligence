    "text": "Hey, what's up, Nick? Hey. So James wants me to have you run or have you as like a point person for escalations while I'm gone. Okay. Because there's not really anyone else and Bill won't end up doing them. so I'll talk about it at the support meeting tomorrow but basically if they have issues they can just take it to you and then if it's like fuck you guys this is how we do it yeah I mean if so if it's not urgent and you don't know what to do with it they can wait until I get back then let me know if it is urgent, there's a couple different options. You can send me a message on Discord if you want to. I'm going to go through my emails once a day or once every other day so I can eventually respond to you. But I'm not really going to do any real work. So if you know what to do with it you need to answer. You can either take it to James or Bill. It kind of depends on what it is. So if you don't know what to do, let me know and then I'll tell you. Like, hey, I know what to do here. Who do I need to talk to to make sure I come to my bases? Yeah, and if it's not super important, then whatever. But you'll be good to, they can you get good suggestions for stuff with troubleshooting and things like that. So that'll make it easier. Yeah, for what? A week? Yeah, so I'll be gone. I'm working tomorrow morning. Probably done at noon. And then I'm out Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. I'll be back on Thursday. So it's not that long workday-wise. It's only really four of them. just in case. If there's anything crazy that happens. Oh, also tomorrow. I'll bring it up tomorrow in the meeting. So, yeah. Well, that'll work out perfect because I have Garrett helping me with some stuff tomorrow. And I should be pretty much freed up after that. Because I have all those tickets created for all the bug tickets. it's just a pain in the ass between phone calls trying to like start making bug tickets so I told Garrett I got like three or four of them done today I was like yeah Garrett I might need your help just documenting these but like the title is clear as it gets like I have the template in there it's just a matter of filling it out so he's we're going to divvy the rest of them up so that way I can send all those up tomorrow not. Okay. Yeah, no, no, that's good. And, like, none of them are super urgent anyway, so they've been issues for forever, but I don't think it's... Yeah, they're just... I would like them fixed eventually. Yeah, well, it was fucking... I'm, like, trying to tell Mac I can't do something in... like the... like the Lucene upgrades and all that, and he's like, you sure? Pretty sure I've showed you how to do this. But I was like, Mac, I know what I can do. It's only how I don't have access. I know how to type refresh or upgrade in a file. I know how to press the up to Lucene button. Right, exactly. I think that that, I can't remember if that button, that stupid button, though, it doesn't. I think it takes them to eight and not nine, which is super annoying. It does. So if we take them to nine, you have to do the up to lucene to eight and then kick off the upgrade, which also does a re-index. Sometimes. That email that I just sent out has the instructions in there for it because I found two different databases. Some of them were older, but one of them just got activated. So I don't know why that happened for that one. I don't have an answer. but then like inconsistent like it wasn't when we first started doing these or first started upgrading people to nine it wasn't automatically re-indexing them it was just upgrading it and then after that it was we also realized if we didn't put aia embeddings before we upgraded it didn't work but like it still wasn't running a re-index so i had to i had to upgrade it first and then go back in and re-index it afterwards to get stupid resumes. But I think Coverstone fixed that, hopefully. But I could do all that other stuff now. Like I could actually upgrade people. So it is letting you... You did get access to it, Coverstone did that? Yeah, it's because the profile path profiles are stored on a different server. They're not on .NET. um oh oh i understand what you're saying that makes sense that makes sense yeah i don't know i just know that i got access to it but i didn't know what the i'm at whatever company now and he's like messaging me on discord asking about He was asking me about the AI stuff today, too. Put in a ticket. He just wants to know how much it'll cost. I'm not doing that. I don't want him to start messaging me this shit. I also left it alone for two days on purpose, so that he doesn't do that in the future. But I don't know. I think that's it. I think that's all I know. Yeah. I don't think it'll be bad while I'm gone. But it'll be relatively easy. But I'm hoping, because it hasn't really gotten much busier yet, but I think it probably will soon-ish. And Jason... Yeah, Jason updated the... Hopefully. I don't know if it's done or not yet, but he did the call queue thing for next week. Last week, I forgot he was gone. The ring central call queue thing. Oh, is he the one that was putting that together? Yeah, but then I forgot. He was gone since he was on vacation, so then it didn't get done last week. I don't know if that one's accurate or not, but he's going to update that. You guys at least have it for next week. I got nothing going on next week so far. Hopefully it stays that way. that way I actually have time to deal with shit if something pops off right like I said I typically there's nothing like from a Friday to a Thursday that I think is gonna be like or yeah be handled right now or it's the end of the world do you like how I made that server thing happen quick this time the server thing? Oh, yeah. With higher easy? I was like, here's all the information it's the same server as last time. Yeah. This is like, I, well, I figured it was going to happen again because they didn't change anything. But I don't know what's happening with that, actually. Jake's on vacation this week. So. Yes. I'll fix it when he comes back. I would assume they're still shut off. Yeah. But cool. That's all I needed. If anything else comes up, let me know. Like I said, I'll be on for half the day tomorrow. Okay. Hey, you know me. I just do what you tell me. Sounds good. Thanks, Tyler. I appreciate it. All right. Talk to you later. Bye.",

anyone else and Bill won't end up doing them.\n\n7\n00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:32,724\nso I'll talk about it at the support meeting tomorrow but basically if they have\n\n8\n00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:39,368\nissues they can just take it to you and then if it's like fuck you guys this is how\n\n9\n00:00:39,508 --> 00:00:45,271\nwe do it yeah I mean if so if it's not urgent and you don't know what to do with it\n\n10\n00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:48,894\nthey can wait until I get back then let me know if it is urgent,\n\n11\n00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:50,014\nthere's a couple different
