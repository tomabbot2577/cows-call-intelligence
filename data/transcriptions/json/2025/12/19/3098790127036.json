The owner of the company that I have said he had a couple of licenses. I'm trying to log on to it. He can't find his info. I'm trying to see what you can do to help me out and to log in. Sure. What's your name and what company are you with? I'm with Bowman Recruiting, B-O-W-M-A-N Recruiting. Okay. And my name is Eric Jensen. His name is Charles Bowman. Okay, gotcha. So are you trying to log in on the browser to PCR, or are you trying to log in on Outlook? Both. Okay. Okay. So which one is giving you the issue saying that you don't have a license? I don't have the username and password is what I'm saying. Oh, you don't have it. Okay. Yeah. He just said to give them a call. He works another job and I'm managing the business. So I don't know. Gotcha. So he wanted me to call. No problem. So I don't have access to any user passwords, but I can give you your username if that helps. Sure. What is it? Log in Bowman Recruiting. I have a username called admin, and I have a username CBowman82. What is it, Bowman82? What was it? CBowman82 would be a username. E-Bellman 82. Yeah, so it sounds like Charles, yeah, that's his username. So he set the passwords for that so he would know what those are, but we don't have access to passwords. Okay, so I've got to get it from him is what you're saying? Yeah. But, yeah, if you do have anything pop up that says, like, license expired or whatever, just let us know. We can reset things and make that pop-up go away for sure. Okay, thanks. I'll give you a call back if I need anything. All right. Sounds good. Have a good one.",
