So I'm a PCR user, and for some reason, PCR capture, we had some problems with it yesterday. And, well, actually, we logged into PCR, and Robin helped me get that set up. but after we did that, now it seems like whenever I'm capturing a profile on LinkedIn, the PCR capture, it's not attaching the company to the download. Yeah, so click your capture extension up in the top of your screen. Yep. And you'll want to turn off the toggle that says capture to default company. ah okay and you'll just want to refresh your LinkedIn page okay you just see if Let me just try this again while I have it here. Okay. All right. That was easy enough. All right. That was a pop flyer grounder. Thank you. Hey, we'll take it. Okay. Have a good day. You too.",
