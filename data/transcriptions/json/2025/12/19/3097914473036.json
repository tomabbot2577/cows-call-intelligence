    "text": "Hello? Hi, Hugh. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I had a question about you. Hi, how are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm sorry, I didn't hear your first name again. Robin Mantoni. Okay. The question I had was, you know, I go on to pay when you send me the email. Okay. But the company continues to demand me leave my payment information in their system, and I will not do that. I cannot do that, and it's simply because my bank won't pay it. I have been hacked. Since my wife was killed, I've been hacked. Four years after she died, she spent $800,000. so I had to file a bankruptcy for her four years after she died so the bank has tightened me down okay I have that turned off for you now so it won't require that you save it okay because my bank when I try and pay it electronically they send you an invitation you have to accept that invitation and that's not happened so they're going to send you a check now I will go in there and see if I can terminate that check process because it's really delayed like September 30th. They won't even send it until September 30th. So I'll try and terminate that if I can go back on that. Go back in here. Yeah, I would probably make sure you did. Yeah, probably go. If you were in the invoice, go out and go back in. I have it turned off now. View pay. Okay. Perfect. If I could keep that, then I can make these payments and make it quicker. And yeah, I would really appreciate that. Because again, my bank, like recurring, they will not do it. Okay. All right. Yeah, the auto pay was turned off from what I saw. But the required stored card was not. They won't do that. My bank will – I mean, I had another one today. Okay. As a matter of fact, my water bill was exactly – Yeah, it should have been for a car but not require auto pay. Now I have both of those off, though. Yeah, that's worked because, like I said, my bank just won't pay it. I get these notices on my phone all the time. So I have to go back in and try and make another payment. Call the bank and let them know that's a valid debit. You've got to let it go through. So it's just a pain in the rear end because they've had to pay so much. I get hacked, and I change banks and change cards. I had to reincorporate into the corporation, everything, and it's just – the banker finally told me, he said, Hugh, if they've got your information, they've got your information. He doesn't – he stopped changing banks and accounts. He's not doing anything. They've got you. He got me through her. so I appreciate that now I can pay it okay I'll see if I can cancel the B of A thing and I'll pay you today okay sounds good thank you very much I appreciate it you're welcome have a good week bye",

Sequence.\n\n4\n00:00:06,343 --> 00:00:06,915\nI had a question about you.\n\n5\n00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:07,719\nHi, how are you doing?\n\n6\n00:00:08,062 --> 00:00:08,292\nI'm good.\n\n7\n00:00:08,927 --> 00:00:09,477\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:10,480\nI'm good.\n\n9\n00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,300\nI'm sorry, I didn't hear your first name again.\n\n10\n00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:12,947\nRobin Mantoni.\n\n11\n00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:14,385\nOkay.\n\n12\n00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,897\nThe question I had was, you know, I go on to pay when you send me the email.\n\n13\n00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:22,365\nOkay.\n\n14\n00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,067\nBut the company continues to demand me leave my payment information in their\n\n15\n00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:28,051\nsystem, and I will not do that.\n\n16\n00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,112\nI cannot do that, and it's simply because my bank won't pay it.\n\n17\n00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,469\nI have been hacked.\n\n18\n00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:42,631\nSince my wife was killed, I've been hacked.\n\n19\n00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,714\nFour years after she died, she spent $800,000.\n\n20\n00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,982\nso I had to file a bankruptcy for her four years after she died so the bank has\n\n21\n00:00:52,002 --> 00:01:01,147\ntightened me down okay I have that turned off for you now so it won't require that\n\n22\n00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:06,711\nyou save it okay because my bank when I try and pay it electronically they send you\n\n23\n00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:12,014\nan invitation you have to accept that invitation and that's not happened so they're\n\n24\n00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:16,076\ngoing to send you a check now I will go in there and see if I can terminate that\n\n25\n00:01:16,096 --> 00:01:18,557\ncheck process because it's really delayed like September 30th.\n\n26\n00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,379\nThey won't even send it until September 30th.\n\n27\n00:01:27,461 --> 00:01:30,176\nSo I'll try and terminate that if I can go back on that.\n\n28\n00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:32,748\nGo back in here.\n\n29\n00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,859\nYeah, I would probably make sure you did.\n\n30\n00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:40,019\nYeah, probably go.\n\n31\n00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:42,957\nIf you were in the invoice, go out and go back in.\n\n32\n00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,680\nI have it turned off now.\n\n33\n00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:45,111\nView pay.\n\n34\n00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:49,940\nOkay.\n\n35\n00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,980\nPerfect.\n\n36\n00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,380\nIf I could keep that, then I can make these payments and make it quicker.\n\n37\n00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,440\nAnd yeah, I would really appreciate that.\n\n38\n00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,220\nBecause again, my bank, like recurring, they will not do it.\n\n39\n00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,000\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,260\nAll right.\n\n41\n00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,780\nYeah, the auto pay was turned off from what I saw.\n\n42\n00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,440\nBut the required stored card was not.\n\n43\n00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,640\nThey won't do that.\n\n44\n00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,600\nMy bank will – I mean, I had another one today.\n\n45\n00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:21,860\nOkay.\n\n46\n00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,925\nAs a matter of fact,\n\n47\n00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,920\nmy water bill was exactly – Yeah,\n\n48\n00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,340\nit should have been for a car but not require auto pay.\n\n49\n00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,660\nNow I have both of those off, though.\n\n50\n00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,600\nYeah, that's worked because, like I said, my bank just won't pay it.\n\n51\n00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,300\nI get these notices on my phone all the time.\n\n52\n00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,900\nSo I have to go back in and try and make another payment.\n\n53\n00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560\nCall the bank and let them know that's a valid debit.\n\n54\n00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,880\nYou've got to let it go through.\n\n55\n00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,560\nSo it's just a pain in the rear end because they've had to pay so much.\n\n56\n00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,880\nI get hacked, and I change banks and change cards.\n\n57\n00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,537\nI had to reincorporate into the corporation,\n\n58\n00:02:56,537 --> 00:02:56,830\neverything,\n\n59\n00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,474\nand it's just – the banker finally told me,\n\n60\n00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:00,062\nhe said,\n\n61\n00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:00,356\nHugh,\n\n62\n00:03:00,356 --> 00:03:01,825\nif they've got your information,\n\n63\n00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:03,000\nthey've got your information.\n\n64\n00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,620\nHe doesn't – he stopped changing banks and accounts.\n\n65\n00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,880\nHe's not doing anything.\n\n66\n00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,640\nThey've got you.\n\n67\n00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,440\nHe got me through her.\n\n68\n00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:15,374\nso I appreciate that now I can pay it okay I'll see if I can cancel the B of A\n\n69\n00:03:15,374 --> 00:03:18,098\nthing and I'll pay you today okay sounds good thank you ",
