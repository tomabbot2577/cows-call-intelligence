And we came across, like, AI stuff. Is that, like, do we have access to that? or so on that splash screen when you first log into peace recruiter there's like more we can read more about it at the bottom of that page is a form that you'd have to um it'd have to be filled out by the contract signer which is daniel eggleston oh yeah if he fills out that form then um we have to basically re-index the database for it to be compatible but then you would have that available to you. Oh, okay. Is it like cost extra or is that just like something that you just have to evaluate and see if it's something that we can have? Yeah, we just have to re-index the database before we can enable it. So that's why it's on the contract signer. Where do I find that? So at the login page where you saw the announcement. Oh, yeah. if you like. Yeah, and it should be at the bottom of that form. Bottom of the form. Where it says Introducing AI Candidate Match? Yeah. And then you click More? Yep. And then it's all the way, oh, like this, how to get it, and then you put a name, email, and then link? Yeah. Okay. All right. And Dan has to do that, right? Right. That'll need to come from him since he's the contract signer. We don't look for any adjustments to people's data bases without their permission. Okay. All right. I'm going to message him just to see if we can get this going because I didn't know that we had access to this. Is this new, like as of today? Yep. When will this come out? Okay. Yep, this is a new feature. All right. Sounds good. All right. Thanks, Robin. You're welcome. Have a good week. You too. Thanks. All right, thanks. Bye. Bye-bye.",
