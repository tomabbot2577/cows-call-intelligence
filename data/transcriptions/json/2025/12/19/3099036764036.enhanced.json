    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, good morning, Tyler. This is Sonia Ippoliti calling from Princeton Legal Search Group. How are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. I have a question for you about automations and as they apply to a roll-up. So I have team members. They're working on roll-ups. They're using stages. and what I would like to have happen is when they log a particular stage, which logs an activity, I want that to trigger an email to go out. So I went into automations. I got my form letter. I went to create an automation that I could then, you know, attach to the roll-up stages global settings. and I'm not sure I'm understanding. So when I created the automation, let me just go to it. You know, I want the email to go to the record, to the name on the record. And the only option I was given that somewhat resembled that was like record email. Correct. Yeah. So what is record email? That would be the primary email address on the record. So whatever's in the email address field. Got it. Got it. So. Yeah, so you have yours labeled. It looks like personal email. Yeah. Yeah. So that's the predefined email address field that we'll go to. Yours is just labeled personal email. Got it. Got it. I see. So, yeah, so we differentiate. Yeah, so we differentiate because we also use this as like a CRM. So we use the primary email field. We label it personal email and we use it for candidates. and then we have a custom email field for our business development purpose like purposes for client contacts and so it we would not be able to use that custom field for this automation correct the automations can only run off the roll-up list automations can only roll run off of predefined fields got it so So what I could do, however, is I could make that primary email field one that is used for either, quote unquote, our candidates or clients. And just if it was for a candidate, we would need to put in a personal email. If it was for a client, we would need to put in a work email. Correct. Yeah, you could do it that way. And then I could run it that way. Got it. Got it. Okay. I understand. That's super, super helpful. And then quick question for you. When I'm reviewing a list of names on a roll-up, I seem to remember there was a setting you can activate to enable like inline editing of the record, like an email address or something like that. Am I hallucinating or is that actually something that I remembered somewhere? Um, I have never seen it. Huh. So you have to go through the actual edit field of the name record? Yeah. Yeah, the only field that we've had that you can, like, type into from there is we had a, like, quick comments field. Yeah. Yeah, that I am familiar, like in the stages, yeah. Got it. Okay, so that seems to be a non-go. And while we're speaking of quick comments, is that something that is tax searchable or no? No, it's only visible within that specific role. Yeah. Okay, good to know. Okay. And then my final question for you, thank you, I'm all over the place, but these are like questions I've been accumulating. is a scenario where, for example, a recruiter has the ability to make phone calls from more than one line. Okay. So they have maybe three different lines. How does that impact the integration with RingCentral and PC Recruiter? Because all of our recruiters do have RingCentral integration. So you can only integrate one line per user. Got it. Got it. And if, so if we, so if they change the line, then I have to go into the settings and update their phone number, the number that they're using. Is that correct? Yes. So when you set up the RingCentral integration, even if you have access to other lines, in RingCentral there's a primary phone number that's assigned to you. That's the one that needs to be connected in PC Recruiter, otherwise it won't log properly. Got it. So if they have, so if we have a primary number listed in PC Recruiter, let's say ending in one, okay, and the recruiter has three numbers, one ends in one, one ends in two, one ends in three. If they're making calls off of their number ending in two, that will not be reflected in PC Recruiter? Correct. Unless it all syncs to the same call log for phone number one. But if RingCentral keeps it as separate logs, only the primary one that's connected will sync. Okay. I'm processing that. I'm just trying to figure out how I can find out if it's syncing to the same log. So in the RingCentral Admin Center, you can pull call logs. ah okay and as long as all like as long as um calls made from any of their lines are appearing there then if they're appearing under the same log like so like let's say you have to search separately for one two and three yeah no so i would do like a search for the name the user extension, and then it'll show me all of their calls made on any of their lines, because those lines are actually attributed to them. Yeah. So each, it's not separate logs? No, no. So let's say I call up the call log yesterday for one of my recruiters and she has, let's say, two different numbers that she can use to make calls from, her call log will show me the from number and the to number and the time and the date and yada, yada, yada. Okay. So if May, I can double check for you and get back to you. Yeah. Can you double? Yeah. I have to figure out how they're sending the API call over to us. like yeah only looks at the number that's set in the PC recruiter configuration yeah just goes based on like login account yeah but I could figure that one out for you yeah that would be really helpful to know because we do on occasion like on the fly give recruiters the ability to use like a different number and I just need to know what I need to do on my end to ensure that the calls they're making are tracking to PC Recruiter. Yeah, let me ask about that one for you and then I can send you an email. Okay, thank you, Tyler. I really appreciate it. Really, really appreciate it. Yeah, not a problem. Okay, all right. Thanks so much. Have a great day. I look forward to hearing from you. It's not a rush. So, you know, next couple of days is fine. Okay, perfect. All right. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. Thanks. Bye-bye.",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:05,341 --> 00:00:06,173\nHi, good morning, Tyler.\n\n5\n00:00:06,821 --> 00:00:10,000\nThis is Sonia Ippoliti calling from Princeton Legal Search Group.\n\n6\n00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:11,379\nHow are you doing today?\n\n7\n00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:11,736\nGood.\n\n8\n00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,048\nHow are you?\n\n9\n00:00:13,286 --> 00:00:13,900\nI'm doing well.\n\n10\n00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:16,728\nI have a question for you about automations and as they apply to a roll-up.\n\n11\n00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,997\nSo I have team members.\n\n12\n00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,558\nThey're working on roll-ups.\n\n13\n00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,454\nThey're using stages.\n\n14\n00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:30,305\nand what I would like to have happen is when they log a particular stage,\n\n15\n00:00:30,346 --> 00:00:31,608\nwhich logs an activity,\n\n16\n00:00:31,668 --> 00:00:33,150\nI want that to trigger an email to go out.\n\n17\n00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,588\nSo I went into automations.\n\n18\n00:00:44,063 --> 00:00:44,818\nI got my form letter.\n\n19\n00:00:46,563 --> 00:00:48,127\nI went to create an automation that I could then,\n\n20\n00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:50,854\nyou know,\n\n21\n00:00:50,874 --> 00:00:53,200\nattach to the roll-up stages global settings.\n\n22\n00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,565\nand I'm not sure I'm understanding.\n\n23\n00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:03,279\nSo when I created the automation, let me just go to it.\n\n24\n00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:07,774\nYou know, I want the email to go to the record, to the name on the record.\n\n25\n00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,412\nAnd the only option I was given that somewhat resembled that was like record email.\n\n26\n00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:19,568\nCorrect.\n\n27\n00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:21,037\nYeah.\n\n28\n00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,293\nSo what is record email?\n\n29\n00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:25,993\nThat would be the primary email address on the record.\n\n30\n00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:30,018\nSo whatever's in the email address field.\n\n31\n00:01:32,863 --> 00:01:33,128\nGot it.\n\n32\n00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:34,932\nGot it.\n\n33\n00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:36,381\nSo.\n\n34\n00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:46,009\nYeah, so you have yours labeled.\n\n35\n00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,097\nIt looks like personal email.\n\n36\n00:01:50,451 --> 00:01:50,658\nYeah.\n\n37\n00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,049\nYeah.\n\n38\n00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,960\nSo that's the predefined email address field that we'll go to.\n\n39\n00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:57,679\nYours is just labeled personal email.\n\n40\n00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:01,440\nGot it.\n\n41\n00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:01,975\nGot it.\n\n42\n00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:03,900\nI see.\n\n43\n00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,067\nSo, yeah, so we differentiate.\n\n44\n00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:10,856\nYeah, so we differentiate because we also use this as like a CRM.\n\n45\n00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,259\nSo we use the primary email field.\n\n46\n00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,955\nWe label it personal email and we use it for candidates.\n\n47\n00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,622\nand then we have a custom email field for our business development purpose like\n\n48\n00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:27,564\npurposes for client contacts and so it we would not be able to use that custom\n\n49\n00:02:27,584 --> 00:02:31,546\nfield for this automation correct the automations can only run off the roll-up list\n\n50\n00:02:31,606 --> 00:02:38,990\nautomations can only roll run off of predefined fields got it so So what I could\n\n51\n00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,490\ndo, however,\n\n52\n00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,312\nis I could make that primary email field one that is used for either,\n\n53\n00:02:43,592 --> 00:02:44,272\nquote unquote,\n\n54\n00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,613\nour candidates or clients.\n\n55\n00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:04,018\nAnd just if it was for a candidate, we would need to put in a personal email.\n\n56\n00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:06,677\nIf it was for a client, we would need to put in a work email.\n\n57\n00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,398\nCorrect.\n\n58\n00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,020\nYeah, you could do it that way.\n\n59\n00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:11,920\nAnd then I could run it that way.\n\n60\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:12,585\nGot it.\n\n61\n00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,169\nGot it.\n\n62\n00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,567\nOkay.\n\n63\n00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:15,216\nI understand.\n\n64\n00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:16,987\nThat's super, super helpful.\n\n65\n00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:20,771\nAnd then quick question for you.\n\n66\n00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,844\nWhen I'm reviewing a list of names on a roll-up,\n\n67\n00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:28,208\nI seem to remember there was a setting you can activate to enable like inline\n\n68\n00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,751\nediting of the record,\n\n69\n00:03:29,851 --> 00:03:33,195\nlike an email address or something like that.\n\n70\n00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,290\nAm I hallucinating or is that actually something that I remembered somewhere?\n\n71\n00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:45,157\nUm, I have never seen it.\n\n72\n00:03:46,705 --> 00:03:46,769\nHuh.\n\n73\n00:03:47,62",
