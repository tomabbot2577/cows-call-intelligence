    "text": "Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. It's where? Oh, yeah. And it's one of these run as many laps as you can, I think. I don't know. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Welcome. Okay. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Do you hear me? Yeah. Hey, Jim. How's it going? Not bad. Not bad. How are you? Doing all right, man. It's kind of a weird week. we had a big work event on Friday and someone got hit by a car and died. Oh no. Yeah. So it's a, sorry to bring that up. I've got a little weird headspace here today. For sure. That certainly is. I hate to see that. Yeah. So that's, you know, with that, yeah, it's, I've never had to deal with anything like this before. So we're all kind of going through it together, but I do appreciate you. Yeah. You hopping on with me today, man. I'm still excited to talk to you. This is a big move for us. We are, just to kind of jump in, sorry, like I said, my head's all over the place here, but not sure if you've done any research on ARCO, but we are a pretty large general contractor. We've got north of like 25 recruiters internally. And I think the first thing I want to just explain to you is we very much act like an agency when it comes to recruiting in a way that we have a lot of businesses within ARCO that are all connected, but they operate independently. So we might treat one business and have certain workflows in the system. I guess what we're looking to do is be able to treat one business with certain workflows and another business with others. So we're currently on ISIMs right now, if you're familiar with them. Our contract's up with September of next year. It's like 99.9% looking like we're going to move away from them. So we are in the process of vetting other ATSs. This is probably our ninth call, Jim, and me and my colleague are going through this process. I think what we're trying to do is by the end of this month, which is obviously just a short time from now, identify maybe those top three to five platforms that we want to kind of take that next step with as far as, you know, full demos with the rest of our team in the hopes of by the end of this year choosing who we're going to move forward with for implementation next year. Perfect. Okay. Absolutely. That makes sense. Yeah. So I think, I mean, for today, I'll kind of flip it back to you, man, and just hoping to see the platform, ask some questions. I think should this go well and you feel you can service what we're looking for and we like you, there will probably be another demo request I'd ask from you. Talk with my partner and maybe have a bit of a deeper dive. But I'll flip it over to you, man. Perfect, perfect. And any specific functions or features that are half to halves, just so I can kind of make sure to key in on those. So for us, the problem we're running into with ISIMs right now, so custom ability is big, right? Kind of like I talked about. So the ability to have like different workflows for different businesses all within the same parent company are pretty important to us. You know, one of our divisions is going to be like multifamily housing, right? The group that builds apartment complexes. Well, their hiring process might be different than our entertainment team that they hire the same types of people. They hire the same skill sets, but they operate in kind of different capacities, if that makes sense. So the ability to customize workflows for each of those businesses is important. I think for us, integration is big, obviously. I think most platforms nowadays are, you can integrate with a lot. We utilize UKG as one of our HR platforms, or I don't know what the title is of that platform, but it is UKG, so having some open integration would be helpful. For us, the other issue we're running into right now is, like, pipelining candidates. So the folks that we are not interested in, or, like, maybe they're not interested in us, or now is not the right time, we don't really have an ability to put them on some sort of, you know, email campaign or follow-up system that is automatic. and we also don't have the ability to create like a task list where you would kind of log in and say hey these are the things that I scheduled out for myself today a lot of what we're doing now is just done via Outlook us manually creating events within our Outlook calendar and not necessarily being able to tie tasks or next steps to a candidate within the system okay excellent excellent yeah we can handle all of that certainly and it kind of makes sense how you said you recruit very much like an agency you're treating each of these sub sub organizations like their own unique company we can do that we yeah so we can create different pipelines so you could when you put in a job based on what company it's for you can pick what pipeline it's going to be you can have as many of those as you wish so we can certainly handle that so let me share my screen to kind of show you around here i'm going to show you here so let me know when you see my sign in screen you should be looking at that momentarily yep uh It's starting to change. Still black. Here we go. I got it now. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and get myself logged into PC Recruiter. So we are all cloud-based, as most of these products are. So it's going to be something that you could run on a PC or a Mac. There's a mobile app. You can access it from anywhere. It's all cloud-based. And each user is going to have their own unique username and ID. So I'm going to go ahead and get logged in as admin. And once I am, what's nice about that is anything that happens in the system, I'll tag back to your username. So there's going to be reporting. there's going to be metrics, there's going to be activities, anything you do, tag your username. So you're going to see who else is working with an individual, whether it's a candidate, whether it's a position, whatever it might be. So essentially, you're going to have a menu bar down the left-hand side of the screen, and that's going to get you to our primary elements here. The companies, you would kind of set it up like a recruiting agency. You'd put in each of your business units as their own specific company. You're obviously not going to have as many as a general recruiter would, but you're going to have separate companies there. And then you can link the positions to those various different companies. So that's going to give you the ability to go to your position, their companies names, of course. And within each company, within each company, can we create certain workflows for that? Like, you know, one company might have three interview categories that we're going to push a candidate through, whereas another might just have two. Is that customizable like that? Yeah. Let me show you one of those pipelines. I'll show you an example and then show you some different things you can do. So I'm going to hop into one of my positions. So if I go into here, positions, I'm going to go to this radiological control tech, just open up the position screen. The pipeline is going to be your workflow. So that pipeline is going to give you the capability to track all of your different steps. And you'll see this one has a large number of stages. Your pipelines can have up to 18 steps. You call them whatever you like. You name them, you pick what order they're in, you pick what color they are. So I'm going to be able to see this one has a number of different steps. so and this is like I'm sorry to cut you off I'm going to have a lot of questions I'm sorry Jim so if I created this for a company any recruiter that's assigned to that company this is how it would look right you don't have to create it personally for each recruiter create it one time and then the only thing when any job is entered into the system whoever's doing that they're going to the very first thing they're asked to pick is which pipeline do you want to go with you would name them and they just pick it out of that list there and these are drag and drops Yes, yeah, just simple drag. Awesome, awesome, awesome. So as you do that, it creates a searchable, trackable, reportable event in there. And if I go into – I want to go to my pipeline stages. Let's see, pipeline setup. So if I go into my pipeline setup, this is where I'm able to build my different templates. I can click through each one. Maybe some of them have a different number of steps. Maybe some of them have different colors. You'll see here it's like shortlist, general screen. I've got a few steps here. So you're able to really set it up any way you'd like and you can have as many as you want. And when you set them up, again, here's where you pick whatever color, you give it a title. You can even set up various different automations. So you can pop it up to put a little note in there. So like if it was an applicant, like after the face-to-face interview, if we need them to fill out an application, it could pop up saying send the application to them. Pop up a little reminder or maybe it pops up a screen that you have to write in a few notes or anything like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. plans. Yeah. So you can kind of add automations on there, send things, push notifications, all sorts of different things. So yeah, that's going to be key. So you have that ability to every position you put in, pick whatever pipeline it's going to be. So you can set that up. So once you create them once, everybody accesses them and that's the way to go. So that's going to be an easy way of doing that. So each one of your positions, of course, you're going to have those pipelines, simple drag and drop. What's cool about that is you can also track out a process. So maybe Maybe if I had Susan was out of process, I can right click, I can move her out of process. You have up to 10 different categories as to why they were out of process. I can put that she turned us down maybe. That pulls her out of the primary consideration but keeps her down in this out of process area. It's also going to note that in her record. So if I happen to look at Susan Peter's record, I'm going to see that drag and drop that I did. It's going to not only create an activity showing there's where she was moved out of process and why and when and by who. So I'm going to see that's an activity. that's also going to show up in her individual interview history showing that she turned us down for that job and any other job she had ever been linked to that's going to show up right there as well on her record so so flexible logically then if i if i created uh out of process so the max amount of out of process tags we could have is 10 i think it's 10 i think 10 categories okay okay so if one of those out of process categories was like i could put you know she's not a fit now but we want to keep in touch, could I add an action that puts her on like an automatic email campaign that will send her an email once a quarter? You might be able to do that. Let's look at out of process. I think you can set up some, and I don't remember where to go to set up the out of process categories, but I think you can set up different. Well, let's see, where's that at there? It's on the bottoms of those. Oh, yeah. Let's add a little bit. So, yeah. So this, you could put her on a specific roll-up list or pop up a window to write an activity. That's a nice one because if you move them to a certain thing, maybe it pops up a window to write an activity, whatever that might be. Okay. Yeah, yeah. I like that. So that's certainly helpful there. So a lot of automations in the system. And another tool that I think you might find useful, we also have roll-up lists in PC Recruiter. that's going to be a nice area that you can kind of keep a passive set of candidates so that maybe you even set up an automation when you move her out of process because she was unqualified maybe it adds her to a roll-up list your roll-up list is going to be essentially a group of records in the system and it could be anything like I've got a manager candidates I've got 80 panelists sales and marketing people people that know C++ and VB whatever it might be so you can keep these lists you can keep kind of lukewarm lists of people you've talked with passive candidates people you just keep it in touch with cool thing about the roll-up is if you open up the roll-up list you're going to be able to look at that entire list so you could go through opening any of the records individually we also have email campaign functionality so you could instantly just select them all send out a personalized email to everyone there's reporting that will track clicks opens unsubscribe supplies you have the other also we have a sequencing piece so you could even build a sequence that maybe Maybe it sends an email to these people and then if they don't apply within one day or six days or whatever, it'll send them another. Or if they do reply, maybe it adds them to your call list on a task list there. So we have a full sequencing piece in PCRecruiter 2 that you can actually build custom sequences that will run within the system. And these could be email only or they could include some other things like I've got like a candidate engagement sequence here that maybe the first thing is an email sent. And if they open the email, it's going to jump them to step three. That's going to add my phone call list. And I have a task list that now is going to have a list of everyone that opened my email reminding me to give them a call. Or if no interaction occurs in five days, continue to the next step, it'll send them a second email. So you can actually build these sequences in here like drip campaigns. And that's going to work email only. Or if you had like here I have a to-do list right here of 13 calls. These are people that opened my email and I said I want to know that. I want to give them a call I can click into each person I have a synopsis of their fields a little history of their activity I could put in a script too if you want to throw a script in there what I'm calling about because it's a specific sequence if you have ring central you can even click and dial right out of the system there so our ring central integration allows you to click the dial and then you just mark whatever happened that'll go ahead and move them to the next step whatever you identified that is going to be and it'll record an activity as well so the activities are all recorded in there as to. And then do the notes just stay in that notes tab or do they pop off to the right there once you've created a note? Like is the screen to the right where it says task call candidate, is that always just tasks? Or like if I want to review previous notes, they'll just be in the notes section down there? They're going to be down in the activity section down below. Yeah. So I can actually get the candidate record right from there. Activities is going to be essentially a journal of everything you've done. This is showing just a lot of interviews this person's had. But if I looked at a different candidate, so I'm just going to go to someone who's got a little bit beefier of a record. So if I look at Terry Stidham here, if I look at his record and I can full screen it here, you can design this initial workspace however you want. Of course. You can put the resume right there. You can put the activities wherever. But if you want to go to activities, I can just go right into the activities in the menu bar and I'm going to see everything that has happened there. Call on Monday, whatever it might be. So I can see everything that has happened. If you click notes, notes next door, that'll be like if I take my phone screen and type my notes in there and then I'll have, all right, yeah, yeah, perfect. Well, yeah, this is going to be searchable data, so you can put in anything here you might want to be searchable. You can put pages of data in here. This is easily searchable along with all the resumes. Another little trick we have is profiles. You can actually build a profile in PC Recruiter that you could submit, and let's see where it is in here. So I can submit a profile. You can actually put in, like, let's say, a little, so you can put in like a data sheet or something here. And if I open this up, it's going to open up a questionnaire that you designed. Maybe it's a phone screen and you ask them a few questions, check their checkboxes, fill out what they say. As soon as you hit save, that's going to be a searchable attachment. So you're going to have a searchable attachment of all of these different things that you might've filled out. A lot of these are archive word resumes, but here are the A1 phone call questions. That is one that I filled out when I spoke last. I can view and I can see that I just asked him question filled up the answer that's all searchable data so that's one of the issues one of the issues we run into now is like there's just so many people have created so many things that it's like it's the where do you put stuff so if we create these things can we create can we set it to where only the admins creating certain things and then users can't or is it open to everybody? Either way. So you can set that up. A lot of people will have only an admin, but the nice thing about PCV is you could have two admins. So maybe if you have two people that are the point individuals, they're the only ones that can go in and create, change, affect, customize, anything like that. And is that the max admins you could have is two? Oh no, you can have as many as you want. You could have everybody. Or one person. So that's up to you. Yep, yep. Perfect. And then the record. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Oh, no, I like it. I like it. Sorry. What is your integration with, like, LinkedIn or adding profiles? Can you show me what that looks like, like, when you're creating a candidate? Sure, sure. So we actually have integrations with a number of different sites, LinkedIn included. So if I go up here, this capture piece, this is an app that we have. It's included in every version of PC Recruiter. It's going to work with all these different four versions of PC Recruiter, or LinkedIn, rather. LinkedIn Recruiter, LinkedIn Recruiter by Sales. Also, it works with if you have accounts with like Indeed, CareerBuilder, various versions of ZoomInfo, Facebook, Bing, Monster, and a few others. Any of those are going to be able to be imported. So you're going to be able to pull records in just if you happen to be looking at LinkedIn. So if I'm at LinkedIn and I want to get somebody in here, and I'm just going to just get a list of people here at random. So if I wanted to pull in any of these individuals, all I do is go look at the record. As soon as I look at any record on LinkedIn or any of those other sites, you're going to have a click-to-add button that's going to show up on the far right of the screen. That's our PC Recruiter Capture app. And when you click that, what it's going to do, it's going to pull the information it sees. It's going to show that it'll bring in – it'll detect dupes if they're already in the system. It'll give you the option to update a dupe. You can pick what information you want, whether you want to put what it found today on LinkedIn or what you had in PC Recruiter. You can toggle between. And if we have Zoom info, will it automatically populate like their cell phones and stuff if it's in there? Not automatically, but every record is going to have a little button that says Enrich via Zoom info. It'll go out and then do it that way. So we try not to overwrite information because it might – but you can easily do that. So you can look here. Yeah, so it's going to bring in his name, his photo, his title, sometimes email and phone. If you're a first degree, that always comes in, or if they make it public. but in Bernard's case he didn't and I'm not first researching but you're also going to have location that'll almost always pull in here you could even add a searchable note if you wanted as you build the record maybe where you found him maybe you were referred maybe he's a great C++ guy whatever it might be you can add them to one of your roll-up lists that might instantly kick off a sequence so you might have a sequence running for new people that you're pulling in you could even put them into a position pipeline right now so a lot of things to be done there automatically and If I hit save, just that easily, I've created that record. Now, I don't have it turned on, but there's a little thing that will pop up that even gives you the ability to click into the record that you just created. But I like to go, if I go in, I can look at new names today just as easy on my dashboard. There's Bernard right here. So you can see the record I just built. I've got basic information. One-click access to his LinkedIn page. It's going to, of course, time, date, username, stamp. It logs an activity that you added the name and added a profile. my favorite part of this under attachments you're now going to have a copy of his LinkedIn profile that you can view and that's searchable data too so you're able to pull that information all in I kind of start a record right off of there and then we also have parsing so there's a ability to parse in resumes individually in bulk drag and drop so you can work with that too so there's a parser up here if you needed to drag some files there or maybe I wanted to add a name I could even manually add it I could upload an additional attachment link that attachment to the record I'm in the process of adding so it's a pretty beefy data edition feature here and we even have if you have a spreadsheet of data you can import an entire spreadsheet and map the data into PCRecruiter that way too so few different ways to get data in the system yeah if you if you wanted it there's even the ability to post jobs to your website your company website no matter what it looks like when a job is put into PC Recruiter, you can set it up so that that will automatically be displayed on your website. Then candidates can apply online. Not only can they apply online, but you could also allow them to just submit information in general through a link at the top of the screen. Maybe it says, hey, don't see something you like, just click here to submit your information in general. So you can work with that. Okay. What is, do you guys customize with, like, we have a company called Busy for our, like, job boards. so I'd like it has kind of a customized look to our like job applications if you go to our comari calm I can show you what I mean and let's see here if you just go to join our team professional talent And then where that should be somewhere here, I should know this. Back at the top. Sorry, I should. Oh, no worries. Let's see. Very tough. I'll see all of these. I missed it there. Yep. So this is what like our website looks like. But then if you click just any of these jobs, like traveling mobile or just click the job itself, it'll take you to this like busy page that you can see kind of does that reset where it looks like this. So this is like a third party that we've used to make our jobs look a little bit better on the job board itself. If you click like view summary, it pulls up the actual simple job. You know, if you get the summary and if you scroll down, it's more customized. It's supposed to be more attractive to candidates. I don't know if it actually works, but if you click out this and then scroll down, it's like a little bit more of a picturized job description, if you see. I don't know. This is pretty specific. So this is like a third party we're using to make this look this way I don't know if you guys have integration into something like that or if your platform can do something like this oh I'll show my web guy we might be able to do something like this or we might even be able to push kind of plug PC recruiter into this portion and that's what I'm saying either I'm okay with yeah because ours you're able to pick one of these various different templates so whether you want your jobs listed in lists format maybe you want to put a little more information whatever and then when the job is clicked you're going to be able to see details pulled directly out of the system a nice formatted job description and this could embed into any site so maybe this could embed into that site certainly we do it all yeah yeah that's just not what we have to look into and then there's a application yeah we're not dead set on continuing to use busy it's not like a must-have but if you guys have like a way to integrate to it certainly makes our job a little bit easier okay and what's that called busy busy uh v-i-z-i v-i-z-i let me just double check that it's not some other busy recruiter it's called busy recruiter one word I'll mention it to my web guy he might even run into it the past but we can embed into any site so it shouldn't be a problem to do that yeah I guess that we're not like dead set on using them it's just if not we want to see some sort of customizable option from whatever platform we do use so we do have that customizable option but it likely could go into busy as well sure Sure. Yeah. So you're going to have a lot of different things you could do. Let's see. We talked about multi pipelines. That was key. Roll up lists, the ability to group and track your passive candidates, email sequences. We've done that. You're also going to have a task list slash schedule. So the schedule is going to be what I use as my task list. So you're going to be able to have a schedule. It's a calendar. It's going to show everything that's gone on. You can click there. And each of these is linked to a specific record. So when you create that activity, you can just check a box. It'll create a follow-up for you there. But you also have a task list here, too, if you want to go straight up task list. You can link this to a record and do it that way, too. How I personally would do it, how I like to do it, because I actually use PC Recruiter as my CRM. So if I wanted to put a call into Susan Peters, I would be able to just go right here, add activity. So this is going to add one of these activities. So maybe call today, not in. Try your Wednesday, talk about the interview, whatever it might be. So I can jot down all these bits of info. Then I can go ahead and just pick Wednesday right here. and then you can color code it. Maybe it's an interview follow-up. I could even put an activity type here. So maybe no contact me because I'm making a call call, whatever. So you hit save. It's going to do everything. So in addition to logging an activity in there, so the most recent activity is going to show up there. Also, she's going to be on my calendar, so I'm going to have essentially my calendar is my to-do list. And on Wednesday, I'm going to have a link back to her name. Yep. And then I can even jump right to her name right from there. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is what we do. We don't have this in iSIMS. Because we're basically doing all this just to outlook. So it's a pain in the butt to create an event every single time out of the system, add it to your calendar, and then give it to your calendar every day. So this is very much so what we're looking for. yeah yeah and I like my calendar if I look at my calendar here it is and I've got I just make things color-coded yellow items for me are time-specific I've got an alarm on there I've got read as important calls other things so I just kind of throw through a list of everything I've got going on there yeah it works real well so yeah that schedules gonna and everything's linked back to the name so you can go over to the name record pop it in from there and then keyword search too if you need the keyword search I could look up someone by by a skill or by first or last name or anything like that something I also like is the ability to do an all content search so if you just do an all content search oops you gotta pick it in there so if I pick that this is going to unlock a boolean search so maybe I do see people I can hit add can you search for happens oh yeah you get search phone numbers too yeah you just pick up they have to be implemented the same way that it's implemented in the system or can it just you just type the number and it'll find anything that's matching that I think it well let me let me run the search real quick then we'll give it a test see what it does so when I search I'm going to search here I just did a boolean search it's going to pull back the person up top who has the most instances of the most word and you'll see in the query matches column it's you've got it in his attachments his resume his notes his profile all these different places I can even look at the resume it's going to highlight everything that I'm looking for yeah so it's a nice easy way to do that but if I want to do a keyword search and I wanted to kind of just do maybe I'm gonna X that out maybe I want to do phone and work phone equal to I think I can even do like 440 oops 946 I think I could even do like part of one and if I add that yeah it looks like it's pulling up and if you did the 440 without the parentheses would it still kind of pull up the number let's see just a question because we can't we don't have this function on isims either so I think I think that would be what it might be. I think it might be five, two, one. I know that I've got five, two, one, four, and it's kind of pulling any numbers it finds right down there. Yeah. You can see that it's like going. Yeah. But let me add it. It's more so like you get a call back from a random candidate and you're like, I want to figure out who this is before I call them back. You should be able to type in like the number. That's kind of what we're asking for, I guess. So if I had a full number. Yeah. It's actually just doing three, three, nine. Oh, not other. Let me try and work phone. And we can eliminate like we could just have one phone if we wanted in there, right? Yeah. Like the contact field to get to customize what info we need. Okay. Yeah, you can have only one, maybe one work phone and that's the main one. So that's up to you. So if I do 440339, I'm just kind of pulling in. That might not be in there. But if I go 946, yeah, it is going to pull up all the numbers that are a match right there. So it's going to kind of do a live search down there. You can just pick that one and see who it goes to. search and it's going to find that's Jane Smith so it is going to do a live search in the bottom awesome yes I see so I then so also I like when you're looking at a record if I wanted to look at her record maybe I have a primary phone field here but if I go to details that's going to be every field I have and I can just actually filter down only my phone fields and see if I have a mobile a home a fax anything else I don't but it's gonna let me keep research or search through my fields there so it's gonna work real well there I'll be honest with you Jim, I like what I see. I don't know if I need to go through too much more of the demo. I have some questions for you if that's okay. Sure, absolutely. First thing, pricing. Just curious how your guys' pricing structure works, if it's per seat, if it's per size of business, if you could break that down for me. I think I heard you mention there's a couple different versions of PC Recruiter as well. Yeah, so the most popular actually, so we actually have two different interfaces actually. This is the more modern interface. Probably the more, this is called PCRM, so this is a more modern interface. This is the more popular one, but there's also PCR9, which is a different interface. That one even has a lower level, but the lower level leaves off email campaigns, sequences, analytics reports. Yeah, we wouldn't want that. We'd want the higher one. So yes, you'd want the higher one. The higher one is just $115 per user per month. That's on a one-year commitment. So $115 per user per month. You can add or drop users at any time. I think when you sign the contract, you're committed to a minimum of half of your original contracted number of users. So you have some leeway in there. So you can add and drop. A lot of ad price. Build monthly. $115, that includes everything we looked at today. There's a one-time setup fee. It would vary. It's usually about $2,000, depending on how much training to include the training. so it's going to be 20 hours we can kind of fine-tune that depending on what we need trainees all included and then an isoms conversion those that's going to run like probably two thousand bucks to to do the isoms conversion if you were looking for roughly 4k between conversion and customization yeah and what is I know it depends on each business and how much is going into it just on average though what is your implementation time look like usually so the conversion is going to take probably about 90 days to get done because it's a custom process. We have a ISIMs to PC Recruiter map, so they'll kind of start with that map, but they'll work with you in your data. Our conversion guy will have a call with you. He'll go maybe pick six or eight records at random to map the fields into the appropriate area. They'll run it, show it to you, walk you through it, let you take a look, maybe make changes. So it goes back and forth like that quite a bit. So that usually takes 90 days to get done. But during that 90 days, you're not paying anything for PC Recruiter, but you are getting some training as you're looking at that. So once the conversion is done in 90 days, They usually try to do the bulk of the training in the first 30 days, so after that. So if it happens that it might get done in 60 days, maybe you could even have training done inside of 90 days. But usually we allow 90 days for the conversion, 30 days after that for most of the training. And the training is customized to you. So it's going to be group training on the phone, but maybe you have admins do the first training because only the people that are going to be admins need to know how to configure things. So a lot of flexibility in that. And they'll kind of go over how you're going to use the software. Pipelines are going to be of great importance. So they'll spend a little extra time on that. And what does support look like from you guys? Support? So you actually have one dedicated trainer. You have that person's direct contact info. You can reach out to them. They're going to do all your trainings. You have me as an account manager. There's also a support line you can dial in. That'll ring the whole team. Anyone who answers can help. There's a chat on our website. So you can do the support chat on the website. We have an LMS. If you want to train on your own, kind of go through your own different units and tests and different things on PC Recruiter. We also have a YouTube channel and a Learning Center. Our Learning Center is going to have direct how-to's, videos, all sorts of things about that that you have access to every time. So a lot of different avenues to get started. Do you guys offer any sort of free trial that doesn't include like us implementing any data just kind of messing around in the system? I could send you the link to this very database that we looked at today. Let you poke in. It's a live database so don't put anything personal in there but but it is where you can log into an actual real-time live database on our cloud servers see what it's like click through it on your own so you can do that too okay and then from a scalability standpoint you know we're a business that's probably not slowing down so are there fees to continue to add businesses within the platform is there any you know as we're growing outside of like the seats that we would maybe add is there any sort of cost to scaling this platform for us only if you need to buy more training. So the training that's included is initial. It's for your setup. It's a good six months after your conversion's done. So if you use up all the training, you might need to buy more training down the line. It's only $95 an hour or $80 an hour, four hours or more. But there's no, just adding users, it's just kind of add that many user monthly fees, no additional cost. But as far as like if we're adding features, we need to customize the platform again. Like does that cost money as we grow? I know we're going to have it set up that allows us to to kind of add those businesses? We train you how to do it so you know how to do it. And if you need a little assistance, give us a call and the team will help you. And that's part of the training. Yeah, if you said, I want you to design a whole web page to go into this company's site, there might be a little consulting charges with that for our web team. But you have that support. You can do that, though, if we need to continue to grow it in ways that's beyond what they should. Okay, cool. Yeah, and then we'll open an API that you can have access to. if you had anyone that wanted to write an integration query the API yeah you can work with that as well okay do you guys have a mobile app we do very simple it's not everything but it's simple access to they I mean we're not amazed phone numbers email stuff like that I'll be honest with you I'll probably never use the mobile app it's just a question that's on here for some of the folks okay and then as far as like security and compliance goes you know there's a chance we're moving to become a federal contractor is that anything you guys have like background knowledge on not that like we have a lot of that information prepared as well but in terms of how things have to be set up or like any legal processes is that stuff you guys ever get involved with we don't usually make any kind of recommendations but we do have federal contractors using our database uh and i do have a network security policy that i can send that once we get further down the road that goes over all the policies procedures everything like that that's kind of what i was asking and then what is your like breakdown of staffing agencies that use this platform compared to like internal businesses like ourselves? Probably a little heavier on the recruiting agency side, which is why they work like an agency, that's a great fit. We do have internal workers, corporate HR, but the lion's share is probably permanent placement contracts, retained everybody, but pretty much the recruiting. That's what we want. We're leaning towards a platform that is heavier on that side just based on the way we operate, so that's good to hear. Yeah, we're a good match in that space. Okay. Well, I'll tell you what, man. I think this covers a lot of what I need to get done. I am going to recommend we – like I would imagine for a second demo, do you have like an engineer or someone that jumps on to dive in deeper? If I have someone else, is it similar to this? Usually I can hold my own in it. I've been doing this 26 years here. Okay, no, that's fine. That's fine. But if needed, I do have some other people I can pull on a trainer. The trainers usually know a little bit more if you want to really get in the weeds. Or if you know you want to get in the weeds about something, I can include a trainer on the demo. I can certainly do that. Of course, of course. Okay. I would just want my colleague that I'm going through this process with to probably go through a similar demo after I talk to her. So that would be my recommended next step. Is that all right with you? Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, I can show her around, certainly. Have her reach out. Yeah, I'll make the recommendation. I think this is probably one of the ones we want to pursue a little further. Like I said, in terms of our cutting down to five compared to the 15 we're talking to, this seems to fit a lot of what we're looking for. It's smooth. I like the interface. So, yeah, I just need to talk to my team, and then I think I can reach back out to you, or you can follow up with me this week in terms of the next step. Perfect. I'll put a follow-up down for maybe Friday morning if I haven't heard anything from you, if that's reasonable. That sounds good. All right. Fantastic. Very well. Well, I'll check. I look forward to hearing from you, and we can take that next step whenever we're ready. and if I don't hear from you, but like I said, by Friday morning, I'll give you a holler. Sounds good, man. Thank you so much for running through all this. Thank you, sir. All right. Have a great day. Goodbye.",

week.\n\n24\n00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:03,337\nwe had a big work event on Friday and someone got hit by a car and died.\n\n25\n00:02:04,984 --> 00:02:05,359\nOh no.\n\n26\n00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,487\nYeah.\n\n27\n00:02:06,863 --> 00:02:07,956\nSo it's a, sorry to bring that up.\n\n28\n00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,136\nI've got a little weird headspace here today.\n\n29\n00:02:11,266 --> 00:02:11,596\nFor sure.\n\n30\n00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:12,700\nThat certainly is.\n\n31\n00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:14,218\nI hate to see that.\n\n32\n00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:14,560\nYeah.\n\n33\n00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,183\nSo that's,\n\n34\n00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:15,424\nyou know,\n\n35\n00:02:15,464 --> 00:02:15,725\nwith that,\n\n36\n00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:15,886\nyeah,\n\n37\n00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:16,006\nit's,\n\n38\n00:02:16,026 --> 00:02:17,934\nI've never had to deal with anything like this before.\n\n39\n00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,959\nSo we're all kind of going through it together, but I do appreciate you.\n\n40\n00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:24,081\nYeah.\n\n41\n00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,399\nYou hopping on with me today, man.\n\n42\n00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,998\nI'm still excited to talk to you.\n\n43\n00:02:26,462 --> 00:02:27,772\nThis is a big move for us.\n\n44\n00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:29,401\nWe are,\n\n45\n00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:30,784\njust to kind of jump in,\n\n46\n00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:31,084\nsorry,\n\n47\n00:02:31,124 --> 00:02:31,585\nlike I said,\n\n48\n00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,750\nmy head's all over the place here,\n\n49\n00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,934\nbut not sure if you've done any research on ARCO,\n\n50\n00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,437\nbut we are a pretty large general contractor.\n\n51\n00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,999\nWe've got north of like 25 recruiters internally.\n\n52\n00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,787\nAnd I think the first thing I want to just explain to you is we very much act like\n\n53\n00:02:48,007 --> 00:02:51,733\nan agency when it comes to recruiting in a way that we have a lot of businesses\n\n54\n00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:53,737\nwithin ARCO that are all connected,\n\n55\n00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,740\nbut they operate independently.\n\n56\n00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,360\nSo we might treat one business and have certain workflows in the system.\n\n57\n00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,611\nI guess what we're looking to do is be able to treat one business with certain\n\n58\n00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:05,940\nworkflows and another business with others.\n\n59\n00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:08,972\nSo we're currently on ISIMs right now, if you're familiar with them.\n\n60\n00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,618\nOur contract's up with September of next year.\n\n61\n00:03:15,087 --> 00:03:17,080\nIt's like 99.9% looking like we're going to move away from them.\n\n62\n00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:20,034\nSo we are in the process of vetting other ATSs.\n\n63\n00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,124\nThis is probably our ninth call,\n\n64\n00:03:22,164 --> 00:03:22,244\nJim,\n\n65\n00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,933\nand me and my colleague are going through this process.\n\n66\n00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,603\nI think what we're trying to do is by the end of this month,\n\n67\n00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,425\nwhich is obviously just a short time from now,\n\n68\n00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:35,188\nidentify maybe those top three to five platforms that we want to kind of take that\n\n69\n00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,650\nnext step with as far as,\n\n70\n00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,110\nyou know,\n\n71\n00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:39,693\nfull demos with the rest of our team in the hopes of by the end of this year\n\n72\n00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,216\nchoosing who we're going to move forward with for implementation next year.\n\n73\n00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:46,838\nPerfect.\n\n74\n00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,440\nOkay.\n\n75\n00:03:47,861
