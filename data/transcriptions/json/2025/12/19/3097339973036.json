    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yes, hi, Robin. This is Cindy from Bulldog. How are you doing today? I'm good. How are you doing? Good, good. Hey, listen, I have a question for you. I can't get into PC Recruiter. I have a saved link to get into it, but it's just not giving me my login page. So where do I go to to get to the login page? It's telling me the inner... Yeah, it's just... Hold on. want I'm sorry I want hold on let me just send a reply back okay sorry okay I'm so sorry okay so what are you seeing when you go to that login page I don't know what actually when I went to go log in today it said something wasn't connected and I'm like what do you mean you know so usually you know you got to log out log back in but I can't even get to the log out I can't get to the log in part for me to even log in okay it won't when I so where do I go to update and I just wonder if maybe we should clear cache for you. Let's try that. Are you using Chrome? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let me just go away. Yeah. And then select delete browsing data. Browsing data. Okay. Make sure the time range says all time. And then uncheck everything else, leaving only cached images and files selected. Time is all time. Okay, everything except what? Cached images and files. That's the only one you want selected. So browsing history or cookies or anything like that, uncheck those. Okay. Wow, it's taking a long time. Okay. Now let me see if I can go back. Now you might need to close that browser window and then go back. Let's see if that fixed it. Yeah, I did. I did. I closed it. No. Nope. PC is loading. There we go. It's on the left side this time. All right. Now I should be able to get in. Yes, thank you so much. I should have known that. But I was in a hurry this morning. Sometimes if you're kind of like have it up or whatever, as we're updating, it can cause a little issue like that. So sometimes either restarting your computer or clearing cache should usually fix it. Yeah, and let me, while I've got you on the phone, let me just see if I've, my payment stuff is up to date. I just had some changes on pay and some of my things didn't go through this month. And I'm like, when you change, you know, credit card addresses. um let me i'm just trying to check my right now yeah um you had an invoice your yeah everything's current your last invoice was september 6th um okay okay it was another vendor of mine i'm looking at it yeah that one did did go through so if that one is september 6th went through it should go through the next month okay yeah the card we have is 2097 i can't see the full number but it ends in 32837-32897. Does it give you the zip code? 32837? No. Yeah, we have a new one. Okay. So what you'll need to do is go into the customer portal. I'll generate the link for you to send it to you. And I'll just put it again. Yeah. So what you'll do when you go in, if you haven't created an account for this billing portal yet, It doesn't use your PCR information because, well, that's not very secure. But also not everybody that does billing is a Peace Recruiter user. So when you get this link to the customer portal, if you haven't signed up yet, you'll need to click sign up to create the account using your email address and then create a password for it. And then over at the right is a vault area. But what I found you need to do, you need to turn off auto pay first. Then you can delete the card, re-add it. And then you can't like delete the card while it's being used for auto pay. So you have to turn off auto pay for it, delete it, and then you can add the new card. Okay, great. Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate that. Oh, no problem. Have a great week. Thank you. Yeah, when you move, it's like a, I'm sorry, it's a bitch. I had so many different things to change, and I'm like, I'm still not even done yet. You find these things that come up, and you go like, oh, they haven't showed a payment in two months. I guess I got to correct the credit card. is it just for the credit card? Because like we have your billing address as 111 North Orange Avenue. Should we change all that? Yes. Okay. No, no, that's okay. That's correct. It's just my billing address is my home address and we've just moved. Okay. All right. Okay. Thank you very much. If it doesn't match, it won't go through. Okay. Yeah. All righty. Okay. I just got that link. I'll go do it now. Thanks a lot. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Okay. Sure. Bye.",

files selected.\n\n35\n00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:23,867\nTime is all time.\n\n36\n00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:27,134\nOkay, everything except what?\n\n37\n00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,401\nCached images and files.\n\n38\n00:01:32,824 --> 00:01:34,301\nThat's the only one you want selected.\n\n39\n00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:39,045\nSo browsing history or cookies or anything like that, uncheck
