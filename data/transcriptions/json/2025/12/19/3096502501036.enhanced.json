    "text": "uh uh Hello, you've reached Amy Wynn Emery. I am not available at this time. Please leave your name and number and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thank you and have a great day. Hey Amy, it's Jim Lombardo with PCRecruiter. Wanted to give you a quick call here. I have owed you a call. I have to apologize for my delay. I was out for much of the week of the 8th and have just not even been remotely caught up since. So I'm trying to dig out of that hole. But I wanted to give a call back to see about getting you set up on PCRM. What it would be, I would get a new data link created and then you could decide who you wanted to give that to and really everybody could use it but since you only have what about a dozen people that you want to use it those are the only people who usually let let know that it's a thing and then we could do it that way um what I could do um want to talk about paperwork getting it upgraded over to you but I wanted to talk about that too and see about that because I think it's like ten bucks a user normally for everybody but we would do it for only the ones you were starting out and kind of just let me know if you needed to increase that. But let's talk about it sometime. I'm in all week, and hopefully we can connect. 4408560314 is my number. Once again, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. 4408560314. And usually what we'll do is we will get paperwork out once that's signed and returned. We have the new link generated, same username, same passwords, everything like that. And then we will put a ticket in to get a trainer in touch and they can get you scheduled Usually within a couple days notice for the first training to get everybody Online there. So give me a call me to get a moment and we'll talk to you soon 440-856-0314 Thanks",
