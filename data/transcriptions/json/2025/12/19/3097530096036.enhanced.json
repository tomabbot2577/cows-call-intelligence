    "text": "Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi, Teresa. Is Kathy available? Yes. Hold on just a minute, Robin. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Hey, Robin. How are you? I'm doing okay. Good. I haven't talked to you in a while. I wanted to fill you in on a little project I started for myself, what I'm doing. Okay. Okay. So I'm going into QuickBooks. You know at the top right you can do the search, and I'm just searching for the word canceled. I'll do other things like canceling, canceled, or the 1L. but I'm trying to find people at least have that note of canceled, making sure their database is disabled, that there's no recurring, and then I'm marking it as inactive as long as there was no bailout or anything. Okay. So it's going to take a while because I'm sure there's a ton of customers that don't even have that marked, but at least it's starting with those. Sure. Help clean some of this up. Okay. I just wanted to tell you what I was doing so you're not like, wait a minute, why is this? But they should be like truly, truly canceled. database disabled and everything. I think I caught two where the database was never disabled. Oh my goodness. I know. I'm sure there are lots of those actually. Actually, I think I only found two so far. So that's pretty good, but I'm just making sure all of that. So that way it's just cleaner when you look at the customer list. Yes. Perfect. And again, I don't think they really did that too much. So we'll see how many of these end up coming up with because when I do this search it only shows me um I don't know maybe was this maybe 15 to 20 at a time but once I make them inactive then they don't come up when I come up when I search canceled so but that's what I'm doing nice okay I like it I figured that'll help us it will it will be and that will help clean it up too because right now there's just there's way too many in there I mean there's some there's some people that haven't that haven't been active you know six seven eight years and yet they they still are active there and it they should be disabled and then or made inactive and then we don't have as many things to sort through right yeah so yeah just wanted to tell you but i figured it was absolutely safe because you mentioned it before like these should be inactive so the phones have been a little quieter lately so i'm like all I'm going to do a little here and there between calls. Yeah. Because they can always be made active again. So it's not, they don't, it says delete a lot of times, but it's not really deleting. So it can always be brought back. So it just keeps a cleaner, shorter list to go through. So, yep, that's perfect. I agree. Okay. All right. Just wanted to tell you. Thank you. Have a good week. Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye-bye.",

available?\n\n4\n00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,150\nYes.\n\n5\n00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,750\nHold on just a minute, Robin.\n\n6\n00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,350\nThank you.\n\n7\n00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:05,950\nYou're welcome.\n\n8\n00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:06,550\nThank you.\n\n9\n00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:06,087\nHey, Robin.\n\n10\n00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:07,816\nHow are you?\n\n11\n00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:10,059\nI'm doing okay.\n\n12\n00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:10,852\nGood.\n\n13\n00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,100\nI haven't talked to you in a while.\n\n14\n00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,977\nI wanted to fill you in on a little project I started for myself, what I'm doing.\n\n15\n00:01:16,887 --> 00:01:16,976\nOkay.\n\n16\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:17,684\nOkay.\n\n17\n00:01:18,262 --> 00:01:19,354\nSo I'm going into QuickBooks.\n\n18\n00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:21,850\nYou know at the top right you can do the search,\n\n19\n00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,620\nand I'm just searching for the word canceled.\n\n20\n00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,799\nI'll do other things like canceling, canceled, or the 1L.\n\n21\n00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:30,945\nbut I'm trying to find people at least have that note of canceled,\n\n22\n00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:32,668\nmaking sure their database is disabled,\n\n23\n00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:33,550\nthat there's no recurring,\n\n24\n00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,577\nand then I'm marking it as inactive as long as there was no bailout or anything.\n\n25\n00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:40,014\nOkay.\n\n26\n00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,331\nSo it's going to take a while because I'm sure there's a ton of customers that\n\n27\n00:01:44,352 --> 00:01:45,294\ndon't even have that marked,\n\n28\n00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:46,718\nbut at least it's starting with those.\n\n29\n00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,327\nSure.\n\n30\n00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,853\nHelp clean some of this up.\n\n31\n00:01:50,722 --> 00:01:50,898\nOkay.\n\n32\n00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,794\nI just wanted to tell you what I was doing so you're not like,\n\n33\n00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:54,317\nwait a minute,\n\n34\n00:01:54,337 --> 00:01:54,820\nwhy is this?\n\n35\n00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,800\nBut they should be like truly, truly canceled.\n\n36\n00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,560\ndatabase disabled and everything.\n\n37\n00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,080\nI think I caught two where the database was never disabled.\n\n38\n00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,600\nOh my goodness.\n\n39\n00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,160\nI know.\n\n40\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,060\nI'm sure there are lots of those actually.\n\n41\n00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:13,100\nActually, I think I only found two so far.\n\n42\n00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,280\nSo that's pretty good, but I'm just making sure all of that.\n\n43\n00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,500\nSo that way it's just cleaner when you look at the customer list.\n\n44\n00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:21,760\nYes.\n\n45\n00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,060\nPerfect.\n\n46\n00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,480\nAnd again, I don't think they really did that too much.\n\n47\n00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,969\nSo we'll see how many of these end up coming up with because when I do this search\n\n48\n00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:37,373\nit only shows me um I don't know maybe was this maybe 15 to 20 at a time but once I\n\n49\n00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:42,557\nmake them inactive then they don't come up when I come up when I search canceled so\n\n50\n00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:48,046\nbut that's what I'm doing nice okay I like it I figured that'll help us it will it\n\n51\n00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:52,925\nwill be and that will help clean it up too because right now there's just there's\n\n52\n00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:57,500\nway too many in there I mean there's some there's some people that haven't that\n\n53\n00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:02,074\nhaven't been active you know six seven eight years and yet they they still are\n\n54\n00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:06,953\nactive there and it they should be disabled and then or made inactive and then we\n\n55\n00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:11,832\ndon't have as many things to sort through right yeah so yeah just wanted to tell\n\n56\n00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:16,406\nyou but i figured it was absolutely safe because you mentioned it before like these\n\n57\n00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:21,286\nshould be inactive so the phones have been a little quieter lately so i'm like all\n\n58\n00:03:21,286 --> 00:03:24,640\nI'm going to do a little here and there between calls.\n\n59\n00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:24,900\nYeah.\n\n60\n00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,260\nBecause they can always be made active again.\n\n61\n00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,459\nSo it's not,\n\n62\n00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:30,965\nthey don't,\n\n63\n00:03:30,965 --> 00:03:32,735\nit says delete a lot of times,\n\n64\n00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:34,000\nbut it's not really deleting.\n\n65\n00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,580\nSo it can always be brought back.\n\n66\n00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,980\nSo it just keeps a cleaner, shorter list to go through.\n\n67\n00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,700\nSo, yep, that's perfect.\n\n68\n00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,160\nI agree.\n\n69\n00:03:45,560 --> 00:0",
