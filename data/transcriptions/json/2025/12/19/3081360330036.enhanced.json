Push 1 to leave a message in our general mailbox. 2 to contact Mike Lucas. Transferring to Denise Lucas. Phone ringing. Phone ringing. Hello, you have reached the office of Denise Lucas at extension 109. I'm on another call at this time or away from my office. If you will leave your name and telephone number, I will return your call. Thanks for calling L2 Consulting. Hi, Denise. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I was giving you a call back. Sorry, I was on the phone. We have some people at lunch as well. Anyway, you can't print directly if you went to company and then hit names, but if you took those names and put them into a roll-up list, then you'd be able to select and print or even export to Excel depending on your securities. You had also mentioned that you're trying to compare it with a different list. So sometimes it might be helpful if you want to see who's on one list. Well, they can't be. It'd be too different. If you wanted to see like people that are in that list, but maybe compared to another, there might be some search options with that. Anyway, give me a call when you have a moment. My number is 440-946-5214 and I'm at extension 5466. Thank you. Have a great day. Talk to you soon. Bye.",
