Calling on behalf of our business owner, Eric Axelrod, here at Pinnacle Search Professionals. How are you today, sir? Good. How are you? Good, good. So I'm calling today in regards to the new feature, this AI candidate match. When I go to the position, I don't see the AI candidate match in the action menu. Can you assist that? So Eric would need to put in a request for that feature to be added to the database. from the PCR login screen if you click on the blog post that we have about it that introducing AI candidate match you can press more there's a forum at the bottom of that blog post to request that it be activated but that needs to come from Eric I see, yes, how do I get this? got it Okay. And beyond that, does Eric need to do any additional steps? So what will happen once he fills that out is he'll just get an email back from one of our – someone on our team here just confirming that you want it activated in the database. let me check here what so you're on keyword version 2 so what this is going to what's going to happen is it'll also need you'll also need to upgrade your searching index in the database to Lucene so you're going to get Eric's going to get some information about that as well to look over to confirm that you're okay with the upgrade to Lucene and that you're okay with the feature being activated. And then once we get that back, we start that process of updating it to Lucene. And then once you're up to Lucene, we have to re-index the database for the feature to work properly. Understood. All right. Thank you, Tyler. I will relay that information to Eric. Yep, not a problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. Very good. Appreciate your time and help today.
