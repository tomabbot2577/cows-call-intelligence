    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hello, my name is Margie from WorldBridge Partner, Chicago Northwest. How's it going? How can I help you today? Okay, so I work for the Gary Bozer. I have one query in my PCR. Okay. Let me find that company name again. Can you spell that? Walbridge Partners, Chicago, Northwest. Walbridge Partners, Chicago. Okay, I found it. Thank you so much. And then, yeah, what is the issue you're seeing today on TCA? Okay, so I have a query in my PCI. There is one company in the retail graphic communication. Okay, so in the in the CTO stage, it is changed by automatic. So you're saying there's an automation at a certain roll-up stage? No, it is in a company name. Oh, in the company record. The company name is Sreejaya Graphic Communication. I just logged into your database. I'm just looking for Richard's Graphic. There it is. Richard's graphic communications. Okay. And so I've got the record pulled up. And then what's the issue with this record? You can see the activities. I'm sorry, say that again. You can see the activities. I can maybe we should get on a screen share and then I can see what you're looking at and seeing what the issue is. Maybe that would help. OK. Yeah. So go to a new tab in your browser and go to the Web site meetings that ring central dot com. meetings. Yes. Meetings. Ring central. Dot com. Dot com. Okay. And I can give you a meeting ID if it's asking for that. Yeah. Okay. That is one nine three. One six. 193166. Yeah, 193166. 024. 024. Does that work when you tried to join the meeting? Oh, yeah. I see you joined now. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen at the top. You can see it on my screen. It's loading now. I should see it in a second here. Okay, yeah, I can see that. All right, Richard's graphics. Okay, so go ahead and show me the problem you're seeing. Okay. Give me a second. Okay, no problem. uh excuse it or i should go or Okay. Okay. Okay, I can see that again. So you can see my screen. Oh yeah. Okay. Okay so firstly in the city field, there is an update to the outside decorator. So that is not updated from our site. Okay. Let's see. So my question is, it is automatically changed? It looks like it might have been changed. Okay, so it says the username was GLB. We made the change, but company, city. screen was on REG7. Maybe it was related to the a profile or like a questionnaire because it looks like on the same day right below that a profile form was filled out for this company and it maybe was that profile that Ended up updating the city. Let me double check that. I'm going to see if there's any profiles in your database that might be linked to that. Okay. Where if they fill out an answer in the profile, it would maybe update the actual record field. Let's see. So I'm going back to Richards Communication. The record was merged on that date. Let's see. Merged. Okay. Yeah, that makes more sense. And so the reason why at 919 at that time, the city was changed to outside recruiter, I mean, is because you merged two company records together. And you must have selected the master company during the merge process that had outside recruiter listed as the city. So it overwrote whatever the city field was before because of the merging process. Okay. Give me a second. Okay. Okay, so I want to know that there are other companies that the information like that. I'm sorry, say that again. So I want to know, there are other companies also there, like this company, the city outsider recruiter. So is there any chance with other companies? We can take a look with a search. So if you go back to basic search up at the top there, and then where it says city, you clear out where it says Richard's graphic and then where it says city just type in outside recruiter and that value there you go and hit search okay good yeah so that was the only company it looks like that had outside recruiter um and it was just because of a merge but it looks like you have corrected it to the right city now the bell would be there. Okay. Okay. Thank you for the help. Yeah, no problem. If you have any other questions or any other problems come up, just let us know. Okay. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye. You too. Bye.",
