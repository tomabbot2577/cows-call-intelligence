Hi, this message is for John Dunn. John, this is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I got your inquiry through our website yesterday and thought I'd give you a call, see how I could help you learn more about PC Recruiter. If you had any questions I could answer, if you wanted to get a demonstration on the schedule to learn more, please give me a call. Let me know. My phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I'll pop you an email as well if it's easier to correspond that way. Hopefully we can connect soon. Thanks, John. We'll talk to you soon.",
