    "text": "calling main sequence this is robin we've got to quit meeting like this how are you i'm good and yourself oh pretty good how are the kids good they're doing pretty good um got to see my daughter over the weekend yeah they're both yeah my son's at ou and my daughter's at ohio state so okay fuck i yeah yeah so we actually went to so It's kind of rare that it happens, but Ohio State actually played OU. So we actually got tickets and went to the family. It was a ton of fun. And then my daughter came home this past weekend, so I got to see her two weekends in a row. Now, did she bring laundry to do or laundry for you to do? No, she's actually really good about that. She hardly ever brings laundry home. She manages to get her zone done. um it's my son that will come home with tons and tons of laundry well my my mom and and my wife said to the kids there's the washing machine go for it yeah yeah he doesn't and he's so bad like he's so funny because like the first time he left and he did his own laundry like you know first year i used to yell him at all the time like about everything being inside out especially socks you and just kind of rip them off. So finally, first time he did his own laundry at school, he calls me and goes, I am so sorry. And I'm like, what happened? He goes, well, I did my own laundry and all of my socks were inside out. He goes, it's a total pain. I'm like, I told you. I'm like, you make everything like so much harder just because you won't turn your socks the right way. And at that moment in their life, it wasn't important. They didn't understand the value. Yeah. Well, then he came home like, you know, one of the times last year. I think it was like after the school year. And he had, of course, all of his laundry needed to be done because he didn't do it. And, yeah, it was like, dude, you didn't listen. You didn't learn. Did you do the laundry, mother? Yes, I did. Stop that. Stop it. Stop it. I know. I'm such an enabler. You're enabling it. I'm serious. I love you, but you've got to stop that. I know. Oh, it's hard. We all go through this. Yeah. Yeah. This is your daughter's first year away, right? No, it's her second. Well, here's the big difference, too. No, it's my son's third, my daughter's second. But here's the big difference, too. At OU, you have to pay for laundry. It's like $2 to wash, $1 to dry. So he doesn't like saving his little money, you know, spending the little money he has at school on laundry. where at Ohio State at least the laundry is free so my daughter just kind of she just does it whenever she needs to I wish they didn't charge for laundry but they do at OU it's part of real life you know it's part of real life yeah I remember going for orientation at Ohio State and they said it's about you know and the laundry machines are free and I'm like oh That's nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right. Yeah, so the record access. So there's only an option based on username. It's called restrict access. Problem with it when you try to implement this is you have to have access to the other related records, too. So if you were to turn it on for a user, let's say it's me. let's say the username is robin i would only be able to see a record or anything if it has the username robin however let's say it's a candidate that has my name but i'm in a company that i don't have access to i wouldn't be able to see that company so it becomes very muddy and then you've got to do all these groups and quite frankly it's just not worth it um so i wanted to ask what the intent was because you can make like a roll-up list where the roll-up list isn't shared um but if you really start limiting access by username it gets very hard because like when they go to put in a name they don't know what's already in there because they can't see it that can get messy or if like somebody's in the default company and they don't have access to that then they won't see those candidates so it gets a little muddy that way so sometimes it's better just to say, hey, if you just want to see your own, just use that as part of your search criteria. Well, five years ago when we first came on board, we, well, at A-Time, we had one recruiter that was taking another recruiter's company and putting them in his roll-up and calling them. Yeah, so I like to think of it as, and I don't mean to sound rude, you know, just make it a management issue, like, you know, don't do this. I don't want to have to limit you from seeing other things, so just don't do it. You know, just use it as part of your search criteria where you're only looking for names that have your name. Because, again, otherwise you have to make all these groups. Like, let's say, like, your default company or any, like, you'd almost want to make a username called candidate and put it under there. That way they could see anybody that applied online or even the default company. But again, like if you have a company record that has somebody else's username, you won't be able to access the candidates because you're not supposed to be able to access anything for that company or I'm sorry, the contacts within that company. So it gets a little messy that way. I have no problem. I have no problem not putting the restrictions on. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on just tell people, use your own companies. Yeah. Can they see my roll-ups? Yeah. Now, roll-ups, though, what that is, is you can make them shared or not shared when you're creating the list name. Now, if you say no, what happens is when somebody goes to roll-ups on the main toolbar, they would not see your list if you set that shared option to no. Now, as an administrator, you would have this option. They would not, as long as they're not an administrator. You would have a shared roll-up. So let's say you had a user that made roll-ups not shared. You could say show shared, and you could at least see it, and then you would see it in red. So that way you know it's somebody else's list, but they didn't share it. Okay. because you might need to monitor why are they making lists shared or do I want to delete it or things like that so as an administrator you'd be able to see everything alright next question thanks for the training tips appreciate it very much how do I make first of all I sign into PC Recruiter and it comes up with this other company name it comes up with Let's see what it says. BGSS, Bennett Gaynor Sustainable Staffing. That's really odd. Did you use your link or did you just try to Internet search for your link? I just did an Internet search for my link. Oh, yeah, you can't do that. Yeah, you don't want to do that. You've got to use your link and make sure your bookmark is your link. because every organization has their own link. Yours ends in recruiting solutions. I don't know why theirs was coming up in an Internet search, but here, I'll send you what you have to use. I've got my link up. That's not a problem. So when I set these people up, you send me an email. Let's see if I can find that email quickly. Sliding over here. Gosh, what do I do before two screens? I have no idea. Oh, I know. I did it for so many years, and everyone else I worked with would have like two, if not three. And they're like, how do you do it? I'm like, I don't know. I'm just used to it. So now I use two, and I just tend to open more windows because I'm constantly – I'm like in like eight different things at one time. I'm totally multitasking all the time. but then every once in a while I have to go for these I think I go every eight weeks for these IV treatments for my colitis and I bring my laptop with me and I feel so limited because I only have one screen I'm like wow I'm a lot slower doing it with just one screen all right let's see adding a new seat adding a new seat capture no no no no oh why not back and forth slow down slow down to speed up. I don't know why he went straight to Borsmel. My phone never rang. Oh. It never rang. I looked down and said, what's wrong with you? She's usually very punctual. So I think I'm going to have to go ahead and set up Ring Central. I've been using my cell phone. Maybe if you're calling out. Were you calling out for anything? No, I wasn't on the phone. I was just sitting here on the computer. never even rang. At first, I thought it was bad reception. I even switched carriers. Bad reception, but right now, I've got full internet and I got two out of four bars. It's all coming in on the internet. Let's see. What day did you send me the one on how to set people up? That was Wednesday or Tuesday? Let me see. It wasn't Wednesday. Maybe it was. Oh, we all got like PCR capture in the trail. Oh, no, setting up third street. I'm back to 850 on Wednesday morning. Tuesday, 1016 a.m. Eastern. 10, 17, 16. There it is. Okay. 10, 16. All right. When I'm in PCR, I'm popping it open right now, where do I find the user management area? So you're going to click system on the – so you've got to go in as yourself because you're an administrator. You're going to go to system on the main toolbar, and you're going to go to users, and then manage users. All right. Users. Users. Okay. There. I see. manage users okay all right so I always see right now me and Rob Micah yeah so you'll have to use the add option at the top right and then definitely follow those instructions that I sent you because one of the very important things is copying settings from an existing user if you don't do that their securities their preferences their layouts they're really really bad or not correctly so you definitely want to copy settings from an existing user and then even just double check their securities copy so when you get into add it's at the very bottom so I included a screenshot like you don't need to do anything under the other information but you definitely want to make sure like your contact security information and copy settings from username that they're all expanded so you see what's under there all right so I need to open up if If you look in the email that I sent you. Yeah, if you look in the email, do you see the screenshot? Let me pull it back up. Yep. Let me draw it down. Yep. Yep. Okay. So above I have all the instructions, but basically it will end up looking like below. You know how all of our brains are different? My wife can read a book and understand everything. I can look at your screenshot and all this and it doesn't make any sense to me. It's all jumbled. But I'm great at selling. Leave me away from computers. And I'm great at selling. So what I would do is fill in the person, the contact information. I fill in the new person's name and their contact phone number. Yeah, their email address, their phone number, and then other security information. That's where you'll create the username and their password. And then under copy settings from username, you're going to want to copy somebody else's settings to this user. Otherwise, they're going to have bad layouts and things like that. Okay. All right. So I just hit under settings, copy settings from username, and just hit leave it as it is. Well, no, I don't know what you're doing there. So when you click add, you've got to create the user. Under the manage users, you're going to have to follow those directions of hitting add, filling out that information, copy settings from the existing username, and then clicking save. then you definitely want to review what's under security settings so that way you're not accidentally giving somebody access to things that they should not have, double-checking their preferences, and then you have to give them the URL that they log in as well as the username and password you assigned to them. Let me try it on my own. If I get swamped, I'll call you. Let's see. How to make reminders on future. if I have an appointment to call someone in three months, how do I do that? So when you're writing an activity, let's say you are in the add activity screen. If you like just. Let me go back. Add activity. What's that under? Is it under company name? It depends who you're making it for. Like if it's for a person, you would start from the name. Right. I'm there. Click add activity, which is an icon at the top right. Top right. Of their name record, those action icons. I just hit the person, so I've got a person pulled up. Okay. So in the menu at the top right, kind of like by where you have save, it looks like two little chat bubbles. Is your add activity option? No. They go in the wrong place. So I'm in Facebook search. So, yeah, open up somebody's name record. Like you can click right from the reason I do. Oh, I have to actually open the name record. Okay. Open the name record. Okay. It's open. And then in the menu over the far right where you've got, like, you're making changes and saving the record, there's an add activity option to add an activity to that record. All right. the person popped up down below. Remember, I'm still struggling with this. I really am. But add name, is that what I'm doing? No. No, you've already got the name in. So it looks like two little chat bubbles. When you hover on it, it'll say add activity. Let's see. Add save name, add name, add activity. That is? That is. That's it. So when you add an activity, there's two sections. The top is usually, you know, for something that you already did. Let's say you called and left a message or you spoke with them. That's what you'll use at the top. And then where it says schedule follow-up down at the bottom, you'll want to make sure that's expanded. And then that's where you can do your follow-up date and time. So if you just spoke with them today and you're going to follow up in three months, under schedule follow-up that's where you can put that follow-up and then that'll go to your pcr schedule i can pick the time that's beautiful i know i haven't dealt this deep and i didn't know that okay so i said okay and so a bell should go off long time um pcr open At 2 o'clock this afternoon? Yes. Okay, bingo. There's an option to set an alarm for it, the duration of the appointment, and then that will go to your PCR schedule for the date and time that you set. Where's that? Where's PCR schedule? Back to the top again? Yeah, that's up on your main toolbar. Schedule. Oh, see. I didn't know this was there. I did not even know this was there. I showed you that. Come on. There's no way I didn't show you that. Right? I hope I did. Off the record. Well, you may have. Off the record, in the last year, I've had a couple of mini strokes. So don't know what you showed me or not. Oh, I'm so sorry. But, you know, I'm still fine. You know, I don't know any difference. so and you could tell me you did something i'll go okay that's usually one of the probably like second session usually get into that could be could be could be all right um if i need additional training for me or my people what does that cost um it's 95 for an hour now if you think you're going to use more than that if you purchase four or more hours it's less expensive. It's only $80 per hour. What's nice about the purchase training is it doesn't expire. Your onboarding time does, but your purchase training, you could say, okay, I want to use an hour this week, an hour next week, and the two hours, we just kind of bank them until the two hours left. We just bank them until whenever you're ready to use them. I didn't know the onboard training expired, so I know that it started. I saw your email. We never got to sequencing. Now, that one, let me see. Sequencing. Didn't you, like you, if I remember right, you did your initial. Yeah, you did your initial and then we went to $50 a seat. And then you added. But I think that ticket's still open. Let me see. Okay. So you have 15 minutes left from your onboarding, and then you have, we didn't use the two hours with the new product edition, which would be your sequencing and mail campaigns. So that we could use for that. Yeah, I'll let you do that. Okay. Normally we do it and make them expire, but. I'll do it. Sequencing, two hours. Okay. I don't understand the sequencing at all. But once I get all four of us up to a certain level in PCR knowledge, then we'll do the sequencing. So we do it all at one time. Yeah. Because I've got the five of us now. Hey, look, God has a sense of humor. He, you know, if you put plans out there, he may laugh at them. That's the thunder. Him laughing at our plans. He has totally different plans. let me see I always think too if I don't let me get where do I have it hold on one second there's like a short little video on sequencing yeah sequencing I find introduction to is this it this one I always tell people just watch the video kind of gives you a little bit of help in understanding what it does watch this first it's a quick one if you You won't know how to use it after, you know, but at least it gives you a little help. I'm going to go out and get a big-ass, pardon my language, big-ass monitor. I did not know you could enlarge your monitor until just, you know, control and use your mouse. I didn't know you could enlarge the effects on your monitor. Ah. You know, if you don't know, you don't know. Yeah. and let's see the last question was i think that's it thank you for your time today you are welcome sorry for the back and forth no no that's fine that's fine the last time we talked or time before you were having empty nest syndrome and the kids were all gone i know the first like three weeks are are rough at least this time like we went down there and then she came home last because It was one of her friends' birthdays, so she came in Saturday night and left Monday morning. So at least I got to see them a little. You know, when you go, like, missing them. How far away is school for her? Oh, hers isn't bad. She's only two hours. But my son's is, like, three and a half. I mean, granted, like, I mean, her roommate's, like, ten hours from where she lives. But it's just so hard when you run around with them. Because both my kids, especially my daughter, she was so active in everything. like you know her senior year was like a whirlwind because she cheered um she cheered varsity football and varsity basketball she was also a captain on varsity soccer so literally like in the fall we were tuesday thursday saturday playing soccer friday nights football i mean it was crazy and then you had like homecoming and she was on the sweet 16 so she you know you had to do like the walk on the field and the assembly and all that stuff and then homecoming and then she was in powder puff and she was like a winter formal princess and then she was also like a student head council officer so it was like senior year was madness there was always something going on and then so when you're running around with her you know watching her play or you know do all these things then suddenly you don't get to see her at all it was just it was it was hard you know Very hard. It sounds like you all are friends also. Oh, yeah. We do so much together. She's my little buddy. She's my little buddy. I came home and my daughter was home for something from college. And I walked in and my wife was helping her with the math. The thing is, this is an 18-year-old sitting in her mother's lap as they're going over math. ass and that was you know because they're my daughters are like you and your daughter they're buds yeah yeah we're really close like let's look at home like you're going to come cuddle with me she's like okay ma'am like stop you know i know she won't do that but wish she would i'm a little jealous of your wife question is is there cell software for pcr is what can i use pcr on my cell phone you know there's a mobile app you can download and connect it to your database you'll have to use that same url to connect it it's a light version of peace recruiter you don't have all your features but it's good for like um let's say you're on the go and you're like oh i need to call this person. I need their phone number. Can you send me that link? Actually, I can't because you've got to get it out of your phone's store. Are you like iPhone? Are you iPhone or Samsung? iPhone. So if you go to the app store on your iPhone, what is it called? Let me see. What is it called in here? Is it PC Recruiter Mobile? Yeah, it'll say start typing in PC recruiter into the app search option and you'll see peace recruiter mobile 2.0 2.0 okay good yeah so with that what it does yeah it uh it's not full-blown priest recruiter there's just way too many features but at least it's good for i need to like quickly uh pull up a name and maybe add a note to the record okay that's why because if i'm on the road and i don't have a can of data issue with me. I want to be able to reach out to him. I can get his number. Yeah. Like some people have like way higher expectations. They're like, no, I want piece or critter. Like you can't fit piece or critter on a phone. It's just, it's really just meant to be like, you know, kind of look up, add a note, things like that. Are there times where I can have multiple screens open at the same time in PCR on different monitors? Yeah, you can actually log into your own database more than once. on your computer. Now, the app is different, though. Okay. All right. Thank you much. I appreciate your time. All right. Have a great week. You too. Thanks. Now, this is something, you want to do something that's going to spark your kids' eyes a little different. You know, you could take a pumpkin and mail it without a box. Just put the address on it to the kids at college and they will ship it like that. I think they'd be happy if I sent them money well the kids go down to the mailbox and there's a pumpkin for them that's funny mom's thinking about me you know my son loves when I send him money for Chipotle that's when he's like like every once in a while I'll send him like every once in a while I'll send him like $15 and I'm like you know I'll send it like in Vemo with like a little memo of Chipotle and he's like oh, thank you. That's what he likes. I'm sorry, what were you saying? Have you read the book How to Win Friends and Influence People? No, but I think you told me about it. It's a classic. Yeah, I think I started to listen to it and then I just got distracted. Well, this is why I suggest you give it to the kids either for their birthday or Christmas a paperback. And the third page from the back, put a little note in there, theme me for $10. And you'll know they've read it. That's cute. And it's a classic on how to communicate. It's been around for 80 years and still on the bestseller list. So it's really that good. And it will help them with communication skills. How to Win Friends and Influence People by Norman Vincent Peale. I may have mention this? I feel like I downloaded it in something. What would I have downloaded? I have a attention deficit. I have a hard time thinking. My Amazon account? I think so. I just never got to it, though. That's okay. That's okay. But give them a hard... Now, my freshman year in college, I was a bad student because I highlighted everything in black. No, I was... I didn't study. That's funny. I go back and highlight things. Have you ever seen a movie the second time and you go, I don't remember that? A lot of the time. When you go back and read that book a second or third time, it'll have more information. It'll jump out at you. It's really that good, and it will help the kids. If they'll sit down and read it, it really is that good. It's 125 pages, 170 pages, and a paperback. It's small. Maybe I'll get that for them. Yeah, for the Christmas. But put that note in the back, the third page in the back. See me for $10, Mom. That's a sneaky way of finding out, right? If they're right. Yeah, maybe I'll do it during the break because I think if I handed my daughter something else to read right now, she might just flip out because she is a little overwhelmed. She's got physics, organic chemistry, and engineering calculus, too. What's she going to be studying for? Chemical engineering. Good for her. Does she have people to do it? Oh, totally. She's definitely a people person. So, yeah, she was going to do biomedical engineering, and then she was like, I don't think I want to do the medical part of it. She's like, I think I just want to do chemical engineering. because, I don't know, biomedical. A lot of people are trying to do biomedical, and there may not be a lot of jobs in it. And she just thinks just chemical engineering is going to be more job opportunities. Chemical engineering with a master's in biomedical or medical equipment is a total different world. That's more valuable. Also, material science, a master's in material science would put her heads and shoulders above everybody else. Does your daughter have individuals that she uses as mentors? Kind of. I mean, I think so. Okay. Let me throw an idea out. I'm going somewhere with this. I believe all of us should have five or six people that have different subject areas, our pastor, finance, banking, that we can just kick an idea around them once or twice a year. You know, hey, Johnny, good talking to you. But you ask them to be a mentor. So that way, if they're reading a book, they'll say, you know, I need to get this to Robin. It's a good book for Robin. but if your daughter's going down that path of engineering, I have a person that maybe I can introduce her to. She is a PhD in material science. She's a director of R&D at a medical company, and she might be willing to take your daughter on as a mentor. What's rare about this individual I just mentioned is, like your daughter, is just people skills. A lot of engineers don't have people skills. They don't at all. They have math, but they don't have people skills. My cousin's son went to Purdue. He was going to do aerospace engineering, then decided to do mechanical, more marketable. Like you're saying, a lot of people don't have the people skills. He could talk to anybody. He's just very cool. He's just very nice. I'm in Circleville, Ohio. He can get, he's just very simple kind of guy and, but he can understand it. But then also he's a very good, you know, very good at talking to people. So he's been promoted. He was hired while he was given an internship. They wanted to hire him and he's like, well, I still have like another year of school. And they're like, oh, so he's still at that company that he did his internship with and they promoted him. And he's like kind of like second in charge now. And he's only like early 30s because he can have his team of engineers, but they can also meet with customers. So he's working kind of like in the automotive area. And he gets sent to like Germany and all these other places. And, you know, people like him. And so he's done really well for himself just because he can talk, but also understands the technical side of it. so I would tell my daughter that too I'm like that's it you don't even have to do the engineering because at first she didn't want to be an engineer at all she wanted to be a doctor well now she's totally flipped she's like I don't think I want to do the medical and then surprisingly I really like the engineering part so she switched her major which is not a big deal because she'd have to take the same she has to take the same classes anyway so she got lucky that way um so she's um yeah she's liking what she's doing just kind of flipped it surprisingly have you ever told your kids something and they yeah yeah yeah that's mom and the neighbor says the same thing next week and they go oh what a great idea oh well with my son especially i tell him something i have no idea I'm talking about. His cousin that's like 28 tells my son something and it's like oh like the heavens opened and you know God came right down and told him. Well what I try to do with young individuals first of all I'm an advisor for a fraternity that I was in many years ago. I work with young college kids but I try to get them to start developing mentors. I endeavor to get make sure they sit in in front of the class. They meet the professor the first or second day and induce themselves to get to know them. Your kids have already done this, but I'm trying to show you the things that I do with young people. And then I start getting them reading books to expand themselves outside of their technology or whatever they're studying. Because what we find is the 3.8 and above GPA people are usually R&D nerds who can't talk. it's the 2.8, the 3.5 are the still good students, but they're the ones that can talk and oftentimes become managers. Yeah. And if you want, I have no problem talking to your kids someday. Just to kick around ideas and see how they're doing. So it's not mom saying it. Just an idea. I appreciate that. I'm offering that. But for your daughter, this PhD, she is an advocate for women in the workplace. And your daughter would like her right away. As a matter of fact, if you want to look her up, her name is Amy Blakely. I'm sorry, Amy Blakely? Blakely, right. She's up in Minnesota, I think, right now. Amy is a real good egg. I've been mentoring Amy for, oh, gosh, 11 years. Let me see. Research and development leader. Is this her? Mm-hmm. Brown hair. Sure. Her labory. Labory, labory. That's it. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Chemical technologies. If your daughter would just recount her on her own, Amy will start a conversation. And again, that takes it where they don't hear it from mom. Right. I trust Amy completely. Amy got two kids and a husband and really a good egg. And if your daughter wants an induction, I'll make an induction because I'm that high on Amy. She's an alternate faculty member. Ah, okay. She's no lightweight. Yeah. You know, and her husband had brain surgery like 10, 12 years ago. So, you know, she handles a lot. Well, she went to Cornell, North Dakota State University. Nice. No lightweight. But again, to find an engineer with people skills, but to find a woman who's an advocate to help others get ahead, that's even harder to find. Yeah, I think this year she has to get like an internship. And one of her friends' dad, he's like a vice president of engineering for a company here. And I'm like, oh, I'm hoping he'll give her one because then she doesn't have to leave me. well that hey she should apply to two or three places for internship oh yeah absolutely but that way she has a choice if you want me to make an introduction for you i will all righty let me run it by her first and then uh yeah i'm gonna pick you up on that one well remember it's not coming from mom you know oh that's right mom speaking you know But the neighbor says something, and it's like, ah, what an idea. And I'll work with your son if you want. What's he majoring in? He was going to do engineering. Now he's going into business. He's a little undecided still at this point. He's not as motivated as she is, we'll just say. So is his motivation the party, the girls, or? All of the above. Okay. So, yeah. Is he in a fraternity or is he in the camp? Yep. Yep, he's in a fraternity now. What fraternity? He's a beta something. Okay. Beta. Again, I can relate to him probably better than your daughter because I was Greek. He just takes longer. He's the one that, he's the one of the kids that when you try him like, you know, the stove is hot, he's still going to touch it. he's one of those guys. Mm-hmm. I'm saying. Well, I do have to get going. I've got to... I'm late. I have a 12 o'clock call I've got to take. If I can help you, holler. Alrighty. Sounds good. You've got my number. Alright. See ya. Alrighty.

time\n\n19\n00:01:16,233 --> 00:01:20,236\nlike about everything being inside out especially socks you and just kind of rip\n\n20\n00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:20,496\nthem off.\n\n21\n00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:26,741\nSo finally,\n\n22\n00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:29,071\nfirst time he did his own laundry at school,\n\n23\n00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:29,954\nhe calls me and goes,\n\n24\n00:01:29,974 -->

00:01:46,792\nAnd at that moment in their life, it wasn't important.\n\n33\n00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,418\nThey didn't understand the value.\n\n34\n00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:50,258\nYeah.\n\n35\n00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,139\nWell, then he came home like, you know, one of the times last year.\n\n36\n00:01:53,502 --> 00:01:55,338\nI think it was like after the school
