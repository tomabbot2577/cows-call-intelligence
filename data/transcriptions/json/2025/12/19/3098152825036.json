    "text": "Hello, can you hear me sir? How's it going? Hi, yes, going good. Who am I speaking with by the way? This is Garrett. Hey Garrett, yeah, this is Nick, man. I just had a two-hour meeting with Robin last week, and we went through all the settings for PCS. are. And I think it was like one or two of them had gotten switched for no reason this Monday morning, like while I was in the meeting with the team and everything. And I want to see if we could jump on a quick screen share so I can show you what settings were switched. It shouldn't take very long to fix it. Sure. Yeah, let me pull up a screen share. One second. Okay, thank you so much. I'll just have you go to a new tab in your browser and just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. And then once the meeting ID is there. One second, it's still firing up on my end. My internet's going a little slow. Sorry about that. One second. Yeah, no problem. There we go. Okay. So, the meeting ID is 962-563-9. 962-563? Yep. And then the last three digits are 849. Okay. Joining right now, sir. I'm sorry, one more time, Gary. Yeah, no problem. Let's see, 962-563-849. Awesome. You can just hit mute on the audio at the bottom left, since we're already on the phone, and then click the blue share button at the bottom. Maybe select your entire screen at the top. Usually it's the most helpful. Okay, let me know if you can see the screen. Good, yeah, I can see that. Okay, excellent. So this is what has changed. So if I go over to positions, for example, and let's just say we click this one, go over to the pipeline, This entire pipeline layout got changed from what me and Robin saved. I don't know if we saved it. I don't know if we forgot to save it. We had it on Friday, and for some reason it's not here today. Oh, okay. Yeah, maybe it wasn't saved. If you go back to your main PCR screen up at the top and then go to system in the main menu, perfect. And then use that search bar to type in pipeline setup. There we go, excellent. Select the pipeline setup on the right and then go to craft pipeline on the left. So how do we apply this to the whole team? Okay, so this will be applied to any positions you create moving forward. Any positions that you had already in the database didn't have this applied to it. It's going to use the older pipeline but as you create new positions you'll be able to template to apply to it so it might be the position you pulled up might be created before you made the pipeline template well let me see really quick because we had already created that like robin was showing me it and it was all under this one right here and for some reason this one switched over the weekend like this is the exact one that Robin was working on it may have actually been this one let me just double check oh okay this is probably this is what you're talking about yeah so anything made after the creation of the template will be able to have the new setup for the pipeline okay so if we create a new position like just to verify that this works Yeah, exactly. Perfect. And then you'll get a pop-up right here to choose your pipeline. There you go. So we should be good then. That's good. I don't need to go down that rabbit hole. So then the other thing that I'm trying to figure out is how to hook up people's RingCentrals to their account. So let's do... Okay. And hopefully this doesn't end our meeting, Garrett, but let's sign out. Give me a second. Should be fine. Okay, let's go to RingCentral. And we're going to go ahead and log in. Sign in. Okay, let's go to RingCentral. And we're going to go ahead and log in. Sign in. So, the setup for the integration with PCR, we could start actually in PCRecruiter. I'll kind of show you the steps there. So, go ahead and log in with somebody with admin access, which is probably your own username. And then we're going to do – Oh, sorry. Say that again? Oh, no. What's the next step, sir? Oh no, what's the next step, sir? Then we'll go to System in the main menu up at the top. And go to Users on the left. And then Manage Users on the right. And then select any username that you want to start the connection for. Awesome. And then where it says Contact Phone, right under his full name, go ahead and enter his RingCentral phone number in that space. Okay. This is where I need RingCentral. Oh, gotcha. Okay. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. I want to be able to do this. Okay. Okay, there it is, 602-962-5713. Awesome. Yeah, just paste that in the contact phone right under his full name. 961, what was it? Or 962-5713. Awesome. 962-5713. Awesome. And then hit the little gear icon to the right of that field. Save? Yeah, I would save it. That's a good idea. And I just clicked the gear icon to the right of that field and then select RingCentral at the bottom left. And then enter in that phone number again up in the phone number field at the top. It'll need a specific layout where there's a plus one in front. 602-962-5713. Nice. And then copy that and paste it in the direct dial number, the other field a little bit lower. Desktop phone. We can use the app. we want that to ring central app yeah that has to be pushed to app but yeah also that plus plus one phone number at the top it has to be added to the direct dial number space below okay so I think that we're good you can say so that should be in good shape I would just hit save the little floppy disk at the top right of this screen. That's half of the setup. So the admin does this on this side for each user, then Chase would log into PCR under his username and there's a button to click to sign in. So let's do that real quick because I want to, I can do that. So if I log out here. Okay, cool. Cool. Perfect. If we log back in again. Okay. And then go to MyPCR in the main menu at the top. And then in the bottom frame on the left halfway down it says RingCentral Status in red. Kind of above those, yeah, right there. Click on that and this is where you can sign into the correct account and hit authorize. And now we should be getting the latest batch. Yeah, you should be all set with the RingCentral connection for that user. The user will have to have the RingCentral app installed on their computer, not just like the browser version of RingCentral. They'll need the actual application installed for it to work. Gotcha. And then, so can people make a call directly from here? Yeah. So if you went to like a name record, so go to name in the main menu at the top or yeah, just open anybody. You'll notice to the right of any phone field in the bottom frame there is a phone icon that will start calling. With the on-screen dialer when you click on that Okay, awesome Let me take a screenshot real quick. I'll send this over to One of the guys on our team without me about this yesterday Perfect okay, um excellent and then I'm trying to see so that makes sense Let me see what else we got because we got a couple other questions, I think that answers that that I just have to go in and do that for everybody so basically I can actually I'll send you a email after this with instructions kind of how to do that from our Learning Center so you don't forget anything or get stuck anywhere that I'll just make a note ring central setup article okay cool what What else do you got? Okay. Give me just two seconds here. I got a note. Sure. RingCentral set it back, and then the other one was calling from PCR. Is it possible? Okay. Okay. Cool. Okay. So the next note is – so we figured out the pipeline layout. That's all good. is so we figured out the pipeline layout that's all good PCR capture and capturing resumes how does that work on LinkedIn oh it's so with LinkedIn we don't capture resumes but you do capture the LinkedIn profile you'll need the PCR capture installed on the browser have you installed the capture tool before no never I've never even used it before okay let me see I can I can send you do you want me to just send you the how-to video for the capture tool did that work yes okay let's do PCR capture and as long as you're using either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge it'll be compatible with those browsers and it'll walk you through putting it on the browser and then all the different ways you can capture people but it won't grab resumes there's usually not a resume on LinkedIn and but it does grab a lot of other information from LinkedIn to create a new record. If I go to name and like if I just create a name right so let's say we're creating a name here there's a parse from resume option and that's that right? Oh yeah yeah so that that would be if you have a resume file on your computer you can create the records based on that resume and it'll fill in some of the fields that it automatically grabs from the resume like first name, last name, city, state, title. So yeah, that's definitely a popular feature. Okay, I just made a note of that. And then yeah, PCR capture, we'll just have to set that up at some point. Cool. And you know what, we might actually have just a couple steps that I could send about the parse from resume button there. There might be one, but yeah, it's usually pretty simple, but if I find one, I'll send that along as well, along with the CAPS, I'm sure, info, RingCentral info. Yeah, please do. And then let me just see if there's anything else. So we've dealt with RingCentral. The very last thing, Gary, I'm looking to do is, and thank you for your help, this is so helpful. No problem. Let me just see here. The very last thing is under our roll-ups, like let's just say we look at like one of the roll-ups, for example. So, and we're going to select everybody for this one. Give me just a moment. I don't know why I'm not logging in. Oh, it's because I'm not logged in. It's the right person. Give me a second. Oh, I see. Okay. I was getting nervous, too. I was like, oh, no, what happened to all his roll-ups? No, yeah, okay. Yeah. I'm glad you figured that one out quick. Okay. Sorry, one second here. No problem. Okay. So here's all the records here. If I go over to – let's just say I go over to – I don't know if anybody – give me a second. Okay, let's look at this one for a second. All right. Alright. So with this one right here, is there a way to customize for the entire company a specific layout of columns and the way that this appears? Oh yeah, absolutely. It'll be just for your username. It's like a user-specific layout, but I can show you. You would open up any roll-up list, and this will apply to all roll-up lists. So you already got one open, which is good. Go to the three horizontal lines at the top right, and then look for customize, which is a Or configure, I'm sorry, a gear icon that says configure. Okay. There we go. And here's your layout. These are the different column headers. You can, at the bottom, click on where it says click to set field to add something. You can drag and drop fields to reorder them. And you can just click on a field anywhere, and it'll give you the option to delete it from the layout. Okay, so we probably want to see this a lot different. And there's a way to copy this to all users? Yeah. Yeah, I could show you that too. Okay. So let's just give me like one minute and let me see if I can get a good layout for us. Yeah. That sounds good. Just one moment here, I'm just pulling up the list, the client list. So typically the way we do it is city first, so we're city. You know what, this isn't a good list to look at. Let's do a different list. Okay. okay yeah no problem we do like a better list to look up for us just by being let's just use Texas actually so again Gary it's the right size this column and then it's what was it again customize configure yes it's the gear icon in there okay figure then it's okay so from here we can start doing stuff okay city state is where you that the city's the first thing on seeing so that goes first and then company name and then title And then first name, last name. And phone number. And we don't really want to see this one, so how do I get rid of that? Yeah, you can just click on it. It'll give you the option to delete. Okay, email address is good. We don't want to see this one. Social media, no, we don't really want to see that one. Most people don't even have a LinkedIn it looks like. State's kind of weird in general, so let's just get rid of that one. HQ phone, let's get rid of that one. Postal zip. Yeah, let's get rid of that one. Stage. Is that like, what does stage mean? So that's an advanced feature in roll-ups. A lot of people build roll-ups just to use the stages where you can keep track of where people are in a certain process, like an outreach process. You'd be able to change an icon in the stage column to indicate where people are in your process. Okay, we'll keep that for now. Roll-up rank, we don't really need that. Quick comments. Oh, yeah, that one's kind of an older feature. Quick comments, yeah, kind of an older feature. people don't use that much. Okay, name? Yeah, you already do have the first and last name in there, so you probably wouldn't need name, I don't think. Yeah, Garrett, give me like one second. Sure. Give me like ten minutes on this call, and then we'll get together. Yeah. Okay, sorry, Garrett. No problem. Okay, one more time, Garrett. Yeah, so I think we were just saying that name field is unnecessary because you do have first and last name already listed up above. Okay. Okay. And then stage home. Home phone, just get rid of it. Last activity? That's up to you. Yeah, it just lets you know the date of the last time there was an activity written on the record. I guess we can keep it. What is this activity type? Probably get rid of it. And then activity type is going to show you the activity that was written on the record on the date listed above under last activity. So those kind of go with each other, last activity and activity type. Gotcha. Predefined schedule items, get rid of this, or what is this? Yeah, I would get rid of that. It's kind of an unused feature most of the time. And then we have two custom. If you can see this sheet, we have a field for percentage and then guarantee. Are we able to put that on here somewhere? And that's all. Yeah. yeah so those are related to your placements rather than your name records so you're in a list of name records and right and the name records themselves this is like if we're going to sign people so if we sign people like this is the percent that we sign their company at this is a guarantee so none of this stuff can be can be filled out under this yeah it usually isn't put onto the name records. It's usually put onto like a position record. So when you're filling that job order, you'll know the placement percentage for that position. You could create a custom field on your name records and type in manually on each name what the percentage would be. But names are considered available candidates for all different types of positions. So I don't know if like one name would always have the same percentage based on what position they're being considered for. Does that make sense? Yeah. No, that makes sense. Okay. So then let's just go ahead and save this. And then how do I copy this to everybody? Okay. Yeah. Hit save at the bottom of that pop-up. Awesome. And then go to system in the main menu up at the top. Okay, close. Yeah, you could close. And then system? Yeah, close that. System. Go to users on the left. Copy user settings on the right. Copy user settings on the right. Or right there. There it is. And then select your username in the first dropdown on the left. Is this Nick? That's who you're copying. Yes, that's who you're copying from. And then in the left panel, scroll down until you see Roll-ups list there. There it is. Roll-up list layout is under Roll-up list. Just check that box. And you have all users selected on the right. I would deselect your own name on the right because you're copying from yourself. There we go. And just hit save, and it'll copy to all users. All their roll-ups will have that layout. If I go back to the roles, it should populate. It should show it. Yep. Okay. And I can include instructions for that in case you do want to change that up in the future. Oh, yeah. This is 100,000 times better. Okay. Thank you, Garrett. That should be good for now, man. I'm going to try to get back with the team right now. Thank you so much. No problem. I'll send you an email with some instructions on those other pieces. Let us know if questions come up. Okay, excellent. Thank you so much. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.",

mute on the audio at the bottom left,\n\n41\n00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:15,191\nsince we're already on the phone,\n\n42\n00:02:15,272 --> 00:02:17,378\nand then click the blue share button at the bottom.\n\n43\n00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,838\nMaybe select your entire screen at the top.\n\n44\n00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,599\nUsually it's the most helpful.\n\n45\n00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,895\nOkay, let me know if you can see the screen.\n\n46\n00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,435\nGood, yeah, I can see that.\n\n47\n00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,200\nOkay, excellent.\n\n48\n00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:32,466\nSo this is what has changed.\n\n49\n00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,481\nSo if I go over to positions,\n\n50\n00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:37,865\nfor example,\n\n51\n00:02:37,885 --> 00:02:39,327\nand let's just say we click this one,\n\n52\n00:02:39,347 --> 00:02:39,808\ngo over to the pipeline,\n\n53\n00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:47,880\nThis entire pipeline layout got changed from what me and Robin saved.\n\n54\n00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,018\nI don't know if we saved it.\n\n55\n00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,280\nI don't know if we forgot to save it.\n\n56\n00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,019\nWe had it on Friday, and for some reason it's not here today.\n\n57\n00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,004\nOh, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,614\nYeah, maybe it wasn't saved.\n\n59\n00:03:00,382 --> 00:03:03,831\nIf you go back to your main PCR screen up at the top and then go to system in the\n\n60\n00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,395\nmain menu,\n\n61\n00:03:05,416 --> 00:03:05,576\nperfect.\n\n62\n00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,290\nAnd then use that search bar to type in pipeline setup.\n\n63\n00:03:13,407 --> 00:03:14,151\nThere we go, excellent.\n\n64\n00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,288\nSelect the pipeline setup on the right and then go to craft pipeline on the left.\n\n65\n00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,296\nSo how do we apply this to the whole team?\n\n66\n00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:34,939\nOkay, so this will be applied to any positions you create moving forward.\n\n67\n00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,640\nAny positions that you had already in the database didn't have this applied to it.\n\n68\n00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:59,367\nIt's going to use the older pipeline but as you create new positions you'll be able\n\n69\n00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:04,989\nto template to apply to it so it might be the position you pulled up might be\n\n70\n00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:11,011\ncreated before you made the pipeline template well let me see really quick because\n\n71\n00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:15,572\nwe had already created that like robin was showing me it and it was all under this\n\n72\n0",
