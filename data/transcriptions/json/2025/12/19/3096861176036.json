He just retired and he was looking to see what his options were to kind of discontinue PCR. I could send him your way or send him to your voicemail? I would say, just since it's 5, I would say send him my voicemail if you would. That way I can get his info, call him tomorrow, go over the details, figure out what he wants to do, and get him squared away. That sounds good. All right. Have a great rest of your day. I'll send him to his voicemail. I appreciate it. Thank you, Garrett. Thanks.",
