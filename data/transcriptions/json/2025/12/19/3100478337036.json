    "text": "Thank you for calling MainTechnos Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yes, hi, Tyler. I needed help with PCR to put the portal on my Outlook. It's disappeared. Yeah, not a problem. What company are you with? United Employment Group. Perfect. Yeah, so a lot of times what will happen is that adding can just get disabled. So in Outlook, if you go to File up at the top, left-hand corner, you should, when it opens that File menu, you should see over on the right, it will sometimes be a box that's, like, highlighted in yellow that says, like, Slow or Disabled Com Add-ins. Well, yeah. So just to give you some backstory, My problem is that my computer died yesterday, so I'm logged in, and I had to go in on another computer. And so, unfortunately, Outlook, everything's different. And so to start off with, I'm in Outlook, and when I look over in the left-hand corner, I don't even have file. I have three lines, home, view, and help. Okay, so it sounds like you're using the new Outlook. No, I have it clicked to not use the new Outlook. Okay. Let's hop on the quick screen share then. Okay. So I can take a look here. So let me start up a video meeting. Okay. Now, what's a good email address for you? S Krewach spelled K-R-E-W-A-T-C-H at unitedemploymentgroup.com. All right. All right. Just sent that meeting link on over to you. Okay. Should get it here in just a second. All right. Now, if you see options for connecting with audio and video, you can just exit out of those. and then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share. And you'll want to pick an option under entire screen. You'll click on which screen you want to share, and then you'll hit share again in the pop-out box. Perfect. Alrighty. So let's go ahead and go into Outlook. Can you see it? Yep. So click those three lines up at the top. Okay, so that's just your folders. what are your options that you have over on the left there like those icons okay so we got mail we got calendar we got people we got it to do org explore loop more apps Now, have you downloaded the PCR portal on this computer before? Well, you have to – it has been on this computer for the other – so I'm using another computer because like I said, mine died yesterday, so it's with IT right now. So this one has had PCR. Previously? Yeah, because the guy that was using it before, he's no longer with us, but he was using it. Yes. Okay. So it looks like in the very top right-hand corner, there's a little gear icon. Settings? Yep, go to there. Go to general over on the left. Normally there's just like a file option. Well, files are above it. So that's files. Oh, okay. Okay. go ahead and click on files we'll see what's there oh no all right go ahead and exit out of this for me Click on where it says view settings over in the top left. That's just for mail. Click where it says home up at the top. It's not giving us any way to change those bars in the options. In the search, can you do, just type in file? Oh, that's just all folder search. That's not like a help search. Go to help up at the top. Help, help, help, help. Is it over here? Where's help? It's the top left over next to you and home. To the right, the help. Oh. Running from my face. Okay, so you're not in the classic outlook. I'm not? Nope. See how it says go to classic outlook right there? Oh, I clicked it. Look at the right side. I made sure I turned it off on the right hand side. Yeah, so you're still in the new Outlook app. Oh, that sucks. So hit the go to classic Outlook. There we go. So that button over there doesn't necessarily take you right out of the new Outlook. Because there's a button that turns it on and off over on the right-hand side, and I turned it off, but I guess. Yeah, it's weird. They have different apps for it now. And not to get off the subject, but later on in life, how will we integrate PCR into the new Outlook? Will that be able to happen? Not in the same capacity, probably, because Outlook is changing. The new Outlook doesn't support add-ins of any type. Okay. And so the type of app that we would be able to develop for Outlook would be very limited. okay so go to file go to manage add-ins you that last option on the bottom No, we don't want that. Okay, go ahead and exit out of this. Go ahead and exit out of the webpage one. go to options down at the bottom left of the screen and then go to Adams down in this box okay so it looks like we're gonna have to read I go ahead and scroll down a little bit see if we have it inactive okay we're gonna have to read download the outlook portal so first thing we're gonna do go to where it says general up at the top or it says optimized for best appearance we're gonna optimize that for compatibility Where is it? Under user interface options. Yeah. Okay, click this one? Yep. Okay. Then hit okay. Okay. And then we're going to exit out of Outlook. And then go ahead and open up a new tab on your web page. It's because you have to hit either leave or cancel on that one. Then just go to the website, PCRecruiter.net. nope just PC Recruiter not .net not the whole big long thing PC yep you can just use that first one the PC Recruiter.net, the second one down. Yep. And then click where it says Downloads in those options. And then scroll down just a tad where it says PC Recruiter for Microsoft Outlook, that Download PCR. Yep, click on that little download link. Then we'll wait for it to finish doing its down mode here real quick. Once it's done downloading, you're just going to run that file. Is it going to tell me when it's done downloading? Yep. I'm going to run this file, this PC report? Yep. Okay. username and password I would be probably like it admin username or password for that computer If it doesn't let you, you might have to have your IP do it for you. What I can do is... I think it worked. Oh, perfect. I think it worked. It just went over to the screen anyway. and you should see something about like it installing them go ahead and open that file again so you see enter an admin username I got a feeling you know I obviously I I put my password and everything when I sign into PCR but in my an admin I guess not well no it's not an admin for PC recruiter it's an admin for the computer so it'd be like what you used to sign in on your computer well it should be that that's what I used to sign in on my computer I do just Let's try it again here. requires elevation. Bullshit. Well, boss is down at the end of the hallway, so I have to go down and ask him if you want to... I don't know what it is. Yeah, I can wait for a second if you want to ask him. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Tyler, hold on one second. My boss is going to talk to you, okay? All right. Hold on one second. Are you there? Yep. Hold on a second here. I don't know why it's not working. Here he comes. Okay. This is Mike. Hi, this is Tyler with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good. How are you? Not too bad. Not too bad. Yeah, so we're just running into, we're trying to download the Outlook portal on this new computer for Scott. it just requires an admin username and password for the computer to arrive i mean i gotta i gotta go find that so you're i mean like i'm an admin so i'm assuming is it like any admin i mean we never had to do this before something change or i'm not sure it's what it's a computer setting not a pcr setting oh it's an admin for so this isn't is it's looking for pc recruiters admin or are you talking about admin? No, for admin for the device. I'm going to have to get that from him. All right. Yeah, my computer guys are idiots. So let me, I don't know why they have some of this stuff on here, but I'll have to get it. We'll have to call you back. Okay. Yeah, not a problem. So what I can do is I'm going to email Scott the setup instructions for portal. It's like a step-by-step guide. So once it's installed, just follow those directions and that'll set it up. Okay. And if you run into any issues, you can always give us a call back as well, but just so you have those on hand. Okay. I appreciate it. Yep. So I'll send that over now to Scott, and then if you have any questions, just let us know. All right. Thank you. Yep. Have a great day.",
