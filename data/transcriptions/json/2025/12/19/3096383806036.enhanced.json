    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Vince Brown. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I am good. I don't really need help more than I just need an explanation, or maybe I'm just doing this wrong. So the pipeline, I don't understand the differences between a pipeline when you're in the candidate record versus the pipeline as a standalone. And I'll give you the most recent example. So if I'm in a pipeline within a candidate record and I move a candidate to out of process, then a window pops up and I can choose why and I can put notes in it, right? But if I do it from the pipeline itself, that's no option. So I can't put any notes. It just automatically does it. And then if I go back to review it, I have no idea what the reason would be or anything like that. Okay. So the difference is how you have it set for the drag and drop action. like if you go into your setup for your pipeline setup on each panel whether it's an active or not a process step you can say when I do a drag and drop does it pop up the step or does it drop it in so basically when you're doing it from the name record you're forced you're forced to pop up because we don't have like that same structure where you're dragging it all so if you were to change your step in your pipeline setup to pop up then you would see that same screen. So I could do that from, I can do that, I can change that setting within the pipeline as well. Yeah. So if you go to system, pipeline setup, got it. Yeah. Data base setup, pipeline setup. So for every active and out of process step, what you can do is when you go to, like there's the drag and drop action. Yeah, I see it popping up. Instead of just moving it, it pops it up so you can add a little more detail. Okay, perfect. And then it says this only for client rejected candidate withdrew. Okay, perfect. I just fixed it all. Thank you, dear. Oh, no problem. Have a great week. That was the easiest ticket of the day. Hopefully you too. All righty. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
