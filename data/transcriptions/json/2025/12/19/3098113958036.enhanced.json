    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm a current user of PCR, and I'm having issues with PCR capture. The button's there, but it doesn't do anything when I click it. It kind of acts like it knows I'm clicking it, but nothing goes any further to actually entail the information. in. Got it. So at the top right of your screen, click on the little PCR capture logo to open up the capture menu. At the bottom, there's a few toggles. One of them says basic mode. Is that turned off and to the left? It's on and to the right. Okay. If you turn it off and to the left, it'll stop doing that issue. Basically, when basic mode is on, it captures the person without letting you see any of the information being captured. Gosh, I didn't realize I had to change that maybe. Yeah, so we recommend always keeping that one off. Okay, okay. Let me see if it reloads. Do I need to log out and log back in? No, you should be fine. I would just refresh the LinkedIn profile that you have pulled up, if it's still pulled up, and try again. Let's do update. Yeah, it's acting like it's thinking now. Oh, my gosh, I feel so silly. I don't know how I've turned that off. Oh, no worries. Okay, that's as simple as it gets for you all day. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, anything else you've been noticing off with the capture tool or any problems in PCR? No, not really. Well, actually, now that I have you, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know if it's based on our setup, but when I go to activities, it defaults to only seeing SMS instead of all. Oh, okay. Yeah, you can adjust that for your username. It's kind of your activity default filters. Okay. If you, let's see, pull up activities on any name record. Okay. And then you – oh, sorry. I think my internet connection is going a little bit – can you still hear me all right? Yep, I sure can. Oh, good. Okay. So, yeah, if you have activities pulled up, in the action menu at the top right, there's something called default filters. It's a gear icon. It might not be pinned, though, so you'll probably have to click the three horizontal lines. I'm in the gear configure activity filters, yeah. Awesome, yeah. And if you just at the bottom, make sure that the selected items is emptied out. So you can click on the minus sign next to any selected items. Oh, my gosh. That's changed for our whole team, so I'll share that tidbit. Thank you. No problem. Yeah, just remember to hit save, and that should do it for you. Save, close, yes. Let's see. Oh, I'm glad you asked about anything else. That's beautiful. Thank you so much. Awesome. Well, happy to help you. If you notice anything else, just let us know. Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Bye. Have a good one.",

00:00:17,413\nThe button's there, but it doesn't do anything when I click it.\n\n7\n00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,046\nIt kind of acts like it knows I'm clicking it,\n\n8\n00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:24,294\nbut nothing goes any further to actually entail the information.\n\n9\n00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:26,867\nin.\n\n10\n00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,324\nGot it.\n\n11\n00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,207\nSo at the top right of your screen,\n\n12\n00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:35,119\nclick on the little PCR capture logo to open up the capture menu.\n\n13\n00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,010\nAt the

00:00:43,714\nIt's on and to the right.\n\n17\n00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,444\nOkay.\n\n18\n00:00:45,141 --> 00:00:48,555\nIf you turn it off and to the left, it'll stop doing that issue.\n\n19\n00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:50,361\nBasically,\n\n20\n00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:51,043\nwhen basic mode is on,\n\n21\n00:00:51,124 --> 00:00:54,073\nit captures the person without letting you

00:01:02,895\nYeah, so we recommend always keeping that one off.\n\n25\n00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:04,471\nOkay, okay.\n\n26\n00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:07,600\nLet me see if it reloads.\n\n27\n00:01:08,241 --> 00:01:10,858\nDo I need to log out and log back in?\n\n28\n00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:11,995\nNo, you should be fine.\n\n29\n00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,571\nI would just refresh the LinkedIn profile that you have pulled up,\n\n30\n00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:16,233\nif it's still pulled up,\n\n31\n00:01:16,273 --> 00:01:16,895\nand try again.\n\n32\n00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,394\nLet's do

don't know how I've turned that off.\n\n36\n00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,435\nOh, no worries.\n\n37\n00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,000\nOkay, that's as simple as it gets for you all day.\n\n38\n00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:40,611\nYeah, no problem.\n\n39\n00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:41,921\nYeah,\n\n40\n00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:45,336\nanything else you've been noticing off with the capture tool or any problems in\n\n41\n00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:45,476\nPCR?\n\n42\n00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,926\nNo, not really.\n\n43\n00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,830\nWell,\n\n44\n00:01:48,830 -->

know if it's based on our setup,\n\n48\n00:01:56,174 --> 00:01:58,272\nbut when I go to activities,\n\n49\n00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,420\nit defaults to only seeing SMS instead of all.\n\n50\n00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,180\nOh, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,920\nYeah, you can adjust that for your username.\n\n52\n00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,320\nIt's kind of your activity default filters.\n\n53\n00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,240\nOkay.\n\n54\n00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:18,920\nIf you, let's see, pull up activities on any name record.\n\n55\n00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:19,700\nOkay.\n\n56\n00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,300\nAnd then you – oh, sorry.\n\n57\n00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,011\nI think my internet connection is going a little bit – can you still hear me
