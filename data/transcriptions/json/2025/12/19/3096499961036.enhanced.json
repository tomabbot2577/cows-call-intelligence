    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. I just had a quick question for you. We just recently onboarded someone new to our team, and we're just now noticing that they kind of see things on the PCR dashboard a little bit differently than we do. One of the main differences is they have no way of seeing old notes that were left on certain potential prospects that are in the system. actually just have a section that says private notes and they can't see any of our past notes yeah so private notes is something completely different it's like a spot to only put a note that they would ever see so you want like the regular notes area it sounds like when the username was added that maybe settings from another user were not copied okay okay got it um yeah so some if you could just help me get um those copied so that they're the exact same well there's probably Probably a lot more, yeah, that you'd want to do. So if you go to system, and I'm sorry, what is your name? It's Alexia. And your company? Trusted Human Capital. I'm sorry? Trusted Human Capital. Okay. I think it's under a career building solutions database, and then it's Trusted Human Capital within that database, if that makes sense. All right. Let's see. Why am I not finding you? What's your last name, Alexia? It's Abreu, A-B-R-E-U. Hmm. It should be under Career Building Solutions, and then it says Human Capital within that database, yeah. Gotcha. Okay. So if you want her to have the setting, so when you go to Add a User, at the bottom of that screen there's like a copy settings from since the username is already saved what you're going to want to do is go to system users and then over at the right go to copy user settings okay hold on one second all right so user okay copy user settings got it okay okay so you'll be so if you want her to have your settings what you're going to want to do is go to um the source username drop down so you'll be the source username in other words who to copy from got it and then you'll want to make sure each of those headings are expanded and select what to copy so it sounds like you'll probably want you never want to copy form letters um preferences you could copy it as a starting point but you might want to go through and like tweak some things like if they should not be able like one study we never copy sister administrator but if If you don't want them, like, deleting records or things like that, you'll want to definitely review the securities. Okay. Yeah, you know, we're, gosh, we're a really small team right now. It's only four of us. So I think if I could just have, I mean, no form letters. So I'll do select all, and then I'll deselect form letters. Actually, I didn't even copy that form. Yeah, the only reason you'd want to copy form letters, if you're really copying it over to another database from you as you, because you don't want to have two letters with the same name. Okay, perfect. And then under where it says like the name, company, position, records, this is just the same format basically of how I see things, they'll see things now. Correct. Yeah, that first column copies your search preference as well as the record layout. Okay, great. And then the one in the middle for cards, yeah, the one in the middle for cards is more like that recently viewed. Gotcha, gotcha. Okay, I think I'm going to just have him see everything that I see. It's pretty standard for what we would like for him. And he can have some of the other, like be able to delete a name record if he needed. So I'm going to go ahead and copy that. And then I would just go ahead and click the username and press save then once I pick which person I want to copy those settings to. Yeah, over at the right. Yeah, that would just double check those securities just in case. Okay, okay. Definitely will. All right, perfect. That was easy enough. Awesome. Yeah, that same screen is at the bottom of the add new user screen, but sometimes people don't have it expanded that they kind of overlook it. So that might help. Gotcha. Okay, perfect. Thank you so, so much. I appreciate it. You are welcome. Have a good week. Have a great week. Yes, you as well. Thank you. Bye.",

Robin.\n\n4\n00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,155\nI just had a quick question for you.\n\n5\n00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,164\nWe just recently onboarded someone new to our team,\n\n6\n00:00:11,244 --> 00:00:14,370\nand we're just now noticing that they kind of see things on the PCR dashboard a\n\n7\n00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,472\nlittle bit differently than we do.\n\n8\n00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,127\nOne of the main differences is they have no way of seeing old notes that were left\n\n9\n00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:24,991\non certain potential prospects that are in the system.\n\n10\n00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,783\nactually just have a section that says private notes and they can't see any of our\n\n11\n00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:40,647\npast notes yeah so private notes is something completely different it's like a spot\n\n12\n00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:49,432\nto only put a note that they would ever see so you want like the regular notes area\n\n13\n00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:55,456\nit sounds like when the username was added that maybe settings from another user\n\n14\n00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:58,017\nwere not copied okay okay got it um yeah so some if you could just help me get um\n\n15\n00:00:58,138 --> 00:01:00,739\nthose copied so that they're the exact same well there's probably Probably a lot\n\n16\n00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:01,039\nmore, yeah,\n\n17\n00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:01,720\nthat you'd want to do.\n\n18\n00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,297\nSo if you go to system, and I'm sorry, what is your name?\n\n19\n00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:05,186\nIt's Alexia.\n\n20\n00:01:08,484 --> 00:01:09,635\nAnd your company?\n\n21\n00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:11,758\nTrusted Human Capital.\n\n22\n00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:12,725\nI'm

database,\n\n26\n00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:22,533\nand then it's Trusted Human Capital within that database,\n\n27\n00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:23,736\nif that makes sense.\n\n28\n00:01:26,526 --> 00:01:26,859\nAll right.\n\n29\n00:01:27,248 --> 00:01:27,498\nLet's see.\n\n30\n00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:36,734\nWhy am I not finding you?\n\n31\n00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,175\nWhat's your last name, Alexia?\n\n32\n00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,148\nIt's Abreu, A-B-R-E-U.\n\n33\n00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:46,589\nHmm.\n\n34\n00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,467\nIt should be under Career Building Solutions,\n\n35\n00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:52,614\nand then it says Human Capital within that database,\n\n36\n00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:53,175\nyeah.\n\n37\n00:01:55,309 --> 00:01:55,479\nGotcha.\n\n38\n00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:55,760\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:59,131\nSo if you want her to have the setting,\n\n40\n00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,240\nso when you go to Add a User,\n\n41\n00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:06,535\nat the bottom of that screen there's like a copy settings from since the username\n\n42\n00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:12,027\nis already saved what you're going to want to do is go to system users and then\n\n43\n00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:16,784\nover at the right go to copy user settings okay hold on one second all right so\n\n44\n00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:21,099\nuser okay copy user settings got it okay okay so you'll be so if you want her to\n\n45\n00:02:21,148 --> 00:02:26,247\nhave your settings what you're going to want to do is go to um the source username\n\n46\n00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:30,955\ndrop down so you'll be the source username in other words who to copy from got it\n\n47\n00:02:31,053 --> 00:02:36,839\nand then you'll want to make sure each of those headings are expanded and select\n\n48\n00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:41,301\nwhat to copy so it sounds like you'll probably want you never want to copy form\n\n49\n00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,302\nletters um preferences you could copy it as a starting point but you might want to\n\n50\n00:02:46,352 --> 00:02:50,618\ngo through and like tweak some things like if they should not be able like one\n\n51\n00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:54,884\nstudy we never copy sister administrator but if If you don't want them,\n\n52\n00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:55,227\nlike,\n\n53\n00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:57,826\ndeleting records or things like that,\n\n54\n00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:01,111\nyou'll want to definitely review the securities.\n\n55\n00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,520\nOkay.\n\n56\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,480\nYeah, you know, we're, gosh, we're a really small team right now.\n\n57\n00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,500\nIt's only four of us.\n\n58\n00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:12,340\nSo I think if I could just have, I mean, no form letters.\n\n59\n00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,420\nSo I'll do select all, and then I'll deselect form letters.\n\n60\n00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,920\nActually, I didn't even copy that form.\n\n61\n00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,308\nYeah,\n\n62\n00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:21,080\nthe only reason you'd want to copy form letters,\n\n63\n00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,084\nif you're really copying it over to another database from you as y",
