    "text": "Thank you for calling me. Hello. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett, Alyssa at HC Pursuit. How are you? Good. How are you? I am all right. Actually, I'm working from home, kind of not really working, recovering from surgery I had on Monday. but I figured while I'm away from my desk, I can ask questions. It popped up on Facebook about the AI match. And so we did the re-indexing of the database so we could do some other AI thingy. Steve said he didn't see the AI match. I don't know if he went to the right spot. I guess my question is, do we have it? Is there something else we need to do? What's the story on that? Yeah, the procedure would be having your PCR contract signer, Steve, reach out and say that they want the AI match turned on as part of your AI free trial. And then we will have to reindex your database again, but you shouldn't notice any changes or differences as we're doing that. so you can use PCR normally, and then we will install the tool, the AI candidate match. All right. Turn on candidate match. All right. Terrific. Let me let him know that he needs to reach out to you all to effect that, and we'll go from there. Awesome. Yeah, that sounds good. And if any other questions come up around that, just let us know. not at this moment, but I will let him know that he needs to, does he need to email you guys or what does he need to do? Sure. You could just send a email to support at main sequence.net. Okay. All right. Perfect. I will, I'll let him know to do that forthwith. Thank you so much. Awesome. All right. Thank you so much. Have a great rest of your day. Thanks. You too.",
