    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Josh Bocek. I work with STSI. We do leverage your product, GC Recruiter, that is. And we're trying to extract the resumes from the database, but it seems like the resumes are kind of parsed in different sections, and then the system kind of builds it maybe on the fly, if I understand that correctly? You know what? I'm not really sure. Well, with you being still hosted on your servers, right? That is correct, yes. Okay. I am not really sure exactly how it's done there because normally when it's on our servers, we have to provide a database backup. I don't know if he'd be available right now, but can I create a ticket and have one of our server administrators reach out to you? That would be amazing, yes. Okay, because I'm sorry, I just don't know how to, I don't want to have access to your servers. I don't even have access to ours. To give you advice on that, that's kind of done at the high level. Because they're probably in a folder on the server. Okay. Let's see. yeah any help would be appreciated robin so thank you so much for for helping me here okay and then what is the best number to reach you 630-518-6995. Oh, wait a minute. Okay. 630, apparently I'm typing slower today, 518-6995. 6995. Okay. And you want to download all resumes? That is correct, yeah. We want to download the resumes and put them in a different system, but we just haven't been able to figure out how to do it. Well, I shouldn't say that. We don't have the experts. No one in our internal IT knows where to look, so we're reaching out to you as the expert to help us to hopefully look in the right direction. Okay. Yeah, I will have him reach out on that, and give you some advice. I really appreciate it, Robyn. I hope you have an amazing rest of your day. You too. Thank you. Thank you. All right, bye.
