So just wanted to see if you talked to Jim and if I can just sign these papers. Jim hasn't been available today. He's been in meetings, but he is aware I sent over an email. There would just be a process. He'd have to get in contact with David and have David sign something giving you permission so that in the future you would just be listed as a primary contact. Got it. So, yeah, we will start that process as soon as Jim frees up today. But in the meantime, I did send an email to the J. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So hopefully it will work for the password reset part of it. Okay. But I guess you can tell Jim it makes no sense. Like I already signed these forms. Sorry. It's just like process. So I already signed these forms to get all the data like four months ago. Like I own the data. I don't know. Maybe you could have him call. yeah we'll have him reach out yeah for sure just to kind of clear up any questions and get everything set correctly on our side so you don't have to run into this in the future okay thank you thanks a lot have a good one thanks",
