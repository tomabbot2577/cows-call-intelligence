    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. How are you today? Good. How are you? Hey, two quick questions for you. One sounds remedial, and I have to apologize. My brain's just not working today. I'm trying to... I know I have form letters within my PCR. How do I create a new form letter and attach it to a bunch of people's names. So can you walk me through that real fast, like form letters? Sure. So you would just go to System in the main menu at the top of PCR. Then go to Form Letters on the left. Yep. And then go to Name Letters on the right. Yep. And then in the bottom frame, you'll see in the Action menu, there's a plus sign to create a new form letter. I can't find that. I'm looking for it. That's what I'm looking for. I don't care. Oh, okay. I'm looking for it. It says names and it says I want to. It'll say I want to. It'll say format I want to name last modified. Usually, where's the plus sign? So it's usually at the top right of the frame. If you didn't pin the action button, the plus sign yet, you'd click the three horizontal lines to see your drop-down menu. Okay. It says add letter. Jesus goodness. There we are. Add a letter. There it is. Awesome. And you just give the letter a name up at the top, and then below you create your form letter. Is there like an AI function? Like within LinkedIn, you have an AI function that rewrites stuff for you. Does PCR have that yet? I think you don't have that function. Yeah. So we have released to all of our customers a free trial of the AI features. So it's going to be in your database currently. It's the AI email generator. So you would want to use that toolbar above the big blank space. All the way to the right, there's an AI generator button. It's kind of like a hexagon in purple. Yep. I see it. Yep. If you click on that, it'll give you some prompts to kind of figure out what type of letter you want to create. and you just kind of follow those prompts. You can even enter in extra information in the bar at the bottom that you want it to reference or include. And then you can click on Use This Text once it generates an email for you. Yeah, so at the very bottom, I typed in, like, a letter I had, and it just popped up. It says, First, select the tone of voice you'd like to keep your email, and put casual. It says casual on that. You can type in different modes. It's not letting me hit casual. And it says, who are the recipients, job applicants, or referrals? I put job applicants. It says it's not letting me hit that. It says you can casual, friendly. How do you click on it? Once you click on it, that's where it's coming up with the second prompt. So once you clicked on casual, then it asks you who are the recipients, Yep, I did that. We were sent the job applicants, and then it says, what's the purpose? Initial contact. I got you. As you click your answer, it asks you the next question, and then it'll eventually build the form letter after it asks you all the questions. got this is it says I can regenerate or use this text you know so it says use this text I can use it as is so it says like AI dot-dot exciting opportunity I don't want to do that I want to get rid of the AI dot-dot would that get rid of itself when I do that or how does that work so when you hit use this text it'll go back to the screen where you're able to build your form letters It will have inserted that text there, and we definitely recommend tweaking and adjusting whatever the AI came up with. Yeah, because if you're a job applicant, I don't want to do that. So I'll just – Right. How do I populate everyone's names? Is there a way to, like, auto-populate their name, like with some kind of code like LinkedIn does? There's no way to do that. Yeah, absolutely. It's called an insert field. So you just want to put your cursor wherever you want that little code to be inserted and click on insert fields in the toolbar all the way to the right at the top. And then here, like deer, like a set of deer, you just want their name. So it's the insert field. I'll hit that and hit one. So what am I going to put in there? Type. Yeah, backspace the system print thing that it has to just start typing the word first. and it'll show you results of fields that you can reference. So it'll come up with name, period, first name. That's telling you it's the name record, first name field that it'll reference. Yep. Perfect. And then it'll insert it. First name will come up. It says, I hope you find it. Well, I'm reaching out. Then it says, best regards, insert your name and signature here. So it's in the bottom, insert your name and signature. What is that? It's just like that pop. I'm not sure why that's there. You'll remove that insert your name that the AI came up with, the signature part and you can put an insert field in there just put your cursor down there click on insert fields again yeah and uh this time just start typing the word signature in that little pop-up window and you'll find system current user email signature yep yep insert yep it says system current users that means this message will come up i can almost send this entire message in my entire database almost and so here's a question i got this letter and i'm going to call this letter So up top, it's going to be called – I'll make a name for this. So again, thank you for helping me with this. My ACD. Sure. ACD, copy, roll, or I'm just going to cut and paste this. Hold on. I have it in another area. So I'm going to do this. Boom. I got this. Copy. I'm going to put it up top. Boom. Paste. So I got the name. I got it in there. I have the form letters. I have all this stuff. It looks just like I like. So now what do I do? So then you just hit save at the bottom right, and that will save your form letter. You can then go to a roll-up list and select all. I haven't done this in a while. So say we go to a roll-up list. I go to – I make a name up. I'm going to go to everyone who has – it's like for copy supervisors. Anyone who has copy in their title, I'm going to go to. So I go here, and I go to titles, I guess, right? I go to company name. Hold on. How am I getting that? Type title. And I just put the word copy. So I'm going to say if anyone has the word copy in their title, it's going to show up. Now we hit copy. And now we hit search. And now I see, like, one of six, and there's, like, results 107. So if I want to hit all 107, there's, like, six 107. That's all I'm going to do more than that. But all right, just copy. I'll do it 10 different ways. So you would just do select at the top left of your search results and select all results. And that would let you use your action buttons again at the top right. There would be a letter icon there to send a bulk email right from your search results, or you can put them on a roll-up list. So it says right here, I hit select all, then it says basic results, and it says now where do I hit the – how do I copy the letter in there? How do I do that? What do I do? That's going to be in your action menu. So that's the icons, the handful of icons that end with the three horizontal lines, usually at the top right of the frame. That's your action menu. Okay, so top right, it'll say, I'm saying, so in here it says basic advance. It has the three lines. Or it has results. It has, like, it looks like a question mark, a letter. Yeah, those ones, the question mark, the letter. that's your action menu so you uh the letter is a little letter so go so yeah okay so hit letter hit letter now it's going to say click letter this list says click to select letter form and it's saying go to that letter i just did obviously the one i just did so i'm going to click that so i just call the acd copy there it is so i hit that so i hit that that's in there says to select set of names. I just already highlighted. Are they already in there? That's good. They're already in there. That's good. No, they're not in there. How do I get them in there? I hit select on the left. They're not in here, though. When I did this, I don't see them. When it says selected set of names, it means that it's going to send to your names that you selected before. So it's already plugged in, ready to go. Gotcha. And it says primary email address from the title, blah, blah, blah, and it says email category, please select the category. Announcements, benefits, do I need to put that in there? Is that something I need to do? Yeah, it'll require you to select a category in case anybody has unsubscribed from one of those categories. And if they do, PCR will block that from sending out. So just like networking. So I'm doing networking. Hit networking. It says flag. It says return receipt. And put normal priority. If I hit that, that'll send a message to those 100 people or whatever I have in there, correct? Yeah, the return receipt and the priority don't really apply too much in the modern email inboxes. Some don't even kind of respect those settings anymore, but feel free to turn them on. But you could preview and then send the email out. It'll go out to that. Yeah, so I'm going to hit preview. It says, boom, a name came up, and it should blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and it previewed your domain. Guys, see the preview. Now I get back at a preview. Okay, I just get ready for the preview. Now I can go in. It says preview, send, close. I hit send right now. It's going to send all those people that I selected. I'm going to hit send. It's a bulk mail. It's just composing. It says one of 101, one, two, three. Okay, it's starting to send. Now it's going to send anyone who has an email. I have an email address for. It's going to send that message to and just kick back. Yeah, it'll send to. You selected the primary email address field. So as long as their email address is inside this field called email address, it will be sending to them. But if you store their email in something like a field called email work or whatever, you would have to designate that that's the field you want to send to as you're creating it. But most of the time, it's just primary email address is the best bet, which is what you did. Yeah, it says if the screen stops clicking. So here it says 60 is composing email, 70 of 101 email sent, 42. Gotcha. The email is 80 of 40, 80 of 101. Email sent 49. So it's just sending email. It's randomly sending email now to my database. Yeah, I just want to send it to my database. Gotcha. Okay. Now it says 101. So it's email sent 54. So it's still saying, why did it only send, it says compose the email, 101 of 101. Email sent 54. It only sent 54 of 101. It's invalid email. It's 47 of them. Okay. That's interesting. Why would they be invalid? It might be that they don't have an email address in the email field, email address field, that it wouldn't have anything to send to. So let me see what the field looks like. So I go to like a typical person. My email looks like email, email other. Okay, so this person probably didn't have an email. If I didn't have that person's email in there, they're not going to get it. That makes sense. If I didn't add that for some reason, that's my bad, you're saying. That makes sense. Gotcha. Okay. I think I got it. I might need to call back later, but I think I got it. I can just go in and randomly hit up people, who knows what, gotcha. And just like I said, I just want to start sending more bulk stuff out. But this is great. Thank you. You were wonderful. Let me send you, I'll send you an email with those instructions in case you need them. Again, how to create form letters, how to send bulk mail. I would just definitely be careful. We are still using whatever email provider. We just connect to your email provider. So if they have limits on how many emails you can send per hour or per day, just make sure you kind of pay attention to that so you don't get started. Gotcha. I get that. And then the other thing, here's another question. You said the AI thing. Is that the trial? So I didn't even know I had that. How long is my trial for that? The management hasn't really decided a date to end the AI-free trial. We're just going to let it float and see how long it goes. But, yeah, feel free to use that as much as you need to. and eventually we'll notify you if we're about to turn it off, give you the option of purchasing it. But, yeah, you should be able to choose. So what does it do? So what does the AI thing do typically? What's the big benefit of it? So if I want to go into AI, let's go back to that again. How do I get to that AI function? I just sent these emails. I go back to, like, schedule, I'm in my PCR. Where's the AI function, and how do I get back to that? So that was back under system up in the main menu at the top. and then form letters on the left and then name letters on the right. And then in the bottom frame, you were clicking the add letter or the plus sign to start a new letter. And then that AI button is in the toolbar at the top, and it'll open up that window where it gives you a few questions to answer, and then it can generate. So go back again. So go into form letters. Once I'm in form letters, I'm clicking name letters, you're saying, correct? Is that what we're saying? Right. Yep. Got many name letters. Bottom frame, you're looking for that action menu again. It's going to be at the top right for... Actions. Yes, it's actions. It says add letter, default, hit add letter there. And then once you go to add letter, I see that AI generous. That's really the only place that's really working for me is within there. Yeah, there are a couple other features. I can send you like a video, an article that goes over some of the features you have. The free trial includes AI email generator that we just looked at, as well as the AI job description generator and the AI candidate summary generator. Gotcha. Okay. I can give you a video on that. Okay, that sounds good. Please send it to me. You're a great man. This is great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else. Have a beautiful day. You too.",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:07,114\nHey, Garrett.\n\n5\n00:00:07,505 --> 00:00:08,098\nHow are you today?\n\n6\n00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:08,968\nGood.\n\n7\n00:00:09,246 --> 00:00:09,560\nHow are you?\n\n8\n00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:12,459\nHey, two quick questions for you.\n\n9\n00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:15,220\nOne sounds remedial, and I have to apologize.\n\n10\n00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,551\nMy brain's just not working today.\n\n11\n00:00:17,842 --> 00:00:18,659\nI'm trying to...\n\n12\n00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:22,774\nI know I have form letters within my PCR.\n\n13\n00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,614\nHow do I create a new form letter and attach it to a bunch of people's names.\n\n14\n00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,597\nSo can you walk me through that real fast, like form letters?\n\n15\n00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:34,071\nSure.\n\n16\n00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,473\nSo you would just go to System in the main menu at the top of PCR.\n\n17\n00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,135\nThen go to Form Letters on the left.\n\n18\n00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,585\nYep.\n\n19\n00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:45,337\nAnd then go to Name Letters on the right.\n\n20\n00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:46,767\nYep.\n\n21\n00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,208\nAnd then in the bottom frame,\n\n22\n00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:50,931\nyou'll see in the Action menu,\n\n23\n00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,697\nthere's a plus sign to create a new form letter.\n\n24\n00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:54,788\nI can't find that.\n\n25\n00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:56,398\nI'm looking for it.\n\n26\n00:00:56,602 --> 00:00:57,438\nThat's what I'm looking for.\n\n27\n00:00:57,621 --> 00:00:57,914\nI don't care.\n\n28\n00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,414\nOh, okay.\n\n29\n00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:00,167\nI'm looking for it.\n\n30\n00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,910\nIt says names and it says I want to.\n\n31\n00:01:05,902 --> 00:01:06,535\nIt'll say I want to.\n\n32\n00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:09,217\nIt'll say format I want to name last modified.\n\n33\n00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,918\nUsually, where's the plus sign?\n\n34\n00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,731\nSo it's usually at the top right of the frame.\n\n35\n00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,525\nIf you didn't pin the action button,\n\n36\n00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:18,006\nthe plus sign yet,\n\n37\n00:01:18,026 --> 00:01:20,933\nyou'd click the three horizontal lines to see your drop-down menu.\n\n38\n00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:24,983\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:26,292\nIt says add letter.\n\n40\n00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,698\nJesus goodness.\n\n41\n00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:28,360\nThere we are.\n\n42\n00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:28,900\nAdd a letter.\n\n43\n00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:29,315\nThere it is.\n\n44\n00:01:30,309 --> 00:01:30,499\nAwesome.\n\n45\n00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,505\nAnd you just give the letter a name up at the top,\n\n46\n00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,793\nand then below you create your form letter.\n\n47\n00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,970\nIs there like an AI function?\n\n48\n00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,737\nLike within LinkedIn, you have an AI function that rewrites stuff for you.\n\n49\n00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,387\nDoes PCR have that yet?\n\n50\n00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:50,435\nI think you don't have that function.\n\n51\n00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,327\nYeah.\n\n52\n00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:55,455\nSo we have released to all of our customers a free trial of the AI features.\n\n53\n00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,579\nSo it's going to be in your database currently.\n\n54\n00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,051\nIt's the AI email generator.\n\n55\n00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:04,451\nSo you would want to use that toolbar above the big blank space.\n\n56\n00:02:07,421 --> 00:02:09,776\nAll the way to the right, there's an AI generator button.\n\n57\n00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,240\nIt's kind of like a hexagon in purple.\n\n58\n00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:12,512\nYep.\n\n59\n00:02:13,028 --> 00:02:13,360\nI see it.\n\n60\n00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:13,588\nYep.\n\n61\n00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,762\nIf you click on that,\n\n62\n00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:18,452\nit'll give you some prompts to kind of figure out what type of letter you want to\n\n63\n00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:18,853\ncreate.\n\n64\n00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:23,160\nand you just kind of follow those prompts.\n\n65\n00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,369\nYou can even enter in extra information in the bar at the bottom that you want it\n\n66\n00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,091\nto reference or include.\n\n67\n00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,928\nAnd then you can click on Use This Text once it generates an email for you.\n\n68\n00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:38,941\nYeah,\n\n69\n00:02:38,981 --> 00:02:39,544\nso at the very bottom,\n\n70\n00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:39,765\nI typed in,\n\n71\n00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:39,885\nlike,\n\n72\n00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:40,529\na letter I had,\n\n73\n00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:41,273\nand it just popped up.\n\n74\n00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,101\nIt says,\n\n75\n00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:43,483\nFirst,\n\n76\n00:02:43,643 --> 00:02:46,234\nselect the tone of voice you'd like to keep your email,\n\n77\n00:02:46,254 --> 00:02:46,595\nand put casual.\n\n78\n00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,547\nIt says ",
