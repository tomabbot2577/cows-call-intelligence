    "text": "Thank you for calling MainSegments Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My PCR is being really funky. For example, I cannot load notes. I just tried deleting somebody's file and I'm an admin and it won't let me. So something, I don't know if it's something that needs to be cleared out or if there was an update but um sure yeah it might be a clear cache I'll give you some instructions for that so just pull up PCR on the screen to start and then are you on a Google Chrome browser or I am okay good click the three dots at the top right of the browser yep go down to more tools towards the bottom yep and And then developer tools. Got it. That'll open up some coding and jargon. Just kind of ignore all of that. And then go up to the top of the screen to your web address, the www. Right-click on the refresh button to the left of that. So it's the arrow and a loop. Yeah. And then you should have the option to empty cache and hard reload when you right-click on it. so it's reload site, cancel or reload? Let's see. Did I do that right? No. I think you might have left clicked on it. Hit cancel on that pop-up you just saw, and then try right clicking on the refresh button, and you should get a drop-down to choose empty cache and hard reload. Got it. I see it. Sorry. Perfect. Yeah, no worries. Empty cache and hard reload, the third option, and that would... Oh, and then you'll get a pop-up saying, do you want to reload PCR? And do reload, obviously. Perfect. And that'll kind of slowly reload the page. And once that happens and it's fully loaded, you can close those developer tools. And then we'll see if you're still having that issue. Okay. It's circling. Okay. Okay, now it logs me out. And now it's loading. So I can close that funky window, right? Log back in. Perfect. Okay, hold on. And let's see what happens. Casey Phoenix. Hold on. What's this go to? So I'm just going to see if I can delete this guy now. That was one thing that I knew I couldn't do. Delete record. Do you want to delete? Okay, so now that worked. And let me just go to notes and see if it will populate. Okay, I think I'm fixed. Excellent. All right, thank you. Yep, reach out if you need anything else. Will do. Thanks so much. Thanks. Bye.",
