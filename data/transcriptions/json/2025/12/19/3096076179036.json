    "text": "Hi, this is Sandy. Hi, Sandy. This is Robin Mantoni. How are you? I'm fine, Robin. How are you? Good. I'm calling from Main Sequence about your card. I'm giving you a call back. I'm still trying to figure out how this happened, but anyway. Yeah, it's showing. Okay, let me see. Let me look at the card here. Now, I can only see the last four numbers. It's saying it expired in August of 2025. So the only thing that I can really do is delete this. and then add it again. It doesn't let me just change the expiration date because I can't see all the numbers. It doesn't let me just edit. So let me go ahead and take care of this for you. Hold on one second. So you need the whole number, I guess. Yeah, I got to kind of just do it over. See? I'm trying to figure out how this happened. Yeah, it's got an expiration date of 0825. They issued me a new card. They never said it expired. anyway all right so i'm going to delete this card okay so that's out okay i'm going to add a new one what is the name on the card so it's meredith bishop m-e-r-e-d-i-t-h okay and then the card number? 5524 8690 0250 2734. Okay. And then the expiration? Expires 08 slash 30. Okay. Okay. And the three-digit security number on the back? 937. Okay. Is the address associated with the card 3553 Westchester Pike, Suite 314, Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, 19073? Let's change that. Okay. That's a postal box. Oh, okay. Yeah, let me just give you my... Yeah, it's got to be the one associated with the card for this. Yeah, okay. So my office mailing address is 856 Milmar Road, M-I-L-M-A-R. Okay, road, okay. Newtown Square, Newtown is one word. Got it. Pennsylvania. Okay. It says 1-9-0-7-3. Okay. Let me add that. And then, okay, so the card is stored. Okay. AutoPay is turned on. Now, do you want me to update the address for the invoice itself for going forward? sure let me see what I have for that I mean you send the invoice via email anyway right yeah but still let me have that in there also for tax purposes sure I'm sitting here realizing I've got all these other companies on this credit card. I've got to go fix them all. Jeez. Okay, so it's only the address line that changed, right? Yep. Okay. Well, the address and the expiration date. Yeah, but like the city-state zip was still the same. All right, so your next invoice will have the right address on it. for the one that is open I'll go ahead and try to process this auto pay make sure it goes through it does take a moment I'm going to assume it's going to be fine what it'll do is it'll send you an emailed receipt to Sandy at the Bishop Group if for some reason it doesn't go through I'll just give you a call back because it takes like five minutes for me to tell if it actually went through All right. You should be all set, all right? Sounds like I should be. Thanks, Robin. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. Bye now. Thanks. Bye.",

--> 00:00:04,630\nHow are you?\n\n5\n00:00:05,885 --> 00:00:06,231\nI'm fine, Robin.\n\n6\n00:00:06,904 --> 00:00:07,195\nHow are you?\n\n7\n00:00:07,824 --> 00:00:07,911\nGood.\n\n8\n00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,297\nI'm calling from Main Sequence about your card.\n\n9\n00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,330\nI'm giving you a call back.\n\n10\n00:00:14,943 --> 00:00:17,018\nI'm still trying to figure out how this happened, but anyway.\n\n11\n00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,149\nYeah, it's showing.\n\n12\n00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:19,479\nOkay, let me see.\n\n13\n00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,415\nLet me look at the card here.\n\n14\n00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,816\nNow, I can only see the last four numbers.\n\n15\n00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:24,832\nIt's saying it expired in August of 2025.\n\n16\n00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:28,618\nSo the only thing that I can really do is delete this.\n\n17\n00:00:29,384 --> 00:00:30,919\nand then add it again.\n\n18\n00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,456\nIt doesn't let me just change the expiration date because I can't see all the\n\n19\n00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:34,677\nnumbers.\n\n20\n00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:36,360\nIt doesn't let me just edit.\n\n21\n00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,814\nSo let me go ahead and take care of this for you.\n\n22\n00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,250\nHold on one second.\n\n23\n00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:42,354\nSo you need the whole number, I guess.\n\n24\n00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:45,279\nYeah, I got to kind of just do it over.\n\n25\n00:00:46,402 --> 00:00:46,575\nSee?\n\n26\n00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,915\nI'm trying to figure out how this happened.\n\n27\n00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,313\nYeah, it's got an expiration date of 0825.\n\n28\n00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,230\nThey issued me a new card.\n\n29\n00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:57,256\nThey never said it expired.\n\n30\n00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,104\nanyway all right so i'm going to delete this card okay so that's out okay i'm going\n\n31\n00:01:03,124 --> 00:01:06,808\nto add a new one what is the name on the card so it's meredith bishop\n\n32\n00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:08,450\nm-e-r-e-d-i-t-h okay and then the card number?\n\n33\n00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:32,044\nOkay.\n\n34\n00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:33,909\nAnd then the expiration?\n\n35\n00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:36,188\nExpires 08 slash 30.\n\n36\n00:01:39,135 --> 00:01:39,339\nOkay.\n\n37\n00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:39,560\nOkay.\n\n38\n00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,894\nAnd the three-digit security number on the back?\n\n39\n00:01:43,360 -->
