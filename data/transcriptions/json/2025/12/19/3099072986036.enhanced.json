We have one of our employees who is trying to log into a database, but it is not prompting with the boxes for his username and database and password. We're just wondering if there was maybe a glitch somewhere or if there's something we need to do on our end to fix this. Yeah, so he might just need to clear his browser cache. Okay. Does this user leave their computer on overnight a lot? I have no idea. Okay. It's a remote, so maybe. Gotcha. So, yeah, in the top right-hand corner of that person's browser, they'll click the three dots, go to Delete Browsing Data. Right. And then they'll go to Advanced. they'll set their time range to all time and then the only box they'll want to have checked is cached images and files the cash okay all right perfect i will have them try that thank you thank you so much for your help i appreciate it yeah and then once they hit delete data they just go back to the login page and just refresh the page perfect okay thanks yep no problem have a great day",
