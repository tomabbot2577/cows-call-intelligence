    "text": "I can barely hear you Tyler you sound like you're in a tunnel can you hear me okay is that better that is much better okay I was like I think he said Tyler how are you not too bad and yourself I'm good I'm good this is Rochelle I'm with Symbio and we have we are going fully remote here we're a small company and we moved to a remote desktop and I'm sure it's something simple. I've called you guys about this before, but I don't recall how to do it, but I realized it's not, even though it says it, I logged out of my PCR and logged back in to authenticate RingCentral. So it would pull text. And also I think it's pulling text. Okay, but like my email, my Outlook, it quit pulling those. And I think it's a quick fix, but I don't recall how to do it. So I was going to see if you could take a look because I want to make sure it's pulling everything from my Outlook over to PCR. Yeah, let me take a look. What's your username for the database? R-A-G-U-I-L-E-R-A. One more time for me. R-A-G-U-I-L-E-R-A. Perfect. Let me pop in here and take a look. and I even have, I know you guys always want like an example, so I have someone that I emailed early this morning, and it still hadn't pulled if you needed a reference point. Now, on this remote desktop, are you using the installed classic version of Outlook? I don't know the answer to that, but I have been using that, and I like it, and I've never had an issue, so is that an issue? No, that's what you need for the PCR Outlook portal if that's what you were using before was the add-in that was like inside of your outlook where you can like also like parse the resumes and things like that maybe the add-in is not on my outlook since we switched over this has all happened in the last like couple days like it's been a whole thing trying to get everything switched over so um but your outlook looks the same as it was before though like the classic installed version on that remote desktop Yes. I mean, it's what I've always used. Like, it's tried to do the new version over the last couple months and not always go back to the original. So, yes, it should be the classic. Yes. Perfect. So, what I'm going to do is, since that is like an installed program, if it's like a new remote desktop and you haven't installed the portal yet, you probably don't have it. Okay. So, it's something that simple. Okay. Yep. So what I'm going to do here is I did reinstall it last week when I was doing all this with our new IT guy. So I assumed it was on here, but obviously he doesn't really understand. I think we were looking more at PCR capture maybe, and we didn't look at the – to make sure the add-on was on the Outlook is what I'm thinking. That very well could be. So what I'm going to do – Let me find it here. Because another thing you guys have done for me in the past, too, is backdate it to make sure it's pulling. that aren't, emails aren't missed, I guess, to pull anything that maybe didn't come over in the last month or days. So since this is a new install, you'll be fine. It'll do a full sync on it. Okay. So let me just find I have the step-by-step instructions here. If this page decides it won't float for me... me. Well, this is running a little slow for me on my end. What I'll do, just so I'm not wasting too much of your time, in the next couple minutes here, just look out for an email from me. It's going to be those step-by-step instructions on how to download, install, and log into the portal, so that way it catches up all the other activities for you. Okay. Okay. If you run into any issues, you can always give us a call back. Okay. Perfect. They're just updating something on our office server side where it's going to just take a minute for me to get in there and send it to you. Okay. Yep. I'll be on the lookout and I'll try to follow this step by step. And if I have any issues, I will let you know. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. Yep. No problem. All right.",

much better okay I was like I think he said Tyler how are\n\n3\n00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:15,790\nyou not too bad and yourself I'm good I'm good this is Rochelle I'm with Symbio and\n\n4\n00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,632\nwe have we are going fully remote here we're a small company and we moved to a\n\n5\n00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,653\nremote desktop and I'm sure it's something simple.\n\n6\n00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,985\nI've called you guys about this before,\n\n7\n00:00:34,005 --> 00:00:34,727\nbut I don't recall how to do it,\n\n8\n00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:36,691\nbut I realized it's not,\n\n9\n00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:38,314\neven though it says it,\n\n10\n00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:41,400\nI logged out of my PCR and logged back in to authenticate RingCentral.\n\n11\n00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,219\nSo it would pull text.\n\n12\n00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,636\nAnd also I think it's pulling text.\n\n13\n00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,791\nOkay, but like my email, my Outlook, it quit pulling those.\n\n14\n00:00:49,643 --> 00:00:51,800\nAnd I think it's a quick fix, but I don't recall how to do it.\n\n15\n00:00:52,763 --> 00:00:54,809\nSo I was going to see if you could take a look because I want to make sure it's\n\n16\n00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:56,836\npulling everything from my Outlook over to PCR.\n\n17\n00:00:58,582 --> 00:00:59,576\nYeah, let me take a look.\n\n18\n00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,454\nWhat's your username for the database?\n\n19\n00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,362\nR-A-G-U-I-L-E-R-A.\n\n20\n00:01:11,841 --> 00:01:13,172\nOne more time for me.\n\n21\n00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:15,322\nR-A-G-U-I-L-E-R-A.\n\n22\n00:01:21,503 --> 00:01:21,767\nPerfect.\n\n23\n00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,167\nLet me pop in here and take a look.\n\n24\n00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,822\nand I even have,\n\n25\n00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:30,388\nI know you guys always want like an example,\n\n26\n00:01:30,408 --> 00:01:31,671\nso I have someone that I emailed early this morning,\n\n27\n00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:34,398\nand it still hadn't pulled if you needed a reference point.\n\n28\n00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,951\nNow, on this remote desktop, are you using the installed classic version of Outlook?\n\n29\n00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,802\nI don't know the answer to that,\n\n30\n00:01:49,453 --> 00:01:50,115\nbut I have been using that,\n\n31\n00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:50,416\nand I like it,\n\n32\n00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:51,017\nand I've never had an issue,\n\n33\n00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:52,240\nso is that an issue?\n\n34\n00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,300\nNo,\n\n35\n00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,321\nthat's what you need for the PCR Outlook portal if that's what you were using\n\n36\n00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,222\nbefore was the add-in that was like inside of your outlook where you can like also\n\n37\n00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,364\nlike parse the resumes and things like that maybe the add-in is not on my outlook\n\n38\n00:01:58,384 --> 00:02:01,385\nsince we switched over this has all happened in the last like couple days like it's\n\n39\n00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:04,087\nbeen a whole thing trying to get everything switched over so um but your outlook\n\n40\n00:02:04,107 --> 00:02:19,996\nlooks the same as it was before though like the classic installed version on that\n\n41\n00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:26,340\nremote desktop Yes.\n\n42\n00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,698\nI mean, it's what I've always used.\n\n43\n00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,161\nLike,\n\n44\n00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:31,715\nit's tried to do the new version over the last couple months and not always go back\n\n45\n00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,317\nto the original.\n\n46\n00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,372\nSo, yes, it should be the classic.\n\n47\n00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:35,935\nYes.\n\n48\n00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:36,289\nPerfect.\n\n49\n00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:37,861\nSo,\n\n50\n00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:38,863\nwhat I'm going to do is,\n\n51\n00:02:38,903 --> 00:02:42,348\nsince that is like an installed program,\n\n52\n00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:46,353\nif it's like a new remote desktop and you haven't installed the portal yet,\n\n53\n00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:47,154\nyou probably don't have it.\n\n54\n00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,540\nOkay.\n\n55\n00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,120\nSo, it's something that simple.\n\n56\n00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,620\nOkay.\n\n57\n00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,400\nYep.\n\n58\n00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,351\nSo what I'm going to do here is I did reinstall it last week when I was doing all\n\n59\n00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:03,180\nthis with our new IT guy.\n\n60\n00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,160\nSo I assumed it was on here, but obviously he doesn't really understand.\n\n61\n00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,593\nI think we were looking more at PCR capture maybe,\n\n62\n00:03:11,593 --> 00:03:18,079\nand we didn't look at the – to make sure the add-on was on the Outlook is what I'm\n\n63\n00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:18,420\nthinking.\n\n64\n00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,980\nThat very well could be.\n\n65\n00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:54,680\nSo what I'm going to do – Let me find it here.\n\n66\n00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:58,181\nBec",
