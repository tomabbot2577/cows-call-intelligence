    "text": "Thank you for calling MainSuite for Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Michael from United Employment. You were helping us get Portal on here? Yeah. How's it going? Not good. So, I mean, we're not computer people at all, and this is a new computer. I don't know if it's because of the Outlook version or something that's popping up or not, but I got it to the point where it did the launcher or it did the – I downloaded it, and then it went through like the different phases. You saw like the little bar go get full, and then it said finish, but there was nowhere to put the portal license in. I went into the options, into Outlook. I can't even find it. So I don't know if you can hop on here again. Yeah, so you probably opened the new Outlook and not the classic Outlook. Yeah, I don't even know how to turn that off. So whatever is not working here. It automatically goes. I can't seem to get it off the computer because it seems to open two versions of it. If you click on it, it opens up the new version. Yeah, let me do... Should I send the email to Scott's email? Yeah, well, I got that email, but I don't think the email helps. I mean, I pay for the service. Can you just jump on here? No, for a meeting link. Oh, yeah, that's fine. Yeah, that's what I said. I was sending over a meeting link to hop on again. And you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window. Share the screen. Yep. Alright. Go ahead and I'm going to ask for remote control here. Oh, I see what happened. All right, this will be a quick fix for us. Thank you. All right. It should hopefully let me... Excuse me. Oh, it's not going to let me... Oh, there it goes. Just took a second. And I can cut and paste from the email you sent us if you want. Yeah, go ahead and do that. I'll let you take back over. Nope, don't hit cancel. I can just type it in. It's fine. Why is it saying expired? One second here. I'm just going to fix that license for us. Alright. Let me... Yep, and that's going to ask me one more time now that I got that cleared out. what we like to see Thank you. Just database. All right, we'll just need Scott's username and password in those sections there. What's your password, UEG? You don't have your cap lock. 011. And that's going to ask if you want to sync the PCR. and that's the email tracking and you'll check the little box that says remember my password I must be missing it right under where it says United Employment Group up just a tad and then you'll put No, you'll put the password in the password section one more time. And then you'll check that little box that says always allow. And that opens. Yep. Now you're good to go. Alrighty. I appreciate the help. Hey, one quick question while I have you on. I know this is pushing us through to the new Outlook and everything else. Is there coming a time where you guys won't have the portal add-on? So with the new Outlook, they don't support add-ins like the way they used to, like with how we're kind of embedded into Outlook, the installed version. They're not allowing that anymore with their add-ins. so even if we were to develop something for the new outlook it's not going to be nearly the same it's not going to have nearly as much capability so things like the email tracking and parsing you would still be able to parse resumes but the email and calendar syncing isn't going to be there so it won't register the activities of the email like so email won't show up under name record not with the Outlook portal you'd have to do it just with an IMAP inside of PC Recruiter oh wow so yeah Microsoft's being really stingy with how they do their add-ins now with that new Outlook okay alright well I appreciate it yep no problem you have a great day Thanks.",

help you?\n\n4\n00:00:05,122 --> 00:00:05,372\nHey, Tyler.\n\n5\n00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:07,360\nThis is Michael from United Employment.\n\n6\n00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,914\nYou were helping us get Portal on here?\n\n7\n00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,036\nYeah.\n\n8\n00:00:10,161 --> 00:00:10,653\nHow's it going?\n\n9\n00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:11,720\nNot good.\n\n10\n00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,871\nSo, I mean, we're not computer people at all, and this is a new computer.\n\n11\n00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,426\nI don't know if it's because of the Outlook version or something that's popping up\n\n12\n00:00:21,526 --> 00:00:21,767\nor not,\n\n13\n00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:25,973\nbut I got it to the point where it did the launcher or it did the – I downloaded\n\n14\n00:00:26,173 --> 00:00:28,136\nit, and then it went through like the different phases.\n\n15\n00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,151\nYou saw like the little bar go get full,\n\n16\n00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,354\nand then it said finish,\n\n17\n00:00:36,374 --> 00:00:37,978\nbut there was nowhere to put the portal license in.\n\n18\n00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:41,035\nI went into the options, into Outlook.\n\n19\n00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,189\nI can't even find it.\n\n20\n00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,771\nSo I don't know if you can hop on here again.\n\n21\n00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,367\nYeah, so you probably opened the new Outlook and not the classic Outlook.\n\n22\n00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,232\nYeah, I don't even know how to turn that off.\n\n23\n00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,485\nSo whatever is not working here.\n\n24\n00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,570\nIt automatically goes.\n\n25\n00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:00,378\nI can't seem to get it off the computer because it seems to open two versions of it.\n\n26\n00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,160\nIf you click on it, it opens up the new version.\n\n27\n00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,853\nYeah, let me do...\n\n28\n00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,560\nShould I send the email to Scott's email?\n\n29\n00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,991\nYeah, well, I got that email, but I don't think the email helps.\n\n30\n00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,100\nI mean, I pay for the service.\n\n31\n00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,199\nCan you just jump on here?\n\n32\n00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,840\nNo, for a meeting link.\n\n33\n00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,648\nOh, yeah, that's fine.\n\n34\n00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:20,540\nYeah, that's what I said.\n\n35\n00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,060\nI was sending over a meeting link to hop on again.\n\n36\n00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,024\nAnd you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window.\n\n37\n00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:21,380\nShare the screen.\n\n38\n00:02:38,813 --> 00:02:39,121\nYep.\n\n39\n00:02:56,554 -->
