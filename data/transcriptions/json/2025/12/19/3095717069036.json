    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Sonya Quinn. I am with Priority Search. I've sent a couple text messages, or not text messages, sorry, emails to Patsy Lombardo. Okay. She's no longer with us. What can I help you with? Okay. Well, that explains a lot. So we have a monthly, like we have a credit card on file that we use for our monthly payment. Okay. And the owner of the company lost his wallet, so we needed to replace the credit card information, and I had sent that email to Patty Patsy, and I never received a response. Oh, okay. And then we received a decline on the 10th, and I sent another email to her, not knowing she wasn't with you guys. And so just this morning, I'm like, they still have not responded, and that's odd. So we're just trying to update credit card information. I can do that for you. Okay, so the card, because we've got the new billing portal. Let's see. The card that we have ends in 8312. So we want to take that one off, right? Okay, hold on one second. That's right. And are you going to update that with me now? Yeah, I can do it for you. Okay. Or you could do it in our new billing portal, which has to be done by C-Pro. No, it's okay. I'll help you do it. I just need to get it up. Okay. All right, bear with me. let me turn the auto pay off for a moment. You have to turn it off before you can delete the card. I will delete this card then. Okay. What is the new card? What is the name on the card? It's going to be the same name. William Crooks. Okay. William. And how do you spell his name? C-R-O-O-K-S. Perfect. Okay. Got it. And the card number? It's 4-4-0-0-6-6-6-5-4-1-3-4-0-2-5-2-8. it expires 08 of 28. Okay. And the security number? 290. Okay. Let me read off this number just to make sure. 4400-6654 13402528. You got it. Okay. Is that the address associated with the card? Is it still 1101 North Lake Destiny Road Suite 265? No. Oh, okay. What is that? It's 570 Lake Bingham Road. And how do you spell Bingham? B-I-N-G-H-A-M? Yep. 570 Lake Bingham Road and that's in Lake Mary. Okay. Lake M-A-R-Y? Yeah, two words, Lake Mary, Florida. Okay. And what is the zip code associated with the card? 32746. Now, should this address be used for your billing and everything as well? Yes, that should have been updated a long time ago. Okay. Let me just grab this. okay we're going to add this card okay you want it turned on for auto pay right yeah and then what do you show the monthly amount uh let's see let me tell you here one second uh 110 It looks like your invoice, priority search consultants, your invoice is... Okay, that's right. Two users for two users? Yep, for Bill and I. That's right. That's what we're getting. I just was looking at our receipt that we get every month, just making sure. Okay. I set this on auto pay, so it's like one of those things I don't really look at anymore because, you know, it's set up. All right. So I'm trying to reprocess it. It does take a moment for me to tell me if it actually goes through and syncs back. Yeah, that's fine. And so while we're waiting for that, if I have any future billing questions, you will be the contact person? Yes. And you can also call extension 6000. Those get directed over to me as well. Okay. Or just email billing at main sequence. Basically they at least start with me. It doesn't always end in with me, but at least starts with me. Okay. Let's see. Sorry, it could take several minutes. Look at the gentleman. It's forsaken me. So I'm really not trying to think yet this early. Jim. Is Jim his name? Gentleman in IT. Jim Wise. Oh, he was in sales. He's no longer with us, though. He's not with you guys either. Yeah. They made some changes around. I guess so. We have Jim Lombardo who handles the accounts, though. Okay, so it looks like that went through. An email should have been sent to the email associated with the account, which is cbrooks at PrioritySearch.com. Yep. Yeah, so that would send you the receipt. Yep, that's exactly right. Okay, thank you so much. You are all set. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye.",
