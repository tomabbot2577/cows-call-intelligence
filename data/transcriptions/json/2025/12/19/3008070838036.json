    "text": "David Riss Hi, David. How are you? David Riss Good. How are you? David Riss I'm pretty well. I'm pretty well. I wanted to kind of reach out. I jumped with you and I think also Deborah Page. So I wanted to kind of start with the two of you to talk a little bit about your database and see what was going on with everything. See if there was maybe some consideration, further consideration about moving to the cloud version of PC Recruiter. I just kind of wanted to follow up. Yeah, I think that we're having kind of a flat few months here. And the guy that is – Debra is the best one to talk to officially, but she's not going to make the decision. So this is an off-the-record conversation. Debra probably has the ear of Bill McCormick, who is one of the co-founders of the group, right? And Bill is the one who's going to make the final decision. Okay. Debra is probably your best contact to get something in front of Bill. But I just, I think it's going to be, yeah, it's not going to be, it's not going to be a near-term opportunity for you. For sure, for sure. Yeah, I was just trying to help out because there were some issues with the database growing, and I think there was a tech support person that had kind of gotten it figured out, but I don't know if he even knew there was a cloud option, and my tech support team kind of told him, like, we don't really support the self-hosted as heavily as you're asking. Maybe you'll want to consider cloud, and he didn't know there was a cloud. So I was just kind of reaching out to open up a dialogue. See if it was kind of, as Deborah said the last time we spoke, that probably sometime, just not then. So I just kind of want to do it again. Yeah, so that's my advice. It's just not a really, we're having a bit of a flat year. And so that's, you know, it's all on money coming in as opposed to money going out right now. Okay, okay. Cool, cool. So I'm also going to pop her an email. Should I see, I had you CC'd if I was writing it. Should I still CC you or should I leave you off? That would be fine. That would be fine. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'll just kind of reach out to open up a dialogue with her and see what's going on. Okay. All right. Well, good luck with that. I never did get the – we never did get the email working, which is a head scratcher for me. Yeah, you turned it over to Robin, I think. Yeah. I'll check on that, too. because there shouldn't be an issue, but I'll check on that and see what was going on. I think I need to run something because part of the problem is we turned over our desktop IP support to a third party, and they don't want to think outside the box. Sure. Well, thank you for the call. Very good. All right. All good. Thanks, Jim. Be well. Bye. Take care. Bye-bye.",

--> 00:00:09,935\nHow are you?\n\n5\n00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,260\nDavid Riss I'm pretty well.\n\n6\n00:00:11,342 --> 00:00:11,813\nI'm pretty well.\n\n7\n00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,928\nI wanted to kind of reach out.\n\n8\n00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:16,017\nI jumped with you and I think also Deborah Page.\n\n9\n00:00:16,841 --> 00:00:21,132\nSo I wanted to kind of start with the two of you to talk a little bit about your\n\n10\n00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:24,159\ndatabase and see what was going on with everything.\n\n11\n00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,226\nSee if there was maybe some consideration,\n\n12\n00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,337\nfurther consideration about moving to the cloud version of PC Recruiter.\n\n13\n00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:32,059\nI just kind of wanted to follow up.\n\n14\n00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,967\nYeah, I think that we're having kind of a flat few months here.\n\n15\n00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:48,146\nAnd the guy that is – Debra is the best one to talk to officially,\n\n16\n00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:49,609\nbut she's not going to make the decision.\n\n17\n00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,913\nSo this is an off-the-record conversation.\n\n18\n00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,565\nDebra probably has the ear of Bill McCormick,\n\n19\n00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:04,549\nwho is one of the co-founders of the group,\n\n20\n00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:04,710\nright?\n\n21\n00:01:10,722 --> 00:01:12,694\nAnd Bill is the one who's going to make the final decision.\n\n22\n00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,197\nOkay.\n\n23\n00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,687\nDebra is probably your best contact to get something in front of Bill.\n\n24\n00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,845\nBut I just,\n\n25\n00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,228\nI think it's going to be,\n\n26\n00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:29,429\nyeah,\n\n27\n00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,211\nit's not going to be,\n\n28\n00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:33,038\nit's not going to be a near-term opportunity for you.\n\n29\n00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,200\nFor sure, for sure.\n\n30\n00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:35,397\nYeah,\n\n31\n00:01:35,422 --> 00:01:38,249\nI was just trying to help out because there were some issues with the database\n\n32\n00:01:38,273 --> 00:01:41,587\ngrowing, and I think there was a tech support person that had kind of gotten it\n\n33\n00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:41,904\nfigured out,\n\n34\n00:01:41,928 --> 00:01:45,583\nbut I don't know if he even knew there was a cloud option,\n\n35\n00:01:45,608 --> 00:01:46,972\nand my tech support team kind of told him,\n\n36\n00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:47,094\nlike,\n\n37\n00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,482\nwe don't really support the self-hosted as heavily as you're asking.\n\n38\n00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,060\nMaybe you'll want to consider cloud, and he didn't know there was a cloud.\n\n39\n00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,820\nSo I was just kind of reaching out to open up a dialogue.\n\n40\n00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,622\nSee if it was kind of,\n\n41\n00:01:57,622 --> 00:01:59,598\nas Deborah said the last time we spoke,\n\n42\n00:01:59,598 --> 00:02:00,339\nthat probably sometime,\n\n43\n00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:01,080\njust not then.\n\n44\n00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,220\nSo I just kind of want to do it again.\n\n45\n00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,980\nYeah, so that's my advice.\n\n46\n00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,480\nIt's just not a really, we're having a bit of a flat year.\n\n47\n00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,605\nAnd so that's,\n\n48\n00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:12,302\nyou know,\n\n49\n00:02:12,302 --> 00:02:17,180\nit's all on money coming in as opposed to money going out right now.\n\n50\n00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,720\nOkay, okay.\n\n51\n00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,400\nCool, cool.\n\n52\n00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,760\nSo I'm also going to pop her an email.\n\n53\n00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,960\nShould I see, I had you CC'd if I was writing it.\n\n54\n00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,720\nShould I still CC you or should I leave you off?\n\n55\n00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,360\nThat would be fine.\n\n56\n00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,340\nThat would be fine.\n\n57\n00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:28,800\nOkay.\n\n58\n00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,320\nOkay.\n\n59\n00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:29,863\nYeah,\n\n60\n00:02:29,863 --> 00:02:32,440\nI'll just kind of reach out to open up a dialogue with her and see what's going on.\n\n61\n00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,660\nOkay.\n\n62\n00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,340\nAll right.\n\n63\n00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,660\nWell, good luck with that.\n\n64\n00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,470\nI never did get the – we never did get the email working,\n\n65\n00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,200\nwhich is a head scratcher for me.\n\n66\n00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,640\nYeah, you turned it over to Robin, I think.\n\n67\n00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:49,980\nYeah.\n\n68\n00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,960\nI'll check on that, too.\n\n69\n00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,756\nbecause there shouldn't be an issue,\n\n70\n00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,720\nbut I'll check on that and see what was going on.\n\n71\n00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:11,697\nI think I need to run something because part of the problem is we turned over our\n\n72\n00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:15,995\ndesk",
