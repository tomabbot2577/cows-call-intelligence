    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's John Seeger. Oh, hey. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Pretty good. What's going on? Good. So I'm stuck right now with the – when I log into PCR, I'm stuck with the what's new that pops up, and I can't get into the actual software itself. Okay. I can't get past that. So you're able to log in, though, right? Yes. Okay. It could be, are you, like, zoomed in? Like, you're, because there should be a box at the bottom to skip the announcement. You just can't see that? No. Ew. Yeah, I'm full screen. Yeah, are you zoomed in a lot? maybe the box is possibly too tall for your resolution. What if you zoom out a little bit, like using the scroll mouse on your computer? I mean, on your... the scroll on your mouse to kind of zoom out? Yeah, I'm zooming out. I don't see it. Hold on a second. So it should... So you're already in Peace Recruiter. You just can't get rid of the pop-up? Yeah, I can't get rid of the pop-up. Okay. And you don't see don't show me this in the future and skip at the bottom? No, I don't. Okay. Because it might be your browser zoom percentage. Okay. All right. So there should be a pop-up then, right? So I just need to figure out where that is. Yeah, at the bottom of that pop-up. Do you want to do a screen share? Yeah. Okay. Do you have RingCentral or should I send it using Google Meet? Google Meet, please. Okay. All right. Let's see. Meet. I'm talking to myself. Sorry. That's okay. So how are things going? I heard about the big lawsuit issue. Yes. It's settled down now. After a bunch of attorney fees, it's settled down. Yeah. Everything's fine. All right. That's good. okay you should have it invite in your inbox okay and i'm going to turn off my audio so don't when you join like don't join with computer audio otherwise you'll get a bunch of uh background noise sometimes okay okay since we're on the phone um and then click share screen which is the rectangle with the arrow pointing up hold on and when you go to share your screen it's going to pop up a window make sure you're going over at the right where it says entire screen and then select the screen to show i don't see that says uh allow to share window share screen don't allow so share screen you want to entire screen over at the right oh I see it yep okay all right why is that blurry okay that's weird yours is actually really blurry and I don't usually see it like that okay let's go to PC Recruiter. Oh so you're not logged in yet. Okay let's try this. Okay so you're not logged in yet. Oh I'm not logged in. Okay. Yeah you're not seeing like your database name and that stuff. Can you go at the very top right where it's got the three vertical dots and go to delete browsing data I thought you were already in the database and it was like a splash screen okay uncheck browsing history download history like only leave cached images and files selected we pushed an update so it's possible you're kind of like in as it was going and then click delete data. I'm just going to clear cache and then once that's done I'll have you go back to the login page. It should open. It'll open a little slow the first time but after that it'll be faster. Okay let's go back to Peace Recruiter. See the reload option is that kind of like almost like recycling kind of icon just below where you are right now. Let me reload this page. It's right here? Yep. Right? Yeah. Let's try that. There you go. Okay. That's interesting. Okay. For some reason, that wasn't popping up before, so I thought it's usually when I, like, I had it on last night. Oh, and then here for this one, see where it says always allow? Check that box. That way, every time you log in, you're not prompted for that. And then say open PCR URL app. Okay. This is what I – and then go back over to your PCR screen again. Apparently closed. Okay. This is the screen I thought you were missing. So if you see – next time that pops up, if you say don't show me this in the future and hit skip, that will go away. Okay. All right. So you should be all good. Yeah. I'm still not sure how that happened, but okay. All right. Yeah, you were probably headed up or something as you were pushing an update. And sometimes that just kind of causes a little conflict. Yeah. Yeah, if your browser tries to remember things so that it loads quicker, and then sometimes when we update, it gets a little stuck. It doesn't know what to show. So that clearing cache sometimes sticks out. But you should be good now. All right. Thanks, Robin. Appreciate it. You are welcome. Thanks. Have a good day. Bye. You too. Bye. Thank you.",
