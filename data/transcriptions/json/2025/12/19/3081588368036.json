Do you need any assistance with PCR? Yeah, I'm having trouble getting it to inhale. However, I am on a call, and I have to listen in on it. Can I give you a call back? Yeah, just call our support line back, and we'll be able to help you out. I think we're here until about 530 today. Eastern time. Okay. And what's your name? My name's Garrett. Feel free to ask for me if you, yeah, if you want to ask for Garrett, that's totally fine. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah. I saw your email come through with some troubleshooting tips. I know that I do have the classic Outlook and it has been working for me. The PCR, I updated the most recent version, but now everything is going from, instead of inhaling from my Outlook to PCR, it's putting everything in bad, saying that it cannot read my stuff, my resumes. So I just made sure to update my Acrobat Pro, and all of the resumes can be opened. So I'm not exactly sure why it can't read them, but I'll give you a call back after I get off of this call, and we can see. Sure, yeah. We'll take a look. Okay, awesome. Thank you so much, Jared. Talk to you soon. Bye. Sounds good.",
