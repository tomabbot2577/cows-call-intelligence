    "text": "hi robin it's debbie from electronic search hello hello did you get that link i did but i tried it and it doesn't work so i have a few she took a screenshot and we took the top one and i plugged it in and it still didn't it still didn't work it lets me do that you know enter my name and my password and the database, but there's, and then when I hit go, it doesn't do anything and there's no other button. So I don't know why it's not doing it unless I need to log in as the admin to get it to work. Okay. Hold on one second. I'm just wondering. I have a phone call at 3.30 I do too I just uninstalled it again and deleted the download you don't need to should not have to do that Let's see. Okay. Well, I did. Just in case. And I restarted my computer. See if anything changed. But I haven't done anything. I'm going to send you a new meeting link. Okay. Thank you. Okay. It should be in your inbox. Not yet. Let me check the spam location again. I thought I added you to SafeSenders, but nope. It's not there. Okay. Not yet. Let me check the spam location again. I thought I added you to SafeCenters, but nope, still didn't do it. Okay. That's weird. Okay. Hmm. Okay, I don't know how to fix my microphone settings. I was trying to do it, but I have to dig deeper. So I guess we have to stay on the phone. Yeah, that was just fine. Okay. Okay, so I'm going to have you click share screen, but then make sure again you're going over to entire screen. Right. Okay, that link that you received from her or him, copy that into a browser for me. I just want to see something. Can you see it on my email? Okay, yeah, right click directly on it. Like don't drag over it because it could be that it's picking up. Okay, hit copy hyperlink. Copy hyperlink. Okay. And then also, let's just while we're here, right click on it and say open hyperlink. Okay, so we see that there. Okay, let's go over to that download file again. And if you removed it, I need to have you rerun it. Yeah, there it is. Is it doing it? . . Okay, let's open up Outlook. Should I set it in open? No, let's go File, Exit, and then go back in. Can I close this screen? Or no? It doesn't matter. Yeah, just minimize it. it. Okay. Okay, that screen it's probably hovering down at the bottom. If you hover on your Outlook icon. You mean this one? No, hover on the Outlook icon down at the very bottom but go to that first window okay yeah yeah click on that okay click add connection let's see what happens here clear all of that out paste your url and just make sure there's no space at the end okay click uh go why is there no login screen yeah hold on one second I'm going to save it. Can you open up Edge for me? Maybe try this. Go to the three vertical dots at the top right. Go to delete browsing data. There it is. Okay. Just clear this. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, for time range, change that to all time. I don't see, oh, time range. All time, okay. Uncheck browsing history, uncheck download history, and uncheck cookies. I only want you to clear cache. Okay. Clear now. Can we minimize this? I haven't figured out a good way to yet I know it's kind of annoying okay let's go back to let's go back hover on outlook down at the bottom should I close this internet oh wait hold on move that google meet over option I don't know yeah okay yeah I hit clear browsing data now or actually you know what I think we already did that we already did yeah okay go hover I thought it was like a confirmation but it wasn't hover on the outlook icon down okay let's uh let's paste that url in here actually you know what let's close that okay let's click on add connection again replace that with your URL the one that I the original one the first one yeah you probably saw it on your clipboard yeah okay still no and if to maximize it. Nothing there either, right? Yeah. What the heck is that? I thought maybe if I put my info in that it would suddenly appear, but it doesn't. And go into the drop-down. Let me just And to the drop down. Yeah. I wonder if it's just maybe the version that you're having of. Let me see something here. Thank you. I'm going to try to see if I find an alternate way to do this. I'm not sure what's going on here. Could there be some kind of new permission thing that I don't have available? No, I'm going to have you try something else. Okay. Okay. I had a piece of name that ODBC. It's a bit different, though. Let's try it. Let's have a look. Let's see. Only one thing. ODBC name. Can you take your URL and put it into the chat area down at the bottom? It's probably still there. All right. How do I do the chat again? Go to maximize your meeting window. One over. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to try something else, see if I can figure it out. If I sent this, how would that look? While you're doing this, I want to, if I can. Oh, I can't. Crap, who am I talking to? Jerry. Jerry. Oh, you don't want me to log into PCR, do you? I'm not trying to can I ask what is your username and password only because I'm trying to see if I were to break this up, how I would do that. And I'm. I mean, I think I can. Okay. And I'm just trying to see, like, because I'm going to see if I could kind of, like, generate the criteria it would need if I have you just manually type it in. But for me to make the connection, it wants to know credentials. There's my login in the chat. Okay, got it. What I'm trying to do is actually the inhaler tool kind of needs something similar. So I'm trying to see ESI database news. I used to have that too. Yeah, I'm trying to see if I kind of manually try to do it like how it breaks it up And then I could just maybe send this back to you. Debbie, OK, and then this, password. Even here, it's like. Do you have two-factor authentication turned on for your database? No, oh, okay, it did it. Hold on one second. Host name, okay. Actually, I'll move your screen over. Okay, can you do me a favor and then go back to the inhaler screen? So hover on Outlook and bring up that configuration. So close out of that one. Okay. Host name, database. Okay. Let's try. Okay. So I took a picture, a screenshot of that info from my old computer. so it worked so if you want that data like this stuff the username password server I wonder if the server needs to be the full same thing Thank you. I don't think that part makes a difference. Okay. Where it says name, let's just have you type in database name.odbcdatabaseid. Okay. ESI underscore main underscore new. Yeah. Try that. Okay. Now. Remember my password? Yeah, go ahead. Do that. Okay, that'll be that part of it. Okay. Where it says host, I'm sorry, where it says server IP URL, let's try pcr.electronicsearch.com. without the HTTPS in front of it? I'm not sure we're going to try it okay database put ESI in capital letters underscore main in capital letters underscore new with just a capital N dot TXT so new is not all capital? correct just the N Oh, that's weird. Okay. Okay, I'm trying this. I'm not sure if it's going to work. .txt. Okay. Yeah. Okay, username, and then put in the same credentials. Okay. Okay, let's hit test connection up at the top. There was no endpoint listening. There is no, wait, Cosmin incorrect address. Okay, let's try how you had it before with the HTTPS. Okay. Actually, and let's do, I guess, try HTTP. Oh, that got added in there, huh? Try that in there. Okay, in my old screen, in the one below it, new is capitalized, too, in the picture that I took of the... That part really is not case sensitive. Oh, no, it's none of it. Okay. Actually, none of it was capitalized in that. Okay. Let's try test connection now. Okay. Success. Oh, okay. So one of the S. Okay, so that's a good sign. Hit okay. Okay. Now, did you sync your calendar before? No, she told me not to. Okay, so her sync... No, just go in there, say no synchronization. And then she also said set up auto activities. Okay, so there you're going to pick your email address. Yeah, okay. Okay, hit save and close. Okay. What I'm going to have you do is click name up on the main toolbar within the PCR ribbon. I just want to see if it opens. Did you see that little flash? Nope. See, it flashes something and it doesn't stay there for very long. Let's go to File, Exit. Okay. Go back into Outlook. See, it still has the screen over here again. Oh, maybe we didn't hit. We did hit Save and Close, didn't we? Yep. Okay, let's try it again. let's try add let's see go into that go into the drop down okay doesn't have anything yeah go to add connection again we're going to try this again put your URL in there again for me HTTPS okay and hit go. Is there anything lacking there? There's nowhere to put... Yeah, see that's what I'm thinking is that there's something, maybe there's a setting on my computer because this is a new computer or on Outlook that's saying it can't do this. I've never run into this before that's why I had to go to like just the edge and see and like maybe clear cache I've never run into this okay let's try doing the manual portion again okay I can either do anything unless I exit out okay get out of there oh wait maybe it'll minimize okay okay let's try that let's try with a name again no but well let me click on it do you have any other alerts popping up anywhere no what about what was in that third window it's just my inbox yeah close out of that third one The third one. No, the third one. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So let's try this. Let's give it a name. Maybe it wants two parts of it. Normally it does. Okay. Type ESI underscore main underscore new dot electronic search. Okay. That part that you had before that started with HTTPS, put that in there. In here? Mm-hmm. I'm going to try this again. Okay. This is the ESI main underscore new dot txt. Or do you want the full thing? That one I think is just going to be that. Okay. Okay. Nope. Okay. The same. That's a, yeah. Hmm. So I just said, okay. Close this or do you want to see it? What's different than what you had before in your screenshot? It is. It is. Yeah. Oh, what's different? Yeah. So go ahead. Okay. Well, well, this is only this. Okay. Let me get the screenshot. Hold on. yeah that's only that and then this is oh yeah that part we just wanted that tcr electronic search dot com oh okay it has connection now let's see what we got okay Okay. Hit save and close. Okay. Let's go click configure up on the, I'm sorry, click options. So it's at the end of your piece of cruder ribbon. Why is it not saving though? I don't really know what's going on here. I'll be honest. I do have an internal meeting at 3.30. I will run if I think I've never seen this happen. Okay. All right. Well, you'll email me or call me and let me know. Yeah. It might be somebody else calling you, but can you send me all of that that you sent, like all of it, so I can show them like what we tried? Like your screenshot of what you did before, can you send that to me? Like what you had? Yeah, I can. It's a picture. I took a picture with my phone, but I will mail it to myself and then send it to you. Okay. And actually the link that you had generated. So between the two, I can share my screen. Yeah, the one that we generated out of the. You mean this one? Yeah. Send me that along with what you had before, because I'm going to have to kind of run it by and see what's going on. Okay. Okay. All righty. Okay. Thank you. Sorry about this. I don't know. Okay. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye.",
