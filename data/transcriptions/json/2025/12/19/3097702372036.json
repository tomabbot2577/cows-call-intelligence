Good morning, Noel. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. I got your email here the other day and wanted to give you a call about the contract there. It was a $300 setup, so that's the one time. And then at the bottom where it says kind of up above where it will start with the payment of this balance, it's actually just reiterating that's $300 a month so the increase of 25 per user puts you at 100 per user time only wait let me look at that so your actual new rate should be 75 times 4 $300 a month for the four users so that's going to be your total monthly so it would be $300 a month times four users 75 per user per month but that actually wouldn't be charged right now all that we would charge to actually get you set up a $300 set up we would adjust your monthly so that whenever the next monthly payment goes through it would just be for the full $300 less the couple of users plus the change so that is a little confusing the contract always been like that but it would actually only need to be paid $300 to get started because the extra hundred dollars per month that'll happen on the next monthly fee I'll pop you an email as well but if you have any other questions give me a call four four zero eight five six zero three one four that's four four zero eight five six zero three one four thanks",
