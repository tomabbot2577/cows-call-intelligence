    "text": "Hello. Hello. I don't know what's going on there. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I was getting sounds out of my computer, but not on the call. I did send you a Zoom thing if you want to try that. Oh, you can just go back into the link that I sent you, but then just like mute the audio. We just will use the phone. But go back into the link? Yeah, just when you join, don't join with camera or microphone. Okay. And then we'll just use it to share screen. Mine just said camera failed. You want me to turn off the microphone here, right? Yeah. Otherwise, you sometimes might get some interference, like some echoing, which is really bad. You know, when I went in, my speakers worked. I hear a jing, you know, like a computer sound. Yeah, I'm not sure. And as far as I know, it was working for me. I'm using the same headset. I don't really know what happened there. Mine was showing that, like, you know, when you talk, you see the volume thing. Yeah. I don't know. And I could hear you. I just couldn't hear you and I could see my mic go up and down when I was talking so it was picking me up and you said you could hear me but either way. How to share screen. So I'm going to have you click share screen which is the rectangle with the arrow at the bottom of the meeting screen but just make sure you go over to the right where it says entire screen. Okay. and I'm going to choose I got two screens I'm choosing this screen that's the screen we're on but it'll move us okay all right let's go over to your main PCR window and which one do you want to go into okay yeah all right so let's go to a company oops and then let's click the add position icon at the top right of the company. It's like the little briefcase, or you could do that too. Yeah, I do it in two steps. Sorry. Okay. Should it be popping up? Okay. Hit select. Oh, this is what you meant by the pop-up. Yeah. Yeah. Make sure you hit select. I don't think this popped up. Okay. Am I just going? I think you already discovered the problem. I don't know if that didn't pop up or we didn't use it. You specifically asked about that. Yeah, you have to hit select. Maybe if you hit close, it didn't apply it. Right. I wonder. Okay. So you want me to go to that position? Yeah. Oh, I'm on it. You're actually on it. Oops. Yeah, I'm on it. And then hit pipeline. I imagine it's going to function perfectly. Yes. Okay. And then you just say skip. Don't show. Okay. Okay. Now, the other thing. Let me see something. I might be able to help you out a little bit. Let me just see something here. Well, we can use all the help we can get. Give me one second. No problem. I'm running a little search query. Okay. Appreciate your patience with me. I don't know what happened. Why should I not do that? That sounds suspicious. Yeah. Why is it not letting me do that on your database? Our database is very unique to problems. Now it's user problems. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I hope that's not doing it. I don't know why it's not returning. If it doesn't mind, I run the same. I wonder what else it could be. Thank you. you One second. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. you Thank you. working there. Thank you. I was thinking of doing is if like I could probably run a script to apply the template but only if it's like the jobs available but doesn't have anybody in the pipeline. you've got like 224 open jobs and the scriptures i'm trying to run it runs fine in my database but not yours um you're trying to apply it to the existing jobs no i can't do that because you might have people in the pipeline where you know the step lines can't align but if you did if you had jobs that are open yeah they don't have anybody in the pipeline yet it should be almost every job except for a test job. Well, that wouldn't be true. When people come to our website, they're linked to a job. So you would find some where there are people linked. But recruiters aren't linking people. It's just something we're not doing. A lot of the jobs do. Yeah? Okay. Well, like you said, you're just from here forward. On check. On check. On check. Let me see. I almost have to review these. I've only got one person. I can do that one. That one I can't. That one would be fine. That one I can't. I'm going to go ahead and close your eyes. That one I can't. Do you have anybody? I'll do that when I'm good. I can't. I'm going to just figure out who would be safe to do, but I'm only going to focus on the open ones. I'll put them into a roll-up. Okay. So we at least have – let's see. That was this one. Can't do that one. That one's fine. That's one. Give me a little bit of time. I'll let you know when this is done. I'm going to figure out what jobs I can do it. I'm not supposed to do this, but it's definitely helpful. You're having fun and helping us? Yeah. That would be appreciated. I like doing fun stuff. Thank you. Kind of mix it up sometimes. Been doing this a long time. Right, right. Okay. That was fun. I think I got four. They were all online. Like, if you moved anybody past the inbox, then I can't do it. I'm only going to do it for the open ones. I can't imagine there'd be anyone in there like that unless we do a little test. Yeah, there's a couple. Yeah, like somebody moved into a resume stage. There are definitely a few. Let's have inquiry. Okay, so that page. I just kind of have to review them. It's probably rare when you get an opportunity to do this because people are already using the pipeline. Yeah, normally I just say, like, we just say we don't do it. Yeah, you can't do it. That's when I can't. Well, you know how to do a lot of stuff. When I've called, I've always sought you out, if possible. Get that ticketing system to go directly to you because I know you know the system so well. Yeah. Problem is then everything gets loaded on me. When I've been here 19 years, you've got someone who's only been here a couple of years. It's like, I can't keep up with my emails. And your manager doesn't always maybe like it either. Yeah. The customers go directly and they want to follow a process. Yeah. That's good for tracking too, you know, just like, oh, if there's a ticket, we could see everything all in one place and all that stuff. Right. Gosh, I remember the old days, how we used to do things. Sometimes I'm like, oh, my God, no wonder we were a little nutty sometimes. Yeah. Okay, those are fine. Those are fine. So you have some programming abilities, right? You're writing a script? No, I don't program, but I know how to do some SQL stuff. You're just dangerous enough. Yeah, I'm dangerous enough. But I'm not stupid, so I don't try to do things I can't do. That would not be good for you. I will say I have no clue. I mean, some things I wouldn't even have access to. Right, right. Like I can't change the code in the system, but sometimes I know how to write scripts to do things. But some things I can't, even if I know how to write the script, I can't do it because it wouldn't be indexed then. So then something like this. I'm just going to basically look at what that template ID is and apply it to these jobs that don't have anybody in the pipeline or at least not past that inbox. Very good. So I, if you want, I'll just let you know when this is done. So at least most of your jobs can get the new pipeline this way. I'm also looking at other databases separately, though. But I'll let you know when it's done. Actually, if you're in the main database, that's the only one you need to do. You don't even have to do the other one. We don't put jobs in that one. Okay. Okay, so if you're doing it in the main database, that's all. Yeah, that's the one I'm in right now. Sounds great. Yeah, terrific. All right. Well, thank you for all your help. And I did get your request. They got caught in my spam filter. That's why I couldn't do that. I'm going to resolve why I couldn't hear you, though. I don't know what was up with that. but I've been finding that going more to the spam filter lately, the meeting links. I don't know why. It's kind of weird. Do you think it's not even getting caught in there more filters anytime? There's yeah. Yeah. I had a couple of things, but yeah, sometimes when there's links, they just move it over and then the links won't work until you move it to inbox. I had somebody with that. I'm like, Oh, well, we have a totally separate system. We're about to leave it, but we have to log into the spam filter itself and get it out of there, which is kind of a pain in the ass. You have to look there constantly, right? Yeah. Anyways, thank you very much, Robin. We always appreciate your help. No problem. I should have this done in about five, ten minutes. Probably five. Okay. I just got to figure out. I got to make a roll-up of them first. I'm going to make a roll-up, then I'll just get. Actually, I'll keep the roll-ups so we can see which ones I was able to do it on. Oh, yeah, okay. Sounds good. You going to shoot me an email with the name of it or something? Yep. Yep. Sounds great. I sure will. All righty. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",

00:00:05,158\nYeah, I don't know.\n\n5\n00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:09,019\nI mean, I was getting sounds out of my computer, but not on the call.\n\n6\n00:00:09,483 --> 00:00:11,138\nI did send you a Zoom thing if you want to try that.\n\n7\n00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:11,801\nOh,\n\n8\n00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:14,950\nyou can just go back into the link that I sent you,\n\n9\n00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,277\nbut then just like mute the audio.\n\n10\n00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,431\nWe just will use the phone.\n\n11\n00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:21,931\nBut go back into the link?\n\n12\n00:00:23,341

echoing,\n\n21\n00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,993\nwhich is really bad.\n\n22\n00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,699\nYou know, when I went in, my speakers worked.\n\n23\n00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,039\nI hear a

--> 00:00:49,736\nI'm using the same headset.\n\n27\n00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,560\nI don't really know what happened there.\n\n28\n00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:55,379\nMine was showing that, like, you know, when you talk, you see the volume thing.\n\n29\n00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:55,984\nYeah.\n\n30\n00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:56,970\nI don't know.\n\n31\n00:00:57,542 --> 00:00:58,095\nAnd I could hear you.\n\n32\n00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,633\nI just couldn't hear you and I could see my mic go up and down when I was talking\n\n33\n00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:08,060\nso it was picking me up and you said you could hear me but either way.\n\n34\n00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:09,579\nHow to share screen.\n\n35\n00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,207\nSo I'm going to have you click share screen which is the rectangle with the arrow\n\n36\n00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:17,433\nat the bottom of the meeting screen but just make sure you go over to the right\n\n37\n00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:21,160\nwhere it says entire screen.\n\n38\n00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,244\nOkay.\n\n39\n00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,922\nand I'm going to choose I got two screens I'm choosing this screen that's the\n\n40\n00:01:25,942 -->
