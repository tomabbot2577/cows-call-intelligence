    "text": "Thank you for calling MainSignature Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yeah, I spoke to Tyler earlier. I've got an issue where our security feature in our Microsoft 365 puts an external little flag on resumes sent from anything outside of our system. Oh, okay. Okay. And it triggers an error with the inhaler application? I see. Okay. Let me see if Tyler is available. One second. Tyler. Okay. Let me check. One second. Okay. Yeah. It went to his voicemail. He might be, yeah, he might be on lunch actually right now. Do you want me to send you maybe to his voicemail and then you can just leave a message. He'll get back to you. Well, he came online. He wasn't able to figure out the issue. He thought the issue was that we had these external tags, but it's just a standard Microsoft security feature. So inhaler should be able to work with this external tag. So it looks like maybe some sort of change was made to the inhaler app recently, and it's breaking it with this Microsoft security feature. So I need whoever handles inhaler as a developer probably needs to have a trouble ticket set up. Okay. I see what you mean. So it's, you're using, it's called a PCR outlook portal, right? The, the add in for outlook classic. No. Okay. So it's the inhaler. The inhaler application. Oh, okay. Resume inhaler. Here, I'll create a ticket then. So, new ticket, Eric. And we'll say it's the resume inhaler. It's not working with Microsoft security tags. Yeah, where it says an email came from an external source, there is a little flag that pops up that says... I could do a screenshot and send you a couple of things just to show you. Okay, yeah. Let me give you my direct email address and I can build that ticket and we can send it up to the developers. Let me know when you're ready for the email. Let me do the screenshot. Okay. Go ahead. You can send that to G as in Garrett, G-K-O-M as in Michael, Y-A-T-I, Garrett, or it's gcomiotti at main sequence dot net. Thank you. All right, and then I'll do the snippet of what the inhaler error is. Oh, perfect. All right, that would be great. You know what? Is it working now? Maybe somebody already fixed it. Okay. That would be great. Is it specific folders or just one specific folder that's having the issue, email folder? So, again, maybe whoever, maybe I wasn't the only person to report it and they've already fixed the ticket. Oh, interesting. Okay. I'm just saying because it doesn't seem to, let's see if it stops on these other ones. Maybe it was just a bad batch of resumes from Monster because they came in a slight delay. Oh, okay. I'll let you know because it's almost – because I sent myself some new ones today, even though they're showing external. Okay. Because I'm troubleshooting it. Let's see. It's almost there. Yep. So, it's saying unhandled exception. All right. So it is saying that this is, it's weird. Actually, let me have it out. So it still just could be specific to this batch. I don't really. Okay. Interesting. Yeah, that makes sense. I wonder if it has to do something with Monster. Maybe I could do some tests to see Monster resumes specifically on my machine. Okay. Yeah. I guess if it happens again, yeah, definitely reach out, and we'll continue to troubleshoot. I'm glad it started working for you now, but definitely keep an eye on it if something pops up. Certain resumes are breaking it for whatever reason, and it's just from this one batch. I'm still going to send this to you, but it's just this one batch, and these ones were delayed somehow, so I don't know if something got corrupted while it was emailed. Ah, okay. The only times we see, or one of the main times we see problems with the resume inhaler is if somebody's trying to bring in a resume that doesn't actually have text. It's like an image or a photo of text. Yeah, it's in a bad folder. Right, okay. Okay, just got your email. All right, So I missed security tags. And monster. Okay. Yeah, okay. I'll take a look at that. Now it's working. It's weird. Yeah, you did mention maybe it's some kind of delay. Yeah. with those emails? That could be. And I know Resume is doing some, Monster is doing some merging with Career Builder, and they've also had delays where their resumes aren't reaching us, our email. So I don't know if the problem, but still the problem is triggered from your app is what I'm saying. Because your app is saying, hey, this is an external, and the external is triggering an error. And I can send you the detail, too. Oh, yeah, I see that with the detail button. Sure, yeah, why don't you throw that in there? It can help. All right. Yeah, let me do that exception and expand. I'll reply to that email I just sent you so you have the additional. So weird. I've never had this before, and Tyler hadn't seen it before either. Yeah, definitely new to me. But it's good we're gathering these screenshots here. That'll be definitely helpful. Here's the exception. I copied all the detail. Let me get into your scent. So it's going to be on that same thread. I'm just going to reply to what I sent you. That's cool. That'll work. Yeah. cool all right so that should be enough detail so i do think there's something like inhalers should still work i think unless these and i can send you should i send you one of the ones that it won't inhale like boards a couple of them to you as an attachment so you can like troubleshoot it like yeah maybe just give me one of those or two one or two yeah perfect just something like that And I'll do it on my own machine with my own setup there and try to recreate the issue, see if we can pinpoint what's going on. All right, I sent you like five of them, so you can have a test pool. All right, I just sent you five. Never seen that before. I've been a user for 25 years. Yeah, that does seem strange. That is a new one for me, too. Yeah, awesome. I'll take a look at this and see if I can pick out what's going on with that and maybe pass it over to some of the developers, see if they have any ideas as well. So, yeah, I'm a super user, so I usually can troubleshoot 95% of this stuff. Awesome. All right. Well, if you can get any answers for me, that would be helpful. I just told my IT guy to hold off on anything for now. I was going to have him pull these external tags, but it seems like it works on some, but this batch for whatever, it's triggering this error. So who knows? Gotcha. Maybe it's a key word in the title. I don't know. Okay. Okay, could be, yeah, let me, I'm just gonna make a quick note about that so I know to look at that here. Title, huh, okay. Yeah, we will take a look and yeah, just let us know if anything else comes up related to that or if you have any other questions, just let us know. Okay, sounds good, thanks. Thanks.",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,420\nYeah, I spoke to Tyler earlier.\n\n5\n00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,026\nI've got an issue where our security feature in our Microsoft 365 puts an external\n\n6\n00:00:14,106 --> 00:00:18,252\nlittle flag on resumes sent from anything outside of our system.\n\n7\n00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:25,508\nOh, okay.\n\n8\n00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:25,969\nOkay.\n\n9\n00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,749\nAnd it triggers an error with the inhaler application?\n\n10\n00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,102\nI see.\n\n11\n00:00:33,321 --> 00:00:33,570\nOkay.\n\n12\n00:00:34,263 --> 00:00:35,149\nLet me see if Tyler is available.\n\n13\n00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,568\nOne second.\n\n14\n00:00:38,902 --> 00:00:39,044\nTyler.\n\n15\n00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:40,943\nOkay.\n\n16\n00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:42,880\nLet me check.\n\n17\n00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:43,252\nOne second.\n\n18\n00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:43,743\nOkay.\n\n19\n00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,429\nYeah.\n\n20\n00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:46,837\nIt went to his voicemail.\n\n21\n00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,295\nHe might be, yeah, he might be on lunch actually right now.\n\n22\n00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:54,457\nDo you want me to send you maybe to his voicemail and then you can just leave a\n\n23\n00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:54,698\nmessage.\n\n24\n00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:55,960\nHe'll get back to you.\n\n25\n00:00:58,006 --> 00:00:59,179\nWell, he came online.\n\n26\n00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,940\nHe wasn't able to figure out the issue.\n\n27\n00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,089\nHe thought the issue was that we had these external tags,\n\n28\n00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,640\nbut it's just a standard Microsoft security feature.\n\n29\n00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,731\nSo inhaler should be able to work with this external tag.\n\n30\n00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,127\nSo it looks like maybe some sort of change was made to the inhaler app recently,\n\n31\n00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,992\nand it's breaking it with this Microsoft security feature.\n\n32\n00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,119\nSo I need whoever handles inhaler as a developer probably needs to have a trouble\n\n33\n00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:29,540\nticket set up.\n\n34\n00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:31,080\nOkay.\n\n35\n00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,472\nI see what you mean.\n\n36\n00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,828\nSo it's, you're using, it's called a PCR outlook portal, right?\n\n37\n00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,040\nThe, the add in for outlook classic.\n\n38\n00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:39,921\nNo.\n\n39\n00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:41,923\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,699\nSo it's the inhaler.\n\n41\n00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,299\nThe inhaler application.\n\n42\n00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:47,060\nOh, okay.\n\n43\n00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,179\nResume inhaler.\n\n44\n00:01:51,066 --> 00:01:52,339\nHere, I'll create a ticket then.\n\n45\n00:01:53,884 --> 00:01:59,040\nSo, new ticket, Eric.\n\n46\n00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,612\nAnd we'll say it's the resume inhaler.\n\n47\n00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:11,400\nIt's not working with Microsoft security tags.\n\n48\n00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:11,920\nYeah,\n\n49\n00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:14,767\nwhere it says an email came from an external source,\n\n50\n00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,071\nthere is a little flag that pops up that says...\n\n51\n00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,899\nI could do a screenshot and send you a couple of things just to show you.\n\n52\n00:02:26,061 --> 00:02:26,367\nOkay, yeah.\n\n53\n00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,416\nLet me give you my direct email address and I can build that ticket and we can send\n\n54\n00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:34,299\nit up to the developers.\n\n55\n00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,139\nLet me know when you're ready for the email.\n\n56\n00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:41,077\nLet me do the screenshot.\n\n57\n00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:50,682\nOkay.\n\n58\n00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,026\nGo ahead.\n\n59\n00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,071\nYou can send that to G as in Garrett,\n\n60\n00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:03,873\nG-K-O-M as in Michael,\n\n61\n00:03:04,674 --> 00:03:05,014\nY-A-T-I,\n\n62\n00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:05,695\nGarrett,\n\n63\n00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:08,479\nor it's gcomiotti at main sequence dot net.\n\n64\n00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:14,945\nThank you.\n\n65\n00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,809\nAll right, and then I'll do the snippet of what the inhaler error is.\n\n66\n00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,335\nOh, perfect.\n\n67\n00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,900\nAll right, that would be great.\n\n68\n00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,029\nYou know what?\n\n69\n00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,525\nIs it working now?\n\n70\n00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,507\nMaybe somebody already fixed it.\n\n71\n00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:19,482\nOkay.\n\n72\n00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:20,642\nThat would be great.\n\n73\n00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:31,979\nIs it specific folders or just one specific folder that's having the issue,\n\n74\n00:04:31,999 --> 00:04:32,240\nemail folder?\n\n75\n00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:37,460\nSo,\n\n76\n00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,543\nagain,\n\n77\n00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:39,325\nmaybe whoever,\n\n78\n00:04:39,365 --> 00:04:43,434\nmaybe I wasn't the only person to report it
