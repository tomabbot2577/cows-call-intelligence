    "text": "Thank you for calling me, Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Ed Purge is calling from CWP. I'm having a problem fixing the LinkedIn connection from my PCR records. So if I'm on a candidate and I hit his LinkedIn link and you hit it and it says this page does not exist. OK, so I find the guy on LinkedIn and I try to copy and paste his new address into, you know, click on the three dots down there and update the address for LinkedIn. I do that. I save it and it's still it doesn't take it. Just it it comes back and says so. So is it possible to share screen so I can show you what I'm talking about? Sure, yeah, I do have your database pulled up right now. Which name record are you having an issue with? I could test it on my end as well. Yeah, a bunch of them. Austin Mac is one that I figured you'd ask, so I wanted to have one down. Austin Mac is the fellow that I was having some difficulty with. Okay, so there's an Austin Mac. Oh, go ahead. Transportation engineer. Got it. Oh, so there's two Austin Max transportation engineer. One's at a place called WSP. One's at a place called WSP Columbus, Ohio. Yeah, that's the same guy. Yeah. OK, you have two records. Do you know which which one you're having the issue with? The one I'm at on that one at WSP Columbus, Ohio. OK, cool. Test that one out. Okay, yeah, so when I click on the LinkedIn there, I am getting that same issue where it says the page does not exist. Let me, and then you say you search for Austin Mac. It's Austin Mack, EI. You can see him right up there. Transportation engineer at WSP. Got it. Okay. You got the building and his picture in a building in a big red swoop there to the right of it. Yep. I'm seeing that. Then we've got, yeah, I'm looking at that web address up at the top, double checking. It does look like it is matching the one that you have. Okay. Let me do this. I'm going to add that web address to my own database here and see if that, see LinkedIn, see if that has the same issue. That works as well. Okay. Austin Mac, EIT, 4250A6. Also, I noticed that when I try to remove an L-set, and I have put that in there, so that may, I've tried this five times with Austin Mac. So when I hit the remove button, when I click on his LinkedIn, I'm sorry, on the three buttons down there, and they go up to his LinkedIn and they have the trash can there that says remove. When I hit that, nothing happens. I would think that whatever site was in there, whatever address was in there, it would disappear. But I click the remove and nothing happens. Oh, okay. So I have to hit the edit button and then back it up and this and then put the new one in, whatever. So something's funky here. Right. Okay. Yeah. And let me test that. In my database, the trash can is not working either. So that is, I'm seeing that as well. Okay. Let me hit save. And go here. Edit. And backspace. Let's save. Save. Okay, yeah, and that's not getting rid of it either. So if I do the edit and I clear it out and hit save and I kind of come back to the profile, it's still having that same thing. It looks like you can't. You have to refresh it. And so in the old days, a few months ago, that's how it used to work, because when you'd update their LinkedIn whatever address, and then you'd hit edit name and save it, then you'd hit edit name and kind of refresh everything. And then when you hit the LinkedIn tab, it would go right to the new one. So it's worked flawlessly for many years, but something's going on here. And it wasn't just with Austin Mac. It was with a whole bunch of people. I've tried this over the last couple of weeks. I've noticed, man, I've got to get that fixed. That was just the latest one over the weekend. I'm like, you know what? I need to call in, and I know I need to have an example to go to. Yeah. And whatever. That's good. Yeah. So there might be a few bugs going on here. First off, the delete trash can is not working. Let me make a note here. trash can not working that is backspace so yeah when we do edit backspace and save on that it's still after refreshing doesn't save the changes okay All right, let's try this. If you – Is there something? No, I think it has to do with that social bar on the left that was updated recently. I think there's something wrong with it, so I'll put in a support ticket. But in the meantime, can you add the LinkedIn field onto your record layout so it's also visible as one of those fields? I think that'll allow you to clear something out and save the changes. So I go into configure and I want to add the LinkedIn field someplace so I can put it wherever I want. So let's put it at the bottom of down here. Where does it make sense? general info. Okay. So there is a LinkedIn, a custom LinkedIn or what's it called? It's going to be called social underscore LinkedIn. And it'll show up as a custom. Custom social underscore LinkedIn. Okay. Got it. So I'll just do that right down there. Then if I hit, how do I save? There's a save button right there. All right. Excellent. So it should be there. So if I refresh Austin, there it is. Right. So, yeah, now I feel like if you were to remove the LinkedIn website from that, you would be able to see or you would be able to save that change. Let's see if that works. All right. Let's try it. OK. Save. him mine is always same paste okay so let me copy go back here Okay, now, okay, so it's saved in there. I don't know if you're seeing my screen, but I saved it in there. So to get to LinkedIn, do I hit that LinkedIn button or do I, oh, here, or LinkedIn profile. So I just hit that right next to it. Yeah, either the button to the right of the field or the one on the left will work. But yeah, I think the root of the problem was editing it inside the social LinkedIn, you know, the three buttons area on the left. There might be some bug in there. And it's also been a support or a ticket to the production issue team. And I'll have them investigate that where you can't really make any adjustments or even delete that when you think the three dots on the left. So I will let you know when that's fixed. But I guess, yeah, the workaround for now is just kind of use that LinkedIn field. to overwrite or get the correct websites in there. Gotcha. Okay. That's perfect. Okay. I appreciate it very much. Thank you for the help. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. All right. Bye.",
