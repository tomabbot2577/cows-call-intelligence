    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Gary Boza. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Thank you. Hey, listen, I can't seem to be able to open or add notes in PCR. It goes to the note field, but the plus sign doesn't come up, and I can't get in. I could see old... So over at the left, there's a little box for adding a note. There's a plus sign. Or let me see. How is it looking? Hold on one second. Give me one second. So did you go to the name record and then go to the notes tab, or do you have it on your front screen? Yeah. You went to the tab? I'm on a gal by the name of Jamie Miller. Okay. So if you go to the notes tab, it'll show your existing notes. And at the top left, there's a plus sign. And then just to the right of that, a search box. It's not showing me my notes. It's just underlined. I click on it and nothing happens. I'm not sure. So there should be like a plus sign. Do you have it on your front screen? Let's see here. Or are you in the notes tab? Okay, I'm on my front screen. Okay, do you have notes in there or did you go to the notes tab? Yeah, it's either way. I mean, if I'm at my front screen, I press on notes, it clicks. It underlines the word notes, but that's it. No plus sign, no showing of all notes, nothing. I mean, I'm familiar with the plus sign. I use it all the time. There's no plus sign. I can share my screen if you want to see it. I've been having this problem for a few days now. I wonder if your security has changed. Let's see. MR Chicago Northwest. What database are you in? There's MR Chicago Northwest, default database, and resume inhaler. Which database are you in? The MR Chicago. Okay. And what username are you in as? GLB. Okay. Thank you. I'm seeing it on mine for you. Should I send the screen share link to Gary B. at WorldBridgePartners.com or what email address did I send it to? Yeah, that's it. Okay. Okay, she's getting an email from me in just a moment with a link to join. When you join, don't join the computer audio or camera because we're already on the phone. Thank you. Still waiting. Still waiting. How you been? Pretty good. Not bad at all. Town must be happy the Browns won. oh yeah like that was like a big surprise right we were doing our tomatoes with like yeah we've been uh we were doing our tomatoes yesterday so we had like the nephews and not like everybody and they're like what yeah it was crazy i mean i just turned it on in the fourth quarter they were down 10 to nothing i said here we go again i said but you know 10 points isn't a lot of points. And then all of a sudden, it just totally flipped over to Cleveland. And they just kicked ass. I mean, they scored three times in the last three and a half minutes of the game. I know. I guess it makes up that kicker missing the first game, wasn't it? Yeah. Doesn't he miss like a field goal and a point after? Extra point, yeah. And we only lost like two points, I think. Maybe even one point, I can't remember now, but I think we lost by one point. So any of those two kicks would have either tied or won the game. But then he kicks a 55-yard field goal. This week. We'll see what happens in other weeks. Yeah, I know. Why am I not getting your email? I don't know. Hit send receive. See if it comes in. Send it again. Gary B. at Royal Bridge Partners. Will it be coming under your name? Yeah. Here it is, junk. Hold on. Okay. Join call? Yes. Click that link. But when I ask you about joining the audio, just don't do that. Otherwise, you could allow that, like, interference. And it echoes and stuff. It just says join now. Okay. So, click that, right? Go ahead and click that. Yeah. Okay. So, that's the link. And then, you can see that it's not going to be a link. So, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. And then, you can click that link. Okay. So what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom, yeah, it's echoing. Can you disconnect from the audio? Like on the share screen option? Are you in the meeting audio? I just turned off my audio. Okay, perfect. Otherwise it gives a lot of interference. Okay, over at the right there's a, but halfway over, in that meeting toolbar there's a share screen option. It's the one with a rectangle with the arrow in the middle of it. Click on that, but then go to the right where it says entire screen and then select what screen to show. Okay, I've got an entire screen. But then instead of saying share, it says on the bottom share and cancel and share is blended out so I can't hit shared. Why not? Hold on, let me check this. Hold on. Here we go. it does. Okay, all right so let's go over to your PCR database which is looks like a second tab up at the top left. Okay and I think it's not, click on edit name, looks like it's not displaying at all. Okay. Can you scroll down on that name record? Just go over to your main screen or your PCR screen again. That one I guess you can just kind of push off. Okay, let's go to your notes area. Let's go to edit name. Why is there a display in there? That's so strange. And then scroll down for me. Can you expand that notes area? That is really weird. Yeah, that's not what mine's looking like. Okay, so let's try this. Why do you need a Chrome update? We might run into some issues because we're in like a Google Meet. See where it's asking you to update Chrome at the top right? Over to the right more. Here? Yeah. Click on that. And then go to, go to help. Oh, you're in edge actually. Okay. Or actually, tabs will be restarted. Click restart to update. I guess that first one. Okay. Hit leave. Now this also kicked you out of the meeting, so I'll have to have you rejoin the meeting when you're back in. Let's see if this has anything to do with it. It's got to be something with your browser because mine is not doing that at all. I see yours just fine. Now what? Did it reset your browser? If you can go back to the meeting and rejoin it. Okay. And then make sure you mute the microphone. And then go back over to share screen. And make sure you select the entire screen. Okay. Let's go back over to PCR. back over to PCR. Up at the top left. You go ahead and log in. There you go. Yeah, I don't know. That was an odd one. It has something to do with your browser wanting to update. Okay. That's what I needed. You can see that little, this button wasn't around and none of these were around. Yeah, that was really strange. I never noticed a browser to do that before, but that's apparently what it was. Should we all set? Yeah, we're good. All righty. Well, have a good week. All right, you too, Robin. Nice talking to you. You too. Bye.",

Robin.\n\n4\n00:00:05,563 --> 00:00:05,995\nGary Boza.\n\n5\n00:00:06,488 --> 00:00:06,899\nHow are you?\n\n6\n00:00:07,445 --> 00:00:07,696\nI'm good.\n\n7\n00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,254\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:09,396\nGood.\n\n9\n00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:09,773\nThank you.\n\n10\n00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,631\nHey, listen, I can't seem to be able to open or add notes in PCR.\n\n11\n00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,440\nIt goes to the note field, but the plus sign doesn't come up, and I can't get in.\n\n12\n00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:23,879\nI could see old...\n\n13\n00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:28,072\nSo over at the left, there's a little box for adding a note.\n\n14\n00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,136\nThere's a plus sign.\n\n15\n00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:32,131\nOr let me see.\n\n16\n00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:33,400\nHow is it looking?\n\n17\n00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,273\nHold on one second.\n\n18\n00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:37,585\nGive me one second.\n\n19\n00:00:47,122 --> 00:00:50,490\nSo did you go to the name record and then go to the notes tab,\n\n20\n00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,653\nor do you have it on your front screen?\n\n21\n00:00:57,146 --> 00:00:57,342\nYeah.\n\n22\n00:00:54,902 --> 00:00:55,812\nYou went to the tab?\n\n23\n00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,173\nI'm on a gal by the name of Jamie

the top left, there's a plus sign.\n\n27\n00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,460\nAnd then just to the right of that, a search box.\n\n28\n00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:15,240\nIt's not showing me my notes.\n\n29\n00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:17,445\nIt's just underlined.\n\n30\n00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:20,252\nI click on it and nothing happens.\n\n31\n00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,525\nI'm not sure.\n\n32\n00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,047\nSo there should be like a plus sign.\n\n33\n00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,788\nDo you have it on your front screen?\n\n34\n00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,265\nLet's see here.\n\n35\n00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,746\nOr are you in the notes tab?\n\n36\n00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,707\nOkay, I'm on my front screen.\n\n37\n00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,420\nOkay, do you have notes in there or did you go to the notes tab?\n\n38\n00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,206\nYeah, it's either way.\n\n39\n00:01:45,241 --> 00:01:48,453\nI mean, if I'm at my front screen, I press on notes, it clicks.\n\n40\n00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,587\nIt underlines the word notes, but that's it.\n\n41\n00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,979\nNo plus sign, no showing of all notes, nothing.\n\n42\n00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:00,276\nI mean, I'm familiar with the plus sign.\n\n43\n00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:01,517\nI use it all the time.\n\n44\n00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,715\nThere's no plus sign.\n\n45\n00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,586\nI can share my screen if you want to see it.\n\n46\n00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,502\nI've been having this problem for a few days now.\n\n47\n00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:19,852\nI wonder if your security has changed.\n\n48\n00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:20,966\nLet's see.\n\n49\n00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,864\nMR Chicago Northwest.\n\n50\n00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:29,520\nWhat database are you
