    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yes. My PCR, typically when I have the Outlook, it has up on top of the ribbon, you know, PC recruiter. I no longer can find that. Oh, okay. Can I get it back? Sure. Are you using Outlook Classic or are you using Outlook New? I think I'm using Classic, right? You've got to use Classic to be able to do this, right? Exactly. Yeah, we're only compatible with Classic. And then let's see. Do you have – let me check to see maybe if you have the latest Java and Launcher. This will probably be easiest if we could just jump on a quick screen share. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, hold on a second. Okay. What is it, meetings? Yeah, meetings.ringcentral.com. Let's see here. Hold on there. Something that came up here, RingCentral. Let's see here, hold on here, something that came up here, RingCentral. Once you get there, it should ask you for a meeting ID. Is that what it's showing on the screen? is it it's rings with an s uh no so it's uh well it's meetings with an s so meeting meetings period ring central.com yep Here it is. Okay. Okay, join meeting ID. Perfect. The meeting ID is 242-7-8. Okay, join meeting ID. Perfect. The meeting ID is 242-671-106. Perfect. So you joined there. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Allow while visiting the site. Allow this time. Yeah, you can allow while visiting this site. That will allow any screen sharing and then continue without audio if it asks about that. And then we'll just have you click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. And after you click on entire screen, it might need you to click on like screen one to highlight it and select it before hitting share there we go that's loading oh something out it started loading then it stopped you might have to click the share again the bottom try that again okay There we go, loading. Let's see. Awesome. I can see that. All right. So let's have you start by going to File in the main menu at the top. and okay that's a clue there in yellow there it says slow and disabled comm add-ins let's click on there where it says manage comm add-ins that might be what the issue is others kind of that button there manage comm add-ins It'd be the one above that, the one highlighted in yellow. Oh, the one you wanted slow and disabled. Okay. That one right there, manage com add-ins. And it'll open up a list of anything that it automatically disabled. And I'm wondering if PCR is on that list. Outlook came up. This is what came up. Is it on a different screen? Oh, there we go. Okay, yeah, you can close that. That might have been what popped up when you clicked on the first button, so you can close that out. Yeah, try clicking that one more time. There we go. PCR look is listed. That's probably the issue. Where it says options at the bottom there, click on the little arrow or triangle next to it, and then enable this add-on. Go ahead and click on that radio button and then apply. Okay, see what it's saying here. Certain system things it might hide from me. Okay, attempting the stream. Okay hit okay on that. And license experience okay not a problem let me just renew that for you but you can hit okay on that as well. and it should log you in. That's a good sign. Yeah. I was going to say when I usually open it up, that's what comes up at some point. It doesn't do it when it's not going to enable it. Okay. And then you can hit close on the pop-up here. And just hit the back button at the top left to get back to the main Outlook screen. There it is. It's back up there. There it is. Okay, excellent. And I'm glad I saw that your yearly renewal of that license, I'll just enter that now. It doesn't have anything to do with billing, but Microsoft just makes a hit renew, which account. So it said nine days, it'll make you renew it. I'll just do it now. So you have it for another year without bothering you with that message again. Cool. I think that's looking good on this end. Anything else you've been having trouble with, with PCR? No, that's fine. No, that's fine. Okay. Excellent. All right. We'll reach out if you need anything else. All right. Very good. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",
