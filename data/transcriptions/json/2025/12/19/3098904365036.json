So what do you mean by PC recruiter email? I have no idea. I've never worked with the woman. I've never talked to her. Her voicemail said, I need to see if I could get some help hooking my email up to the mobile device. And she said a PC recruiter email, so maybe it's PCR mail, or it could just be something that – I think it's just her email, because PCR mail, you can't hook up to anything. Yeah, it's just her email, but we don't really – like, our mobile app doesn't work with email. No, it uses whatever email you have set up on your device. yeah so I don't know even if there's anything we can do but just as a courtesy I wanted to throw in a ticket so someone could call and say oh yeah we can't do that or if it's easy maybe we can I don't know but she was just sounded really like really nice and she's like I just need some help it was a cane customer I've never worked with so I didn't know much gotcha okay I felt it looks like they use vario for their email so I'll give her a call and send her these instructions but But yeah, that's not like a – I don't think we're going to be able to do anything with that. I didn't think so, but I thought I'd throw it in just to be nice to her. Okay, perfect. I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page there. Yeah, I didn't think there was anything we could do, but just it was a voicemail, so I wanted to respond. All right, perfect. I'll give her a call. Thanks, sir. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
