    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Seekers Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, I have a couple questions. Number one, this morning on our team meeting, we were looking at a sample person's profile, and it said one recruiter had added that person to a roll-off, but it was not. It was a different recruiter who added it. What was the name of the test record? Let me look. Let me write it down. And the other piece to that, they said something about in SourceWale, like once they contact somebody and it stops the campaign, it marks it like the red X in the PCR roll-up. Does that sound right? So that would be however you have it set up in SourceWale. Okay. So I may have to go adjust the setting in there because we're using that red X as, like, if our researcher pulls people for a job and puts them in a funnel roll-up, and then the recruiter goes through and, like, audits them and pulls the people they want to keep into the master one, and the other ones they mark with a red X. so the researcher knows they're a no and so the people from source wheel are coming it's like marking them red x like they're a no but they're not necessarily a no so yeah that would be in the source integration setup okay i will look into that piece then um let me show you a sheet bill And then I'm going to spell the last name, M-C-G-I-L-L-I-V-R-A-Y. All right, let me take a look at this record. So where were you seeing that they were added? Yeah, let me pull this up here one sec. So if you go under roll-ups, it says added by Marcus, but Lisa added this person. Into the database? Onto a roll-up. So the add name activity is who created the record. Oh, okay. Then why does it say it was yesterday? Because this person has been in there. As far as I know. Because if you look back under activities, there are activities in here. Canada was created in 2021. The record I'm looking at was created 9-21-2025. Oh, September 21st. Okay. We're looking at that wrong then. I think we said September 21. We were reading that as 2020. Never mind. Okay. That makes sense. So that was yesterday. That answers that piece. But Lisa added the person. So why does it say Marcus added the person? Because Marcus said he did do some work last night, but it was after the time. And Lisa was like, I was in there getting marked. So I see things by Lisa, like other... But the name record was added by Marcus. But it wasn't is what I'm saying. And we don't know why it was marked Marcus instead of Lisa. It's another source whale thing? Because it says Marcus added a source whale. Okay. Let me take a look here. Yeah, because there was an API added. So if Marcus could have added them to source whale or something. So if Marcus added them to Source Whale, but Lisa added them into PCR, it's a Source Whale issue again. Yeah, so Marcus could have added them to Source Whale, and then if Lisa went to add them to PCR and saw that they were already there, because she did make some changes to the record. Okay. It would have said like, oh, there's a possible duplicate when Lisa creates the record. she could have just started working with the record that's already in the database. Yeah. Okay, all right. Sounds like I need to call SourceWheel. Second thing that's unrelated, Deanna wants me to create like a survey that can be attached to the link in everyone's email. is that something I can create through PCR to, like, track responses? Yes and no. Because I know, like, when we send out, like, a reference test, we can set up the options and stuff, which would be kind of like a survey. But that goes out as an email. I don't know if there's a way to use that as a link, like a hyperlink. So you could use it as like a hyperlink in an email, like you just insert that because that's essentially a PCR profile. The thing with profiles, though, is you can't just send it out to random people. They already need to be in your database. Okay, so that's not going to work. So maybe I need to work with our back office. people who take care of our email and see what choices they have. Yeah. Like even if you have like a website, a lot of times whoever hosts your domain, same people. Yeah. They can essentially create like a hidden page on your website where you can't get to it normally to fill out a survey. It's just like a page that they go to fill out and then you can be notified via email when it's completed. Okay. All right. I will work with the back office on that one then. I just wasn't sure if there was some way we could do it through PCR or not. You could, but like I said, you just have to send it to people that are in the database. You can't just send it to everyone because then it won't work properly. We only send out to people who are in here? So then you could do it that way. I just didn't know if there were, like, I know some people that when they send through SourceWale, especially, there will be names, like, that are on the SourceWale list that may not necessarily be NPC recruiter yet. Yeah, our newsletters are very specific, and it only goes to people who are NPCR who are on, we have asked to be, if they want to be on the newsletter. Okay. And they're all on like a roll-up, but what Deanna was envisioning in her head was that there was some link in everyone's email signature saying, click here to fill out this survey, and then it takes you to fill out the survey. You think that's still a better bet to try to do through our website somehow? Yes. Okay. Okay. It'd be nice if it tracks the survey records back to each person's individual profile, but I might be making up something that's impossible. Yeah, it's just with the profile links. Let me test that real quick. You might be able to individually, those might go out individually. Because how would it know, like if I got an email from Deanna and I click on the link to do the survey, how would it know to send the results to my profile? I'm making up something that wouldn't work. Let me try this here. Thank you. I'm seeing if that's even an option for the email signatures. Because I know it's an option to insert the profile link in the... Oh, yeah. That's not even an option to be able to put into the email signature. It would have to be in a form letter that you send out. Okay. Okay, so I'm back to this website idea then. Yeah, that would probably be the best bet. Okay. Where it just like takes you to... Like a hidden webpage that we can check back in. We can see the like, the group to results. Yep. Okay. Awesome. All right. thank you yep not a problem you have a great day you too bye bye",

help you?\n\n4\n00:00:06,163 --> 00:00:07,740\nHey, I have a couple questions.\n\n5\n00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,121\nNumber one,\n\n6\n00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:12,264\nthis morning on our team meeting,\n\n7\n00:00:12,284 --> 00:00:15,407\nwe were looking at a sample person's profile,\n\n8\n00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:21,213\nand it said one recruiter had added that person to a roll-off,\n\n9\n00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:21,653\nbut it was not.\n\n10\n00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,579\nIt was a different recruiter who added it.\n\n11\n00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:34,773\nWhat was the name of the test record?\n\n12\n00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,340\nLet me look.\n\n13\n00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:38,179\nLet me write it down.\n\n14\n00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,301\nAnd the other piece to that,\n\n15\n00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:42,683\nthey said something about in SourceWale,\n\n16\n00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:45,146\nlike once they contact somebody and it stops the campaign,\n\n17\n00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:46,448\nit marks it like the red X in the PCR roll-up.\n\n18\n00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,496\nDoes that sound right?\n\n19\n00:00:56,902 --> 00:01:00,340\nSo that would be however you have it set up in SourceWale.\n\n20\n00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:02,026\nOkay.\n\n21\n00:01:06,063 --> 00:01:09,406\nSo I may have to go adjust the setting in there because we're using that red X as,\n\n22\n00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:09,526\nlike,\n\n23\n00:01:09,586 --> 00:01:14,671\nif our researcher pulls people for a job and puts them in a funnel roll-up,\n\n24\n00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:16,753\nand then the recruiter goes through and,\n\n25\n00:01:16,773 --> 00:01:16,873\nlike,\n\n26\n00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:20,417\naudits them and pulls the people they want to keep into the master one,\n\n27\n00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,740\nand the other ones they mark with a red X.\n\n28\n00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,984\nso the researcher knows they're a no and so the people from source wheel are coming\n\n29\n00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:34,866\nit's like marking them red x like they're a no but they're not necessarily a no so\n\n30\n00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:42,790\nyeah that would be in the source integration setup okay i will look into that piece\n\n31\n00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,073\nthen um let me show you a sheet bill And then I'm going to spell the last name,\n\n32\n00:01:47,153 --> 00:01:47,873\nM-C-G-I-L-L-I-V-R-A-Y.\n\n33\n00:02:03,828 --> 00:02:05,118\nAll right, let me take a look at this record.\n\n34\n00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,554\nSo where were you seeing that they were added?\n\n35\n00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,707\nYeah, let me pull this up here one sec.\n\n36\n00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,272\nSo if you go under roll-ups, it says added by Marcus, but Lisa added this person.\n\n37\n00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:36,795\nInto the database?\n\n38\n00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:38,732\nOnto a roll-up.\n\n39\n00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,450\nSo the add name activity is who created the record.\n\n40\n00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:50,177\nOh, okay.\n\n41\n00:02:50,743 --> 00:02:53,080\nThen why does it say it was yesterday?\n\n42\n00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:54,250\nBecause this person has been in there.\n\n43\n00:02:58,127 --> 00:02:59,300\nAs far as I know.\n\n44\n00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,596\nBecause if you look back under activities, there are activities in here.\n\n45\n00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,667\nCanada was created in 2021.\n\n46\n00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,484\nThe record I'm looking at was created 9-21-2025.\n\n47\n00:03:20,762 --> 00:03:21,265\nOh, September 21st.\n\n48\n00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,190\nOkay.\n\n49\n00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,680\nWe're looking at that wrong then.\n\n50\n00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:29,720\nI think we said September 21.\n\n51\n00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,256\nWe were reading that as 2020.\n\n52\n00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,240\nNever mind.\n\n53\n00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:33,557\nOkay.\n\n54\n00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,195\nThat makes sense.\n\n55\n00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:35,600\nSo that was yesterday.\n\n56\n00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:36,920\nThat answers that piece.\n\n57\n00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,966\nBut Lisa added the person.\n\n58\n00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,854\nSo why does it say Marcus added the person?\n\n59\n00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,675\nBecause Marcus said he did do some work last night, but it was after the time.\n\n60\n00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,180\nAnd Lisa was like, I was in there getting marked.\n\n61\n00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,345\nSo I see things by Lisa, like other...\n\n62\n00:04:02,482 --> 00:04:05,259\nBut the name record was added by Marcus.\n\n63\n00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,850\nBut it wasn't is what I'm saying.\n\n64\n00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:12,157\nAnd we don't know why it was marked Marcus instead of Lisa.\n\n65\n00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,331\nIt's another source whale thing?\n\n66\n00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:27,599\nBecause it says Marcus added a source whale.\n\n67\n00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:27,783\nOkay.\n\n68\n00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:30,237\nLet me take a look here.\n\n69\n00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,087\nYeah, because there was an API added.\n\n70\n00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,166\nS",
