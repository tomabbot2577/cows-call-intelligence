    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Good morning. It's Mike McLean with META. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Hey, I was going through the email about upgrading our database to the Lucian. Okay, yeah. Yeah, so just a couple questions. So with that upgrade, that's all done in the background, right? You said it could take up to about 24 hours or so? Right, so we'll have our tech team switch over to Lucene, and then the 24-hour time block would be for the re-indexing of your database to kind of match the Lucene tools. Oh, okay. But that wouldn't affect any of our users in working in the database while they upgrade to the – how do you pronounce it? Lucene? Lucene. Lucene. Lucene. Yeah. It would not function, like the quick search at the top right of PCR would not function while the re-indexing is going on. But you could still use basic search on the left. It's just that quick search bar up at the top will really be functioning during re-indexing. Okay. Could we re-index? So we start to re-index towards the end of the day so that by morning it should be good to go? Yeah, maybe I'll put a note in there. Or like on a Friday if it's during the week. I just don't want to affect any of the users. That makes sense. Yeah, I'll add an end note for our tech team. The preference there, that's a good idea. Okay. And then, yeah, you'd mentioned that the management hasn't decided yet as to what they were going to do, like if it's going to be part of our package or is it going to be additional? Oh, for the, at least just for the trial. We don't know a timeframe of the trial, but they are currently, every customer has the three basic AI tools. And then by request, we can get the Lucene upgrade and the AI search. Those will all be free of cost. And it's just, yeah, the timeframe they haven't really shared with us how long the trial goes for. Okay, but they're not looking at charging extra for these features. It's just the... They would, yeah, they would charge extra for these features after the free trial is over. And you would just need to talk to your account rep, Jim Lombardo, to say, yes, I do want to actually keep these or get them installed permanently onto my databases for the charge. But we won't automatically charge you or anything. It's not one of those free trials where you forget that you signed up and then you start getting charged. We'll turn it off from your account if you haven't reached out saying that you want to get charged. Yeah. Well, no, and I'm just, I guess I'm just questioning. So if there's something that's going to be additional charges, is why are you allowing all the users to try them out? And then basically after the trial, you're going to be like, no, you're not paying for them, you're taking them all away. So we already pay for, especially like the database itself, like we already have, you know, pay per user. So how does that roll out that, you know, you're going to allow features and then pull them back again? It's kind of more just, yeah, like the free trial idea where you could try it, see if you're interested, see if this is something you would like before purchasing it instead of not being able to experience it and then putting in the money to purchase it. So you get like a test of it, taste of it first so that you know if it's something you actually do want to buy. And again, I don't know, you guys, how you re-rolled it out. Any other platform that we have, If there's a trial that's going to be a paid feature to add on later, it's something that we have to request to add. So it wouldn't just be something. So like all those three features that are currently in the database that all the users can access right now, any other platform that we have that's online, they would only enroll that out if we, kind of like the search feature. We have to come to you guys and say, hey, we want to try this free trial out, blah, blah, blah. The only reason, Garrett, I'm bringing it up is because if we have users that use it and they're like, oh yeah, this is a great feature, but now it's additional cost and it's a little bit out of our financial realm. Now these users have already experienced it, touched it, tried it, and now you pull away the features again after. So that's my only tidbit there on that. Any other platform, like I said, we've had to reach out to them and say, hey, can you add these features for us to try for a month or whatever it is? and then, okay, they add the features. Just because I didn't even realize that this was part of the database, one of our users had already started playing around with it. And they said, hey, have you seen this? I just wanted to touch base. And I didn't even know that it was part of PCR, to be honest. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I will reach out to Jim, though, and see what kind of costs are involved in adding. So it's all the features they're going to charge for, like not just that search feature? Yeah, I think it would be just the AI package in general. It's just all together, yeah. And since you're in the free trial timeframe asking for the Lucene upgrade, Lucene will be a free upgrade and it'll remain free. That won't be turned back to your older search engine model. It'll stay at Lucene. Awesome. So that's definitely a benefit for this time period. Okay. And one last question, Garrett. Any word about PCR10? Yeah, so, yeah, it's called PCRM, and we have a few users that are getting demos of it now. I think there was, like, an update on the PCR login screen with, you know, maybe a little blog article about that. But if you're interested, when you talk to Jim Lombardo, ask him for a PCRM demo, and he can give you all the options there of adding that to your account. One thing about PCRM is that you will be getting it in addition to your current version, like PCR9, so that it's the same database, just two options of the interface. that you can use. Right. Like, I do have, I talked to, geez, I'm going to say it was Nick, maybe. And he had set it up originally with the beta. So we've been on the PCR test. A few of our users have access to the PCR 10 beta testing, but I don't notice any different of like, like I'm on it right now and it says, I don't see PCR M. Like, would there be somewhere that it... So, yeah. Is there somewhere that it shows? I don't see anything differently. Let me log in. It might not say the words PCRM. I'm just going to go to mine real quick. No, yeah. It doesn't say PCRM. Okay. I thought maybe at the top left it would, but no, it just says PCR. So if you're on the 10 beta is what they were calling it, they've just kind of done a rebranding to call it PCRM. So you do have access. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I play around in it periodically here when I set up users and stuff. But any word as to when that's going to be pushed out as like the new platform? So, yeah, it's currently being pushed out and we're going to keep it both available. PCR 9 and PCRM so that certain users, maybe admin users, would like the PCR 9 version to go in and do things like CSV imports, for example, is in PCR 9 but not in PCRM, the kind of the streamlined version. So we're going to plan to, I guess, just planning to keep both of them available. And they're both rolled out right now, available for people to add in the PCRM interface to their current package. Okay. So that PCRM, is it still just in beta? Or we could actually have our users start using that as a regular platform to work on? I think, yeah, I think at this point, since I think you guys were special, You were one of the few people who were on the beta. So I don't know if maybe Nick was supposed to reach out to you and let you know that the PCRM, it's like fully available to everyone else. So I'll just drop a note to him and make sure that everything's good. Having, you know, having you get all those users that you need to onto the PCRM version. But I believe, yeah, it's totally fine to have other people on it at this point. I'll just drop Nick a note. Yeah, please do. I know I've played around with it. I know one of our ECR specialists, Sheila, she had access. I don't know if she's played around too much. But, yeah, I was just under the impression it was still beta. So if we can move over. And I don't know if there's anything we need to do on our end or we could just use the new URL and kind of deploy it that way. but yeah okay yeah that's you can make a note and let me know yeah that'd be great okay perfect yeah i'll just say i'm wondering okay yeah um if they need to do anything else yeah that makes sense um i'll have yeah nick either call you or get back to you uh via email just making sure yeah that's perfect email and the clean it group okay awesome anything else i can help with today No, so the database upgrade, once that's completed, they'll just send me a note or let me know? Yeah, we'll let you know Lucene's been switched over, and then probably at the same time, they'll switch on the AI search, and so they'll let you know that both of those things are on. Perfect. Well, thanks for your help, Garrett. Appreciate it. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else. Everybody have a good one. Thank you.",
