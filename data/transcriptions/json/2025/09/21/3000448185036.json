    "text": " Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Susanna Fairbanks, Owens Medical Placement. I put a ticket in last night. I'm unable to send calendar invites, and I just wondered if you could help me. Sure. Let me log into your database. Are you in the IT-Tech or OMP recruiters? OMP recruiters, yes. Okay. And what's your username? Hang on, let me see what I am. S Fairbanks, I think. Hang on. I think I'm S Fairbanks. Let me just refresh and I can tell you what I am. Hang on. Reload. Hang on a sec. I am SF. S as in Sam, F as in Frank. Okay. Perfect. I'm logged in there. and so where are you in PCR when you're trying to send the requests? I am going to a position I'm going to Atlanta Massimo the company the position and I'm going to the pipeline and then I want to send a meeting invite out through the pipeline for a zoom a phone call and then when I add the step, put the date in, which is Thursday, the 3rd of July. The time is 2.30 p.m., and then I save step, and then I go to email the candidate and the hiring manager. I put the candidate's name in there. The name pops up with the email, and then it stops. On the right there it says send to where it has checkboxes where you can select the candidate rather than typing it in the to field. That might help as well. So if you're in the bottom half of that pop-up window where it says send email, you have on the right where it says send to and you have the candidate and the contact listed there with checkboxes. Yes, yes. And when I tick that checkbox, and then only half of the email address goes into the field. It's really strange. oh um yeah so i go email yeah so i'm typing the candidate's name in it goes in and then it goes straight to that box and then if i select and put a check mark then and put select in i hit select nothing happens Okay, I might be looking at something different then. Okay, so if you are at the add step pop-up window, we're still on that same window, right? Add step, okay. Go back to add step. Okay, I'm going to add step. I'm going to go to the date. Perfect. 3rd of July. I'm going to go to 2.30 p.m. Perfect. Right? And then I hit save step, correct? Right? Not yet, because I think you want to send an email at the bottom half there, right? Or no, you're not sending an email from this screen, you're sending it from a different screen. Yes, I am. I always go to save step and then I go to email. Is that right? Okay, send an email. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, bottom half of the screen, you can still send the email out this way without leaving the screen before saving steps. Oh, yes. Okay. Collect. Okay. Okay. Okay, and now I hit close, correct? Not yet. So you would choose a template of an email. Are you typing out the email on the fly or are you using a form letter that you're sending out? A template, yeah. I want to go to the template. Okay, yeah, use that dropdown to select the template. Write under send email. Okay, hang on a second. Oh, add interview type. Okay, sorry. I don't normally do it this way. Where do I normally go to select the template if I'm on the add step? I found it. I found it. I found it. Okay, I found it, hang on. Okay, phone screen, okay. I've got phone screen and now I hit save step, correct? Not yet, there's still another button for send as meeting request. Is that what you wanted to do, have this go out as a meeting request when the email was sent? Yes, it's going to be a Zoom meeting, but I don't have that template. We just do, I just do a phone screen confirmation and then I change the wording once I get to it. Oh, okay. So you don't want this one to be a meeting request, maybe a future email you want as a meeting request? Yeah, it's a, I've selected the phone screen confirmation. Oh, okay. And then I, can I hit save step and then I can change it? No, so Savestep will actually send the email immediately. Oh, okay. No, I don't want that. Yeah, if you scroll down, you'll see the actual letter typed out that you selected. Oh, I see. Yeah, got it. Okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to have to change the name a bit. Okay. So it doesn't automatically put the time in for me, does it? So if you choose a time and date up above and then you have the insert field for like, I think the insert field code is like interview appointment date, interview appointment time, are those inserted? Yeah, so they won't be visible but you will, the recipient will see those filled in based on the date and time you selected up above. Okay. Even though they're underlined in red, interview appointment time, interview appointment date. Okay. So I just need to change the wording one sec. Okay. This is a different way of doing meeting advice. I don't normally do it this way. But I'm happy to do it this way going forward. But let me just, can I just, okay, so I'm just going to change it just to say for virtual meeting. Okay. Virtual meeting details. Okay. And then Megan Honeycutt will send link prior to that. Let me just change it a bit. Hang on. No problem. Send link prior to the designated time listed above. I'm just going to put the candidate's email address in. Hang on. Just for visual. Hang on one sec. Victoria Curry 1026 at Gmail. Victoria Curry 1026 at Gmail. Okay. Okay. Okay, so that is... Okay, that's good. 2.30 Eastern time. Do I then have to put what time I'm on somewhere? So you can add in another time if it's not going to be that time up at the top that you selected. It's going to be a meeting invite for people on the East Coast, so it's 2.30 on the East Coast. Do I have to put in my time, central time, as I'm the sender? Oh, let me think here. Because normally I go to another field and I put in the time that I'm in. Right, yeah. So this is going to be connected to your username. So, yeah, I would choose your current time zone when selecting the time and date above. So I should say. I'm going to do a test. Let's see. What time zone are you in? I'm in central. Central. Okay. So if I add my name to a pipeline here in your database, and I'm going to kind of mimic what you do and I'll see what I see as a recipient. Let me just see if I might already be in your database possibly from other support. There we go. Yep. So I'm going to put myself into a pipeline here. Let me position. and I'm going to add step and I'm going to choose okay so the date and time I'm going to choose is just let's say Monday at 1 p.m. and it should go by central time because that's your username and then let's see send to what is the name of the template that you're sending? Oh, it's phone screen confirmation. It's on the bottom. A interview phone screen confirm. Okay. Send it to me and see below for phone screen details. Okay, got that. Awesome. And then I will just send this to myself really quick here. Okay, yeah, no worries. Take your time. see what it looks like as a recipient okay see all right and then let me check my inbox go so I sent it for 1 p.m. and then me as a recipient I'm seeing at 12 p.m. because I'm Eastern. So just send things in your time zone and it will adjust for the recipient as they open the email. Oh, okay. So I should make it for 1.30 when it's actually 2.30, right? Right. Okay. So I'm going to make the appointment date for 1.30 on July the 3rd, and that will go to both of the candidates who are on the East Coast and the manager, that will go as 230, correct? Right. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, I think that... Delete myself. Because normally I would go somewhere... You know, honestly, this is a totally new way of doing this for me. I'm sorry. I've been probably doing it the long, long, long, long, wrong way for years. Oh, no worries. Yeah. Hopefully it's a little bit of a shortcut for you. Yeah. Okay. so I guess I'm just going to send this out. I think it's Megan Heineckart, Victoria Chiroulis. Okay. Okay. And then there is a button right above where you can select the contacts that you're sending to that says send as meeting request. Was that part of the initial question? Oh, yeah. Send as meeting request. Yeah. I should select that. Yeah. Does it let you click on that? No, it doesn't. No. Not available without selecting schedule? Oh, so all that means is up above where you chose the date and time, there's a little checkbox to place it on your PCR schedule. And once it's placed on your PCR schedule, it becomes an actual meeting, and that way it can be sent as a meeting request. That's up to you, though, if you want to place it on your own PCR schedule or not. Oh, I've never used my PCR schedule. You know, there's so much shit I don't know about. I've been using this software for 10 years. I think I need to have training club. Okay, so I can pick the schedule. Yeah, if you check that box, it'll put the schedule box, it'll put it on your PCR schedule, and that won't be a big deal either way because you mentioned you don't really use it. Okay, so now I'm going to go down to send meeting, send us meeting request, right? Okay, got it. Exactly, yeah. Okay. All right, so that will move the person to the step, put an appointment on your schedule, and send an email all from one screen. Oh, wow. Okay. All right. So it's saying 1.30. I hope it's going to say 2.30 for them. I believe you. Right. Yeah. No, that works in the test for me. So awesome. Okay. So I'm going to save step and that will automatically send it? Yep. Okay. So save step. Okay. Okay. All right. going okay okay awesome all right I guess it went okay I'll check with the candidate make sure she got it on her right time zone sending email could not connect email alias username and password okay so you need to probably reconnect your username to your email provider so I can help with that let's I think this is what the problem has been all along this is why I couldn't send any invites history. There's something going on that's not right. So if you go back to your main PCR screen, your main tab at the top there, and then at the top right go to, there's like a little gear icon drop-down menu right by the profile picture at the top right. Yeah, the three dots? No, it's like a gear icon. So you have, yeah, top right of PCR there's a profile picture. Oh yeah, the gear. Yes, got it. The gear. And in that drop-down menu, email is the first option. Go ahead and... Yeah, that's how I go to my email every day. Yeah. Perfect, yeah. So PCR mail opens in a new tab. And then go to configure at the top left. Top left, configure, hang on. Personal trash, outlook, head contacts. Am I looking in the right field? Yeah, it's kind of right above that. Oh yeah, configure, configure. Sorry, yes, the gear box. Yeah, no problem. Okay, got it, got it. And then go to alias address list. Alias address list, got it. And then in the bottom frame, click the pencil icon. Got it. And this will show you your connection there. Just hit test connection at the bottom. If it's showing red lettering, that means there's something wrong. But if it's showing green lettering, you're in good shape. It says it's all black lettering and the bottom is in green status and then test completed. Oh, it's green. Okay, so it is connected. Interesting. All right, let me just try to send myself one email. I'm going to go, still logged in as you. I'm going to my name record saying PCR support test. out email. Okay, let's see. Okay, it says it's sent. Let me see if I can get it in my inbox. It went right to my inbox. Interesting. I wonder why it won't let you send an email. Yeah. What is... All right, so the... What was the name of the candidate that you were trying to send an email to? Victoria Chirolis, C-H-E-R-O-L-I-S. Victoria Chirolis. Okay, found her there. I see. Her email address is missing. a period, so it's gmail.com instead of gmail.com on her record, so that's why I won't be able to send. You'll have to adjust the email address on that record. Is the wrong email address populated? Yeah, it should be gmail.com. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But that wasn't me. That was like... Let me see. Okay, let me go back to the candidate. Hang on. Name. So that's the whole reason why it never went? Right, yeah. So none of the emails were sending. Victoria, hang on, VictoriaCurry1026, C-U-R-Y 1026, at gmail.com. Okay, and hit save. I'm going to hit save. Perfect. Save name. Okay, that was the problem all along, you think. That was just what it was. Yeah, I believe that'll fix it. And so the email didn't go out to Victoria that you just sent. So you can redo that and it should send or you can do it the way you're used to. But now you have that other option of doing all that in one screen. If you want. That's kind of cool. Well, you had the other option. Yeah. OK, I need to learn that more. I need to sign up for some training courses. I know you guys still do them, right? You just do training classes, right? For people. Yeah, absolutely. just reach out anytime whenever you want to schedule one of those we can get you trained up on whatever topic I think that's what the problem was it was just her email address I was able to send other emails but that one I think I'm good if I'm not good I'll call you back alright sounds good have a great rest of your day what's your name again I'm sorry my name's Garrett Garrett thank you so much for your time no problem have a good one bye",
