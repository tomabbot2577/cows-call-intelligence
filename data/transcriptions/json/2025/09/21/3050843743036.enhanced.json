    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. My name is Vern. And we have PCR. And I'm actually, I'm sorry, I should say I need technical support. Is that something you can help me with? Yes. What's your last name? Saul, S-H-A-U-L-L. Okay. With the Newell Group? Yes, ma'am. Okay, what can I help you with? So I was having trouble with this before, parsing resumes from Microsoft Outlook, and I just had to replace my computer a week ago, and today they gave us their, you know, went in and set my system back up. So I'm back to the problem of not being able to parse resumes. Okay, probably missing some apps. Any chance you have RingCentral? I do. You do? Okay. easier to screen share them that way. Okay, if you open up your RingCentral app... Alright. Um... Then... Let me know when you're there. I'm not there. Because I'm trying to find it and I can't find it. It used to be on my toolbar down at the bottom. And it's not there now. Have you reinstalled it since you're your new computer I don't know if you go to your Windows search option type the word ring okay and then do you see ring central with the word app underneath it yep okay click on that click on that or click open either way it'll open it for you. All right. Okay. All right. So you should be in your app, I assume? Not yet. It's installing. I'm just going to warn you, I'm not very tech savvy. Okay. Okay. Alright. I've got a window that popped up. Actually, I'm going to close that. Alright. I found it on my toolbar on the second monitor and I clicked on that and opened it up. Okay. So I have the app open. Okay. So once the app is open, you're going to go to video at the top left. Okay. And then select join. All right. And then it's going to ask you for a meeting ID number. Meeting ID number. Are you ready for that? Yep. Okay. Okay, 050-394-810. Okay. Now, what will happen once it's putting you in, it's also going to ask you about joining computer audio. Don't join with computer audio since we're already on the phone. Okay. Except the cookies. Yeah, I guess that's okay. I'm going to have you click share at the bottom of your screen and then go over to entire screen and you'll select on which screen to show. I'm sorry say that again. click share make sure you're under entire screen a tire screen entire screen oh I'm sorry that's okay sorry all right okay so I clicked on entire screen okay then you're gonna click on what screen to show. Okay, I'm going to slide you over to my main window. Bear with me one second. It's easier to see if I show you on my bigger monitor. Okay. All right. So there's a couple things that you might be missing. Can we do this? Can you go down to the bottom of your Windows app? I'm sorry, down to your Windows search option, just to the left of all those apps that are listed, and type the word app, A-P-P, into the search box. I don't see a search box. You were just down there. Your cursor is down at the bottom. Type the word app in there. Okay, all right. Okay, see where it says system settings? Go ahead and click on that. Okay, click apps over at the left and then go to installed apps which is the first choice at the top right. Okay, so I'm going to have you scroll down to the J's. We're going to make sure you have Java, which is also going to be needed. Okay, don't have that, it looks like. And then let's go down to the P's. And we're going to look for P's Recruiter Launcher as well as P's Recruiter Portal. I think you're going to be missing both. Okay. All right. So we got three things to install. Okay. So let's close out of this window. And might as well close out. look or actually you know what while we're here let's go file up at the top left go to options because if this is new a new setup we might have to show something here okay go to options see where it says optimize for best appearance over at the right and that pop-up window okay you're going to flip Flip that to optimize for compatibility. Okay. Okay. Then you're going to go to add-ins in that gray sidebar at the left. And while we're here, let's click go down at the bottom. And the one I want to at least have you turn off is when it says social connector 2016. That one seems to take a lot of memory. And if you don't use OneNote within your Outlook, you can turn off that one too. but at least do social connector. Okay, let's hit okay. Is OneNote the same as, what do we use, where multiple computers talk to each other? No, it's almost like sticky notes, but in your Outlook. Wow. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, okay. Okay. At least the social connector one seems to help. Let's hit okay. All right. And then let's go file and choose exit. Okay, let's go down exit. All right, so we're out of Outlook for now. What I'm going to have you do is open up a browser, and you're probably, like, having issues with alarms and opening, like, resumes, attachments, a whole bunch of stuff. So these installs I'm going to give you are going to fix all that. Okay, first one we're going to do is java.com, J-A-V-A.com. Download Java for desktops. Download Java for desktops again. It's kind of in the middle there. Okay, then you're going to open and run that file. Click yes. Oh is it that does this about changing apps changing device or whatever yeah hit yes there that's one screen that it won't let me see for security okay here we're going to hit install All right. Hit close. Okay then next one we're going to do if you can go to your Peace recruiter login page but don't actually log in yet okay so I'm already logged in you want me to log out yeah we're gonna need to log out anyway so might as well all right okay so go to the login page but don't actually log in. Okay, so down at the bottom left, see where it says Launch or Install? Where it says Windows? Over at the very bottom left. It'll say Launch or Install, Windows and Mac. Look at where it says Windows. Okay, gotcha. Click Windows? Yep. So that's going to download another file. So we're going to open that one and you'll see the same about device okay hit next I accept and then next typical and then install and then finish okay I'm going to have you so this isn't going to do anything with the outlook just yet but just PCR viewing through your browser go ahead and log in to PCR yep okay now first time you go in you're gonna see a couple prompts I'm going to guide you through that so you don't see them all the time see where it says always allow that's your browser wanting to know is it okay to run that launcher program that we just installed click the box that says always allow then click open then you're going to get prompted by allowing an update go ahead and hit allow right okay so if you're having a problem just even an opening attachment PCR that's going to fix that okay or using like the add resume screen and the quick add option or from a company let's at least fix that okay and then where it says don't show me this guide in the future go ahead and check that box and then say skip so next time you log in you won't get all these extra prompts okay so the main reason you called those you needed the piece recruiter portal add-in for Outlook correct uh-huh okay so let's go to maybe that first tab where you downloaded Java we just need to go to a different tab and I'm gonna have you go in and replace up at the top type in PC recruiter downloads up there where yeah yeah actually hold on one second I'm going to do something else although shoot this computer is probably I have to Okay. Yeah, go ahead and go to Peace Recruiter Downloads. Okay. Okay. Go to that link that says Downloads Peace Recruiter. All right. And then you're going to scroll down a little bit. And where it says PC Recruiter from Microsoft Outlook, see under green, Download PCR for Outlook? Uh-huh. Go ahead and download that. Okay. Now, I might have to do something on my side, which might take a moment. So let me see that here. Are you located in Ohio as well? Yes. Cleveland area? Like outside of Cleveland. Yep. The last person I talked to, he said he was up there. So I was just wondering. Yeah. You're from where? I'm sorry. I still didn't catch it. What was it? Wapakoneta. Oh. Do you know where Lima is? Kind of. Yeah, over on the west side of the state. Yeah. My sister lives out that way. She's in Delphos. So she always says she has to go either like Fort Wayne, Lima or something like that to go to a store. Yeah. So Wapakoneta is just south of Lima, right on I-75, and it's the home of Neil Armstrong. Oh. First name on the moon. I know that name at least. Yep. Okay, let's see. Let me just check something here. So there's going to be a serial number, and I just want to make sure that we won't have any issues with that number. So bear with me one second. the URL group. Okay, portal serial number. I'm so sorry. This part takes a moment. No, that's no problem. I just want to make sure we get there. It's not going to be like giving an expired message because, I don't know, it's either expired or actually it's about to expire so my probably good thing I'm in here August 13th 2026 also going to clear out some old connections for you because the other thing that happens if people haven't connected a route still takes up a spot actually i'll have one second here Thank you. Yeah, there's definitely some licensing stuff that needs to be cleaned up with this. I'm doing it for you now. The portal stuff is all kind of different. Wow, gotcha. Okay. All right, that'll get us at least clean when we get to that point. Okay, so bear with me. I'm going to go back to watching your screen now. Sorry about that. No problem. Okay, so stay down. Okay, so you're going to open that file. All right. And you'll see that. Do you want this app to make changes again? Hit yes. It's basically saying, is it okay to install this? Okay, here you're going to hit next. I accept, and then next. Next again. Install. And then finish. All right. Okay. All right. What I'm going to have you do now, let me pull this up on my other screen because I will need that number. They just hit a reset for you. Excuse me. Okay. And going back to your meeting window. I'm going to have you now open up Outlook. And you're immediately going to get prompted for a number. It's going to be pretty long. so bear with me when we get there. All right. Okay. The number is... Because it's long, I like to paste it and then start kind of separating it. 7-3-4-4. Okay. 9-5-2-9. Okay. 11-74. Okay. 484. All right. And then click okay. All right. And you want me to read it back to you? Nope. I can see it. Okay. I think you did good. All right. Okay. No. It can't be expired. All right. Click it again. I literally just saved that. Hold on one second. Let me make sure. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and save that. really just save that hold on one second let me make sure oh I know what I did 26, sorry. 26, sorry. Okay. Now I think I have it right. Okay. All right. Let's click. Actually, let's do this. Go over to your PCR login page. So I have to open up your browser or go back to your browser for a moment. Okay. And yeah, go and click that tab. And I'm going to have you copy the URL that takes you to your database what you see at the top there the WW2 piece recruiter copy that whole thing perfect okay let's go back over to your Outlook and see that second window that let's go back hover on the Outlook icon down below go to that second window that's popped up there we go okay click Add connection replace a block about blank I clear that out and replace that with the link that you just copied perfect click OK select your database name make sure you pick the right one that you normally log into? I'm guessing it's this one. Go ahead and pick it for now. That way you just don't lose it. Go back to your login page or like over to your browser where you're actually logged in. Down at the bottom your browser. That's okay. Is that it? No I think it was over at the left. I think you were in Edge. Yeah. Okay yeah go. Okay yeah I could get the top where it has your username and then like it says vShall and then that's the database name. So username, database name. So that's what we're gonna need. Okay let's hover back on the Outlook icon but go that second icon. That one? Or yeah actually third okay type in your PCR username and then you'll need your PCR password Oh. Okay. Okay, hit log in. This is going to ask you about syncing your calendar. That's up to you. Or do you want to do it from, like, in both directions, not at all, or maybe just PCR to Outlook? I have no idea what that is. So if you put something on your PCR schedule, like let's say you write an activity and there's a follow up, that'll go to your PCR schedule. Would you want it to show up on your Outlook calendar? Or do you just keep it separate? Yeah, I've never used the PCR schedule. Okay, so they'll go ahead and hit no. All right. And then here, this would be for your email activity writing. So what they'll do, like, are you already set up? You have analytics. Do you know if you're already set up for PCR mail? I have never used it. Okay. Go ahead and hit yes there then. Sounds like a good tool. Okay. See where it says remember my password? Click that checkbox, but then retype your password again. So that way every time you open Outlook, you're not prompted for your password. Okay. And then before we save, let's hit test connection at the top, and we should hopefully get something that says success. Okay. Hit okay. Hit save and close. Okay. Let's try going over to your main window of Outlook. Okay. this is the same thing you asked about using your option or hit always allow okay open and then where it says don't show me again check that box and hit skip okay so now if you go over to somebody's email that maybe has a resume or that does have a resume now you should be able to right click on the file okay and you get your options now all right and you should be all set all right perfect now um can i ask you about um so where's pcr pcr so what's this uh calendar and email stuff so the calendar stuff is just like if you you know when you're in the add activity screen how there's the option to put a follow-up that just goes to your PCR schedule look if you click schedule up at the top there yeah okay so see how you have some things on your schedule uh-huh so would you want this schedule to sync over to your outlook calendar if you rather just keep it separate that's up to you it looks like maybe you've done this in the past possibly there's some recaps in there these kind of look like recurring so if you don't use it at all then i would just not sync it then okay all right and then what was the other email i see you have analytics so if you if you're using analytics the only way to get like the replies and bounces would be to set up for pcr mail so I don't know if you are for that. Can you go to the gear icon at the very top right? The what icon? The gear icon at the very top right of Peace Recruiter. Okay. Yeah, go in there. Select email. Yeah, you're not set up for incoming to come in here. Okay. So if you don't want to be set up here, I mean, you don't have to be, but if you're doing mail campaigns, you'd want to be. So, yes, I do do mail campaigns. Okay. So let's go to configure. Do you know who hosts your email? Is it like Office 365 or Gmail? I think it's Office 365. Okay. Let's go to configure. And let's go to alias address list. That's for sending email. I just want to see if you have anything in there just to even start. OK. Oh, you've got a Sun Grid one. OK. The new group. That's your default alias list. Let's see. I'm not sure who hosts your email. Then we probably ought to just leave it alone for right now. Okay. Yeah, you're sending through SendGrid, but to really get the full campaign data stats, If you're sending it as a mail campaign, you would have to be set up where it also downloads the email into PCR mail. So you'll get an activity. It's just you won't get any campaign data. But I don't know who your mail server is. You probably have to confirm with your tech person what your incoming and outgoing mail server is. I went to a site called MX Toolbox. Usually they'll tell me like Office 365 or Google, but it's not giving me that. So I'm not really sure who it is. Okay. I'll check with our – Yeah, so it's not about server data, so I'm not exactly sure. Okay. All right. But you should be good to go for now. At least you do have the Outlook add-in writing activities for you. Okay, good. All right. I appreciate it so much. No problem. Have a great week. All right. You too. All righty. And go Bengals. Oh, go Bronx. My wife. We try. Yeah, my wife's family is all Browns fans, but I'm a Bengals fan. I like Joe Burrow. I'd rather have him than Sean Watson. I'd rather have almost anybody than the Sean Watson, we'll just say. I don't think if Sean Watson is ever going to play in the NFL again, he's definitely not going to play for the Browns. Oh, God, I wish that was the case. He is. He's injured, and he won't be back until after this season, and then they're going to cut him before they have to pay him. So he's pretty much done. That would be nice. Worst trade ever. Yeah, I think. Everybody said that. Yeah. We had to trade our pick, so we could have CJ Stroud. Yeah. That would have been good. Yeah, that would have been really nice. I'm a huge Buckeyes fan. Yeah, me too. Four to win. Yeah? Oh, and my daughter actually goes to school there. Oh, really? Oh, nice. Yep. And my son goes to OU, so we actually are going to go to the Ohio State-Ohio University game in September. Oh, that'll be good. yeah very good yeah a lot of fun good family day i went to the branch of osu and limo when i was working so i tried to get a campus i tried to get as many colleges as i could big campus it's so funny we had it um like last year my son's older than her but we were moving him in and then on the way back we cut through columbus because she needed something dropped off to her and it was like so within like an hour and a half we're at two different campuses and it's just weird like it's totally different feel like I love Ohio State and stuff but it's like a city in a city oh you're so cute and quaint and it's pretty and it's just you feel safer very different my wife is from Westerville which is right in Columbus campus yeah yeah just turned 18 year old daughter I heard you know how I've stated it.
