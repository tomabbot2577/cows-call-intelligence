I'm just following up because we still have not had any payment on the invoices. So before we can consider anything, we need a payment made. There's really only been, I think, one in almost a year. So again, we don't let anybody go this long. So we desperately need to, I don't know how to use the word desperately, but we do need to have a payment made because the count is severely overdue. So let me know once you've made some payments on those invoices. Thank you.",
