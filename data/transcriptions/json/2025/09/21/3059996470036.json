    "text": " Good morning, this is Dave. Good morning, Dave. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Hey, Robin. I'm so sorry. We were in an internal meeting when you called. I checked your database and I'm not seeing any slowness. Are you still experiencing an issue? Let me try someone here. I'm bringing people in, LinkedIn replyers here. Let me try them real quick. So, go ahead, get him up there. So, it was capture or your database? Capture. Okay, because the database itself seems moving fine. It's pretty much, it was a little bit, the database was a little slower, but that's improved. But capture has been real slow. Okay. So, was it at the same time that the database was slow? same time and it's still going on or was I stopped waiting to hear back from you folks okay because I'm wondering if a database slowness was making the process of checking for duplicates and stuff like that to go slow too can you try a capture now and see if it's better since the database seems fine yeah let me get him out he's already up here okay click add I'm just going to go ahead and add him straight up without well I got to put some stuff in no I got to put or won't let me go forward Okay, there it goes. Normally it's finished by now, and it's still, there's three dots that sort of get big and get small. Okay, let me try to capture myself. There it went, finally. Okay. Let's see. Well, that would not be related to cash, so let me just try something here. Okay. So mine seemed fine. Connecting to my database. Can we do a screen share? Sure. Okay. Do you have RingCentral? No, I don't. I don't use it. Let me delete this one guy. I've only got one chance here. Okay. What do we need? I'm going to send you a Google Meet bear with me one second let me bring this up here and it's davidtodaysactuary.com that's the correct email yes okay Last time I came in and span our junk and I had to massage it so we could open it. Nothing yet. Have you said? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Might take a moment to get in. Who is your Internet provider? Well, now it's called a sound. Everything else is working. And I even restarted the computer to make sure it wasn't on, or at least not on my end. maybe got spam no spam no junk I've not received that Robin okay I'll send it again fuck Thank you. You still didn't get the email? No. That's really odd. What happened to 123? Wasn't that what you guys were using? I don't, yeah, I don't have that account. Okay. I think Sean was the only one that really used that I didn't do more tactical stuff, but it doesn't restrict you as much. No, it's not here. That's so strange. If I send it, I've got it in my clipboard still. Let me see. Dave at todaysactuary.com. Yes. And how do you receive your email? Like is it an Outlook or Gmail? Yes, Outlook. You could sure send me the bills. Yeah, I mean, I'm just... No, I mean, this should come right from me. I'm going to send you another. That is so strange. Let's see. There it is. But there's no link. So that was another email that I sent. Is it just like more like a test email? Okay. Yeah, here is another email. All right. So let's see. I'm going to send another one. I'm just going to send it with my link. Maybe it doesn't like my link in there. I made it safe last time you sent it because it ended up in junk. So I said always, you know, don't block this person. But still, she ended up in junk email. Okay, I'm going to send you another one. Okay, hit send receive now. Let's see if you get this other email that I tried to send you with a meeting link. Yeah. Okay. Okay, got it. Okay. Okay. I've got you up there in the center on my screen. okay all right so when I have you do you don't need to get joined with a computer audio so you can make sure that's muted we don't have any interference it is okay click share screen well it's on both screens I have LinkedIn on one side and okay so what you're going to want to do is when you click share screen go over to entire screen and then select which screen to share all right which one do you want to see um whatever has I guess the LinkedIn for now um worst case scenario we drag the other screen over we just have to kind of pick out yeah to start with okay so let's go over to LinkedIn which is your first tab gotcha okay and then let's say click to update oh she's already in there oh no that's this kid he I don't want him he didn't send me his email so we've got to do Christina okay okay where is she working let's see this career break oh she's on a career break I'm gonna use her anyway because that's all I've got I don't want her but uh we'll put it in career bank as a company. What I would do, go back, down at the very bottom. Okay. When you hit click to add, when you click directly on the company name, what it does is it puts a number. One means you're going to be updating the company with what it's pulling from the profile. If you just want to pick it, That way you're leaving the company in the database exactly as it is. If you hover on one of those career bank companies and just use the checkbox, what that means is you're just putting them into that company, but you're not going to be making any changes to it. So that might be better in this case. Okay, so let's hit review. So it didn't find her, but it found a company that we picked. Okay. and then go ahead and add any details I'm just using my actually don't use your own email on somebody because if you start if you have PCR mail it'll write everything that you send or receive in your PCR mail to this record you know kind of my favorite activities it might be better not to have the emails in the overview section because that way they're otherwise they're going to be required well i have to have my kid contact him without it where'd she go to school that doesn't matter because i'm not keeping her let's say ohio state i was just there yesterday were you moving my daughter in oh i'm tired today. Is she a freshman or? Sophomore. Nice. Okay now I can click, now I can submit. Everything's complete. Okay. Are you ready? Yep. Here we go. Now that should have been in there right now. I guess nobody else has called in complaining. We had like one, but then we went in and none of it seemed fine. So we're trying to figure out why, which is one of the reasons why I asked who your Internet service provider is. Yeah, it was... have a Spanish name before they switch to a sound. I think it's just Southwest. Like if you just go over to your PCR database, let's see what's going on over there. Okay. And if it's on your other tab or on your other monitor, just drag it on top of this LinkedIn screen. And that way I see it. Okay. let's have you just kind of move around and see if there's any slowness going on here let's go to like activities and then go up to position okay so that seems fine it's just that when I submit to the time it gets in there okay Let's do this. Can you click on manage extensions for me? Which is the kind of like puzzle piece looking icon. Okay, Adobe Grammarly. Should be fine. Okay. Can you go to the three vertical dots and crawl? In which? In PC? In Chrome. The three vertical dots up in Chrome. Yeah. Okay. Let's go down to, go to help. Let's see if it's up to your Chrome is even updated. Go to about Google Chrome. Let's see if this helps at all. Now we might get kicked out of the meeting. Just click the link to jump back in if it happens usually after you update it tries to relaunch I thought I was supposed to do this automatically Okay, hit relaunch. Okay, so left to meeting. So we'll have to have you join back in. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Share screen. Yes. Okay. Share screen. Yes. Okay, let's go back over to LinkedIn. I don't think I have any more replyers she should be in there already we just did what if you try adding me and we just see if it works okay so it's Robin robin and last name is Montoni mo n t o and i you're already in the database that's okay just want to see the captures okay There's no add. Do me a favor. At the very top left of my profile, there's the reload option. It's like the kind of recycling circle. Click that. Yeah, that does work sometimes. Okay, interesting. Let's go to manage extensions. Let's go to, let's go all the way down to manage extensions for a moment. Click update, I put the top left. I made this update. I just want to make sure. Grammarly has errors. that's interesting any of these extensions new I'm looking the ad block is on no I don't think I don't think so I am so is a screen recorder and screen capture I don't know what that is but I haven't I've had anything except yeah that's like basic you want to do like a like a video recording of your screen okay I just do snippets as technical as I get yeah that's doing like like like a like recording a video like if you want to show me an issue you could use loom to kind of record it I think yeah I ordered that I downloaded that years ago so okay yeah and it's off so that's probably not it either okay do you still have other LinkedIn tab open on your other screen that closed right yeah there's only one LinkedIn open okay let's try going to my page again let's try to renew it messaging yeah let's and let's try pushing messaging down for a second actually let's try reload first resolve click on a view full profile oh that's why because they were not really on the page yet. That could be why. Ah, okay. There we go. Yeah, we weren't really in the page. We were kind of like in a search results kind of mode, it looks like. Ah, okay. Okay, so let's try update now. Let's see if it does anything. A little slower than expected. Okay, I'll just look at my card. And then I'm currently in main sequence. So see where it says use Robin's company? Yes. Yeah, see where it says use Robin's company? Just slide that on. And that way it just keeps me in the company I'm in without making any changes. And then hit review. That was quick. Er. Okay. Let's see. Credentials. You got a couple fields there you're going to have to fill in for me. Since you haven't. Anything under overview. No. Anything under overview is required. Okay. That looks like we still have something missing under credential in school. Where did you go to school? Put Ohio State. And then credential. Yeah. And then just make up something. We can always take this off. I did. It didn't take it. Yeah. I think it wanted to create. Yeah. Just pick anything. Okay. oh it wants my it wants my library yeah so we're gonna make you an associate okay submit yeah try submit now boom that should have gone why is it taking longer than it should i'm trying to figure out why here when else could it be i mean we could try removing and then re-adding the capture the problem is you're gonna have to redo some of the customizations again if we do that That didn't take very long at all. Let's check those first, all the matches are captured. Yep, those should all be on. Those just control what sites will it actually work on. on. Okay. So we want to uninstall this and reinstall it. Yes. Well, we could, if it, if it, if it's slow, we could try that. But the only thing like some of those customizations that you did with your capture, such as what's under overview, you would have to redo that. I just want to give you a heads up on that. Oh no, I don't want to do that. Okay. Cause my daughter uses it too when she's working with me. So, yeah. Yeah, we would have to redo those configurations. They don't, like if you uninstall and reinstall it. And you've already tried restarting your computer, right? Yes. Okay. And cache would not have anything to do with it. Oh, you're going to 20 years with the company. Wow. Yeah. My daughter I just sent for a second year, I was pregnant with her when I started. Okay. Let me have you try this. Just go over to name, for example, in your database. Let's just try moving around in the database. Let's see if you have any slowness here at all. Just stuff you would kind of normally do. That all seems pretty fine. Yeah, it seems fine. I mean, we could wait the night and see if it straightens out. I don't have anybody else to add right now. Okay. Yeah, let me know, because we did have a customer whose database was slow. So I was thinking maybe it was related to that, but then your database seemed fine to me. Yeah. And it seems fine to you. So it's kind of just trying to figure out what's really slow. Yeah, I'll have more inputs tomorrow. Okay. And I'll give them a try. Yeah, let me know if it gets better. I will. I'll make a note. Or if you're still having an issue. Okay. All right. So I'm going to change the ticket. that it created when you left your voice moment is sign that over to your name and then i'll reply in there and then that way all you have to do is just reply in that email um and it will alert me and then we have everything tracked together sound good yes uh one last question is ohio state going to beat texas i'm sure hoping well i'm from ohio so I'm an Ohio State guy, too. Oh, I'm sure hoping. That's going to be the big test, right? That's it. That's a good one. I'll give you an email in the morning. I'll let you know where we stand with this thing. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. Thanks, Robin. Bye now. Bye. Bye.",
