    "text": " welcome to zoom enter your hey guys no yelling I'm going on a call enter your participant ID followed by pass you are in the meeting now there is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, this is Jim. Hey Jim, Eric here. Hey Eric, how are you? Good, there's Matt. Hello. Hello, Matt, how are you? Good. Jim, how are you? I'm well, I'm well. Do you have a camera, Jim, or are you just calling in? Oh, no, I have a camera. I just always keep it off. Well, we're in the people business. We like to see faces. That's no worries. Pop it on right there. I just keep it off. There you go, real person. But not a demo today, so I don't have to keep it off for sure. Thank you, Jim, for doing that. No problem. We actually like seeing who we're talking with. Okay, so I think that's everybody. We don't have anybody else joining us, Jim. So, Jim, we – Eric, did you already update Jim as to what we're doing? Yeah, we had a conversation a couple weeks back, two, three weeks ago, I think, when it first came out, what we were trying to accomplish. So I had reached out to Jim early on just to at least get the ideas rolling. Okay, cool. So, Jim, you understand. Maybe you tell me what you understand, and then we can go from there. I think, as I recall, it was spinning off a new division, a new and separate division of TIGES still kind of under the umbrella, but a different division. I don't know if that's physical location or what or how many people were going or what. So I know the basics, I recall, when we spoke. Yes. So we're taking basically we've had different groups and we had a group or like an entity called Tigus Elite. And we're going to spend that under a new name. And that part that physically is here in Florida. And basically it's all the same people log in. Still have a different email, though. So you'll have to know that. But it's all the same people. It's going to run on the same MSP, but under a different way. We'll have access to it through the web. But we're basically just a group, the same group. But it's going to be a spinoff, a separate entity, if you were to call it that. So with that entity, then it would be billed separate, though. We want to keep the costs separate. So it wouldn't be billed to Eric anymore. It would be billed to what's called index search group. An index search group has will be able to process it. And I can be the responsible person for that at the moment. Cool. OK, so really what we're looking for is just the same tool and process we have today. You know, we use PC recruiter every day. It's not. and we have the same people that are logged in every day. We just log in under a different email and entity, and we would pay you from a slightly different entity or a different entity as well. Okay. And so what we're looking for is just how do we make that work without keeping two different emails and everything else? Perfect, perfect. And so my first question, so the primary URL you have right now is the Titus International. Is this going to remain a separate database under that URL, or were you looking to have a new URL created, totally separate URL account, et cetera? Or have you even thought that far? Yes, it's the latter. It will be a separate. We have a domain and everything up, and I can send you that, Jim. Perfect. It'll be indexsearch.com, everything like that. The email, my email will switch. Victoria, who runs our operations, She runs all the recruiters. She's listening, and she will be the one that has the team that reports into her. So she's listening to see how it might impact her group. For sure. For sure. Perfect. So what we'll need to do is we will need to have that whole new account created with the new URL and everything like that. Probably, since we'll need a main contact, we'll probably want to do a whole new contract under that new name to get a new signer, new payer, everything like that. almost run it like it's a brand new company in general uh there okay um so we'll need who would be the the contract signer on the new organization would that be you matt i i will be yeah it's you can send it to because jim we don't have the email set up yet so you just send it to matt.deon and then at tygus.com perfect okay i will do that and then say different company names So the company is going to be Index Search Group. Same address, the 5247 Discovery Park? Oh, no, we're in the Florida location. Oh, okay. So I can send that to you, but it's 820 A1A North. I can send it to you, Jim. Okay. You'll send me an email. I'll get you all the information you need. Perfect, yes. So I'll need that proper company name, the address. I'll send it to you. And then we'll do the same pricing, same package. How many users? It looks like we have you at 27 now in TIGES. How many of those are going to leave TIGES and move over to index? It's almost a split in half. I think it's going to end up being 13 users, and then I think we're keeping the remainder, the 14. And I can get an update also. I'll send you the update on that. Eric, I'll leave one for the IT specialist, too. He's going to manage the database down here. So we'll get him a seat, too, Jim. But Eric and I, we'll send you whatever. Yeah, you send me. We can make it 14 or whatever. And then, Eric, let me know how many we would need to drop off of the main Tygis account, too, once we're done so we don't double bill or over bill or anything like that. Yep. So they'll get a – and we plan on copying the whole data. and at least initially give them a full copy of our default database. Jim, that'll be there because we still have the three databases there. So they'll get a full copy of the default. And really the question I would have is, is there anything when you do a copy that doesn't copy over well or that is anything lost in transition? or like, for example, I think about when they create a new job order, do they have to reset the counter as for the job order number creation or do we set that? So those kinds of little details so that they're starting off on the same foot. Sure, sure. I'll have to check on some of the specifics. I know when we move the database, all the data is going to go. Usernames, passwords, that's going to remain the same. Everything is going to stay the same. I think everything should go over, but I'll talk to my guys, see if there's anything to know. Okay. And every existing roll-up, Jim, that we have in place, you know, things like that, because we have active search. We're just trying not to create any kind of, right, we don't want to create any disruptions for our client or, you know, in the search process. So we have active projects. That's really the important part. Yeah. Most likely, when we've done this in the past, you normally set like a cut-off date, Matt, and you say, hey, guys, everyone have a system this date, copy it over, over. I think, Jim, I think you guys have done it when we've done them in the past, like over, I don't know, a Friday night over the weekend and make sure it's up running by first thing next week or maybe you've done this two or three other times. Yeah, usually we'll pick a date. That way we make sure all of your team is out, nobody's entering, changing, anything like that, so it'll be exactly as it were, that agreed upon time. You know, we know, and everybody knows. One other question. Oh, I saw an email about a data return. Has that been underway or has anything happened with that yet? Or maybe I'm – because I thought I saw something going back and forth. Let me see. Copy database. Okay, no, it was just letting me know that that was going to happen. It wasn't the – I didn't know if it was the actual copy database request was in yet. but it's not. That's good. So we'll get the agreements in place. We'll want to have the new URL created once we have everything signed, get the new payer on, new user counts. Once that's done, then we can go ahead. I think we'll probably need a sign off from you, Eric, as the current signer, just so you are signing off to authorizing us to move the database, to take the copy and move it over. So we'll need that. And then that'll be a ticket after we get the contracts in place and everything. Gotcha. How long? Go ahead. No, Eric, you go. I was going to say, also, Jim, if you'll check with them, again, one of the things we may want to verify is we are a RingCentral user also, is if we do have to reset up or if they'll end up having to reset up the RingCentral click-to-dial credentials, authorization, that kind of stuff, that's what I'd want to be sure that at least we're prepared. Again, it's simple. It's an easy setup. But I just want to be sure that that kind of stuff, we have that taken care of. Yeah. I'll ask her on. I don't know if that will need to be reset up, but I'll ask my tech support team. And they'll be available if there is a need to reset that up. Yeah. Got it. Jim, what do you think the timing is? How long do you think this takes? Or is it like I can sign everything by tomorrow, you know, whatever it is. I can probably get you. Or let's just say by Friday of this week. Yeah. Do you have any estimate? Probably we could even arrange maybe this Friday, it being only Tuesday. As soon as I get the information from you, I can email the paperwork. It'll go through like that DocuSign. You can sign it. Once we sign it, we'll get a new credit card on file. We'll have the proper user number. It takes a day or so to have the new URL created. So that should be ready to be done by Friday. And then once we have the sign-off, I can get the ticket in queue as long as my tech support team can make that time work. This Friday at latest, maybe next Friday or some evening next week. Yeah. We'll probably push it out a week because we don't have our new emails yet to be able to put that in. So we definitely have to have that in place. So, yeah, we can get everything else done commercially, whatever we need to do. And then you put the ticket and then we'll just work on a date that works for everybody, for your team and for us. I don't see it happening this Friday for us. Yeah, I don't see the transfer happening this Friday, but it'll be it could be next week. It could work. Yeah, and we can coordinate that between the tech support team as we go. So that's no problem. Okay. Anything we're missing? Anything else? I don't think so. Just as soon as I get everything from you, company name, address, user account, I'll email that, then sign it. We'll get the payment arrangement set up, get the link set up. Then we'll be ready to get the ticket in, get the sign-offs, and get it scheduled up. so Vic you'll need to figure out what day what day you want to do your team will have to just be out of it and Jim we just assume a full day right or it could be three hours but we just would assume a day yeah I would say just some evening maybe if you can hop out a little early one evening if it's a Friday if it's Tuesday whatever it might be then my guys can pre-schedule that time to go and take the backup make it available over on the new URL you'll also want to make sure anybody that's going to be using a new URL knows after X date, don't log in under the Titus one, do log in under the Index one. So we want to make sure they know when they need to move. Yeah. And we can even disable logins at that point, you know, make sure they close all active windows. If somebody's using a home PC or something like that, make sure they close those out. Yeah. No, that would be, they always want to go home early. That's never a problem. Yes. It shouldn't be a fight. That'll be easy, Jim. Not a problem. Not a problem then. Okay, great. It seems like you've done this a few times, Jim, so it's not new. But yeah, do you want to send me a list of things you need or do you want me to just start with what I know, like the URL or you want to send me a list? All I really need is the company name, the street address, how many users, and even if you have a preference on what you might like the URL to be, whether you want it to be odbc.index or odbc.index search group, whatever it might be, and then my guys will try and make it that. And that's all I need, so I don't need a whole bunch of info. Okay. All right. Perfect. That sounds good. All right. We'll get it together. I'm going to save you some time. Eric, can you stay on? And Jim, thank you so much. Very well. I'll send you an email. Okay. Thank you. thank you both alright thanks take care bye bye Eric should we so this is yeah I don't want to I just oh if you leave you may drop us if I leave if I leave I end it so that's why I'm trying to figure out if I can leave I'll call you right back we'll leave we'll leave okay alright I didn't want to kill it on you there alrighty take care bye bye goodbye",
