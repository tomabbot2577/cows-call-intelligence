    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah, hi, Tyler. So I have most of my roll-ups based on people's names, and then obviously they've got the company. I want to extract a list of just companies from a roll-up without having to individually copy and paste each name. So if I'm on a name roll-up list that's got, let's say, 80 names on it, but out of those 80 names, there's probably only like 30 companies, how do I extract those companies into or to a place where I can just view the companies, copy and paste them, email them out, stuff like that, if I'm doing a report? it. So what you can do, what's your username for the database so I can pull you up here? It's EssexFinal, username is msikerka, s-i-e-k-i-e-r-k-a. One second to get logged in here. So what we can do is an advanced company search. Okay. And say like, hey, we only want the companies that are associated with the names on this roll-up. Okay. And then add those company names to a rollup and then export the company rollup. All right. So how do I do that? So what we're going to do first is go to Companies up at the top. Yep. Go to Advanced where we see under that basic search. Got it. Where we see where it says Predefined Fields. We're going to go into there and scroll down to where it says Name Rollup. Got it. and it will leave that on list, and then we'll click that little pop-out at the very end. Okay, and then pick the rollout. Yep. Okay, and then hit add, I guess? So it'll automatically add once it's below that line, and then you'll just hit that little magnifying glass to search. Okay, got it. And then once you have your search results, You can do the select all results. Select all results, okay. And then click that little book icon to roll up the companies. And then create a new roll-up? Or you could even just add them to that same roll-up, but on the company side. Got it, got it, got it, got it. Okay, so get trade. And then it'll go to companies. It's 37 companies. Okay, cool. So now you can click roll-ups up at the top. Go to that roll-up. Go to companies, NF37. Sort by company name. Okay, now click all results. Yep. Okay. And then you can go into that same dropdown that you would to export a name roll-up. You'll see that export option in the company roll-up as well. And what do I export it to? I've never done this before, so what do I export it to? You could just do like a CSV, because that'll give you just a list of the company names. Is that what you needed, was just a list of the company names? Okay, so I clicked on that, and then what? You should see it in your downloads folder coming up. If you do export and then CSV. Okay, there we go. Go to downloads. It went to an Excel. And then I got all the companies in Excel. Okay. Very good. All right, cool, man. I appreciate it. Thank you. Yep, not a problem. All right, take care. Thank you.",
