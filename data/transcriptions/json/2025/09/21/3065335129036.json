    "text": " This is Melanie. Hi, Melanie. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Oh, hi. It's at Onyx Carnona. Oh, yeah. That's a former employee. Yeah, it's another. Okay. Yeah, you might have just had that number. In my phone. Yeah, you might have just had the main number. Yeah. Do we have many? Is that what the deal is? Yeah. Now, here's the thing. So I might want to adjust that for you. So we had a billing system. We've changed billing systems, and we've been sending the invoices to Melanie underscore Kirk. Mm-mm. No? Okay. Okay, so is it the end Kirk? Okay, let me fix that for you now. Okay, let me fix that. The other thing was is I got this note that said, I think it was in the mail, and it's something about people were trying to get your receivables or something yeah that's real longer it was kind of it yeah we've resolved that now what I'm going to do here though I'm going to take off because a couple late fees were added so I'm just going to clean that up for you hold on one second So that's going to adjust this total. This one only. Okay. Fix that one. And then there's one other one where there is a late fee. Yeah, so we haven't received payment in five months. Okay. So it's about $150. I can't remember the rate. So let me see. I'm going to give you a new total because the new system applies late fees after 30 days. So the total owed is $365.05. My goodness. Yeah. So it's five months of $73.01. Do you want to give me the card over the phone and then I can set it up for auto pay for you? Well, I don't want to pay that balance for it today because I don't have it. Okay. So what we can do is we can pay on my next payday, but let's not get behind. Make sure you're sending me those invoices to the correct email address. Yeah, I've got that fixed for you. Is there anything that you could pay today so that we can get it turned on? I could pay about $150. Okay. Why don't we do that? Okay, so let me go over here. I think we have an Apple. Let's call it. Is that where I am? No, no, no. No, no. Let's go to PayPal. Let me open up. Empyrean. Okay. And please send it to our address. Yes. I've got that all fixed. I have the late fees off now. Okay. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take. Okay. All right. I'm going to add your name in here. Hold on one second. I'm going to clean things up a little bit. I'm going to add your name. Oh, darn it. How did I do that? Okay, so they gave me this virtual debit card because my other card had fraud on it. And so I see the last four digits on it. I could pay you for PayPal. Do you have PayPal at all? I don't think we have PayPal on this. there's a credit card on here I just add your PayPal debit card to your favorite stores because I don't have the physical card with me because oh that's my problem I'm going because I can pay you right now I would just have to let me see what add bank cards add store cards add cash card let me go to this and see if I can get a routing yeah this this one is it's a it's a asking for a card number you're right i understand what you're saying you understand what i'm saying yeah i can't yeah i need like the full number of the expiration okay yeah get the most out of your card activity okay man if i wish i just had my freaking card. Apple wallet. Let's go here. Okay, it's active. And then I request a physical card. Oh, damn it. Okay. Oh, you're all set up. No, I'm not because I can't see it. Yeah, usually they kind of mask everything for security. I mean, I understand that, but when you're trying to get to it and own the card and own the money, it doesn't help, you know? I'm the one who owns the money. Yeah. Don't know what to do. So y'all don't have a bank account I could transfer to? We could do ACH. I could send the information over to you. that. Hold on just a second. I think they'll do that. Add money, transfer. I'm sorry. Normally, I have a regular card and I'm struggling. Transfer to a bank. Transfer to PayPal. I don't feel comfortable doing that because it'll add your banking information there forever. Unless you're already pre-set up on PayPal. So, So, yeah, we don't... We can try to do it. Let me try to call them and call you back. Is this the best number to reach on? Yeah, let me give you my number and extension. And I'm going to go ahead and send you our ACH information in case you want to do that. Okay. If you do do it that way, just if you can reach out to me, just let me know so I can have our bookkeeper check the bank account. I'll try to have it handled by the end of the day. Okay. My number is 440-946-9000. 5214 and I'm at extension 5466. Hold on, my pen's not writing. 5 2, come on. Let me get another pen out. It's two pens that aren't writing. It happens though, when you're this busy you know, things happen. Okay, 5214, there we go. yeah and I sent you an email too what's your extension 5 4 6 6 and I sent you an email with our ACH information okay information also in there and then I also just sent you a statement to the new email address but that one will come from billing at main sequence and won't have my gotcha okay gotcha okay just let me know I will try to get this done. I'll call them and see what I need to do to get that part done. Because I'm sure that they can walk me through what to do. It's probably user error. So, okay. And just make sure to always send it to the correct email address. Yep, I've got that updated. And honestly, I think probably if I didn't update stuff, it would become that note I got that was so weird. it was bad timing on things yeah it didn't help yeah I agree because who you know who's who is what I kept thinking right I'm going to be paying the wrong person that didn't deserve to be paid so okay alright well we're good to go let me call them and I'll call you back Okay, sounds good. All right. Thank you. And what is your name again? Robin Montoni. Is it R-O-B-I-N or Y-N? I-N. I-N. And I don't see the email from you. I see the email from Main Sequence. Yeah, you should have got one from me as well, from Robin Montoni. And it'll have Main Sequence updated ACH in the subject line. I got my junk. And you're sending it to MCurk now. Yeah, MCurk at ENPX.com. Let me just go to my email box and put in my name. Your email has Robin in it. Oh, there we go. Action required. Add your contact. Create new contact. Done. Okay. and you'll need to click sign up the first time you create the account. Please note that the portal is for billing. If you have any questions. Okay. So I can do that for you, but it'd probably be better if I do it for you only because you're not paying the full balance. Okay. Okay. So when you have the card details or if you choose to do the ACH, just let me know. And then as long as I get the 150 today, I'll activate it today. Okay. All right. Sounds good, Robin. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. All right. Thanks. Bye.",
