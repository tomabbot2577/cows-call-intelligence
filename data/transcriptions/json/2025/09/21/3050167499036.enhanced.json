I am having trouble logging into my PCR capture. Yeah. So is it giving you like a password error or? Yeah. So it says, so the first thing it says is log in, which is just the PCR URL, correct? Correct. Your unique one. Right. So do I need to – that's the URL after I log in, correct? The one on your login page. Right. Okay. So let me – Yeah, you'll paste it in that box up top and then hit log in. Okay. And it's asking me for my username and password, which is my PCR username and password, correct? Correct. then you'll need to select your database from the drop-down that's probably why it didn't work okay so now okay so just All right, so I'm all logged in. Go to PCR capture. And all right, so I'm on the candidate on LinkedIn, and I get the pop-up that says capture. And then to the right it says match. So it should be, so I click on capture. So you'll see where it says, like, click to add over on the side. You don't click the actual extension up in the top. you'll see a click to add when you're on a full profile over on the right-hand side. Yeah, that's what I'm not – that's what I was looking for. I'm not seeing that. Go ahead and refresh the tab that you're on. Oh, there it is. Okay, that's what I was looking for. Got it. All right, so let me just – got it all right awesome yep that was looking awesome all right thanks so much for y'all not a problem have a great day bye",
