    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, this is Garrett. Hey. Someone on the line named Nicole Figliano with Job.com wanted to ask about funds that she said that left the bank, but they're still going. Oh, can you have her? Oh, let me see. That's Job.com. Hold on one second. Oh, theirs is a mess. that left the bank, but they're still... There's stuff I can't really do anything with it. Can you... I'll talk to her. That's not on you. Sorry, but go ahead. No, yeah, no worries. I'll send her. Okay, let me send her over. Here we go. Thank you for holding. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Nicole, and I'm calling in regards to our account. Yes. We received two invoices yesterday that were paid. Okay. And we show that the funds were released from our bank. Okay. And I wanted to get this verified with you. So I, because you guys are doing things like ACH or something, right? Well, we're trying. We want our account to go ACH. Okay. Yeah. I think. I think on your portal, like using your portal ACH. Okay. So that one, which two were they? This was the... The 15 and the 416? Yeah. Yeah, the 15 and the 416, the 2202622, and then the... Oh, okay. Yeah, we do have... 2202621. We do have... I want to check it here because we do have the July ones paid, but the June ones were open. These are the ones that we paid. I think that they might have been misapplied on your own then. You paid the June, but not the July? When is July due? This week? They're like due upon receipt. so they're kind of but those are the ones that those are the two that she marked as that are showing as paid the two June ones are the ones that are open okay no it should have been the two June ones marked paid okay so yeah the way she's doing yours um okay let's see um okay yeah then I do have two four seven nine yeah in my system okay yeah the seven nine ones are paid do you have the six nines or no I have the six nines but we're showing those as paid so when were those paid? Those were paid on last week I think or finally got them to go through Okay so that would be these two July payments that were applied to the July invoices so is the problem just that they were applied to the wrong invoices? Yeah they were misapplied those payments applied to the yeah Okay so let me job matcher okay so I have to get email I think you guys you've been messaging back and forth with Kathy um she's handling kind of that because with uh since it hasn't been going through she's been doing it a different way for you guys um let me see just took a call from Nicole the 2 July payments and that was the $1,500 and $1,467 should have been applied to the June invoices, right? Yes. Leaving the July invoices open. And now if she could send those to me with the ACH instead of credit card payment, I could go ahead and pay those too. Okay, so can you fix the invoice applied to I'm gonna have her do this because she's more filled at HGH stuff then send an ACH link to pay July all right I'm gonna get this over to her and I'm going to copy you on this okay let's see this Nicole that fig Leanna with job.com correct yes okay okay let's see I'm I'm going to do this one. Let me see. All right. So I'm going to send this over to her. And you are copied on it. Okay. And I just want to have her do those changes. Okay, yeah, because I'm the billing amateur. She's the billing expert. Okay, so yeah, because we were like, wow, what is going on? Why can't we just do it this way? And I know that it's a systems type workaround thing, I guess, you know, on your end, because you probably have all people that pay credit cards. And we just don't have that available capability on our end. Yeah. I think switching to the new system it was not really realized that that person was going to be an issue so we're kind of working we're kind of working through it for other things it's been incredible like people able to you know maintain their car get these reminders instead of all the going manually this part with the ACH has been a little bit more of a struggle so okay so that's why I'm having her work out those parts because that's not stuff I'm really that familiar with, but she will get that handled for you. Awesome. Well, thank you so much. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. And if you don't hear back, I don't know. I will say, I don't know if you guys ever talked to Jared that worked with us. He passed away. So we're going to be, pretty much everyone else, we're going to be out for, I mean, Kathy doesn't really work for us. She's like a consultant. but if she doesn't get back to you maybe like in the next 24 hours you know you can follow up with me or just reply back to that email and I'll make sure it gets handled but I just you know this afternoon I know I will be out so okay all right okay well thank you so much oh you are welcome thank you thank you bye",
