    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I, yesterday I got an email that there are new AI-powered features that PCR has introduced for content creation and database search, right? Enhanced database search. Yes, yeah, we have a trial going on. The only one that's not already enabled in the database is the search, just because back-end upgrade is required for that, and not every database has that search index yet. What company are you with? So I can pull you up here. Okay, I am with Maxwell Management Group. All right. Let me just pop in. And then what was your name so I could get you pulled up here? Heather Maxway. Okay, so your database would need that upgrade. So all you would have to do is send an email to support at main sequence dot net and request an upgrade to Lucene. Just a second. Can you please repeat the email ID? It is support at? Support at main sequence.net. Okay. And request the upgrade to Lucene in order to activate the AI search trial. The upgrade to Lucene? Yep. Can you spell that for me, please? Yeah, Lucene is L-U-C-E-N-E. I believe. Let me just double check that. Yep. L-U-C-E-N-E. Okay. And then is there like a difference of the pricing for the account? No. For the Lucene, normally this Lucene upgrade, there would be a cost, but as part of this AI search trial, it's free right now to upgrade to Lucene. Okay. So, are neither of the two working, like the content creation and database search? Are they both in trial phase right now? Yeah, so the other, like the content creation parts are active in the database. That trial already started. Those things are already in there. Oh, okay. Okay. And in order to upgrade to Lucene, we have to just put an email and request for an upgrade. And right now, that will be for free. Once you start charging, may I know just like what the difference will be? That I'm not sure. You would have to ask your account representative that. Which is Jim Lombardo. Do you have his contact information? No. Can I guess that? Yeah. You can always just email him. His email is jim at main sequence dot net. Mm hmm. Just a second. Jim is J. I am right. Yep. And then his extension. So it's the same phone number you called for the support line, like our main office number. but his extension is 5401. Okay. Okay. And then I'm not very sure if you should be, if I should be asking you this, but if I need to know how the content creation part of the AI feature that you're providing works, will you, can you show me that or should I ask Jim? So we have, the information for available in our learning center. Okay. So if you go to learning.pcrecruiter.net. Yeah. I am there. And then PC Recruiter 9. Okay. Latest PC R9 updates. That's right. Yep, so you'll go to the new updates and features and then AI features will be listed on there. Just a second, let me see my new updates and features. Is it written again? What was that? I'm asking that is it written? You keep cutting in and out there. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Yes. I'm asking, where does it say new updates? Like, I can't see it. I don't seem to find it. Yeah, when you click on where it says PC Recruiter 9. Yeah. And then that first one that says new updates and features, once you click on PC Recruiter 9. Give me a second. You might have to scroll down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see it now. Yep, and then you'll see over on the right it says AI features new. You'll click on that and then click on AI features. And then there's a little video in there, and then just little walkthroughs for the other parts as well. AI features new, AI features, and then there should be a video. Oh, I see the video. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Yep, not a problem. And then just when you send in that request, just make sure you're sending it from Heather's email ID. Yep. Yeah, of course. So because she'll, in order for the Lucene upgrade, it has to come from the contract signer. Right, exactly. Yes. So, but, yep, that'll be all you need to get that process started. Great, thank you so much for your time Have a good day Bye",
