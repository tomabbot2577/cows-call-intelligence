    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Dan O'Connor. I'm trying to log in to PCR, and my MacBook Pro is not bringing up the login credentials section. Okay. We'll just have you clear cache. Are you using Google Chrome? Safari. Oh, Safari. Okay. Let me look up on Google. Actually, no, it is Google Chrome, the browser I'm using on this particular thing. So it is Chrome. Okay. Click the three dots at the top right of the browser and go to more tools towards the bottom and then developer tools. That's done. All right. That will open up something like coding and stuff. You could just ignore that pop-up, leave it aside. and then right click on the refresh button that's to the left of your web address and you should see an option that says empty cache and hard reload mmm it says reload this page hold to see more options okay so hold to see more options empty cache and hard reload so hit that perfect yeah click on that and And that'll slowly reload the login page. And hopefully that's all it needed. OK. And what is that doing? It's just clearing stored up cache on the stored up data memory on the browser about this web page. And it's clearing it out so that it can get fresh information from this page. OK. So that completed its process. So now what should I do? X out of that? Yeah, you can X out of that. Are you seeing the database drop down or your username and password area? Reloading it. Okay. No, it's still not populating. Okay. Let me get on a screen share then. We'll take a look. go to a new tab in your browser go to meetings.ringcentral.com okay what's the meeting id a personal link name all right sorry uh this is taking a long time to load this meeting Yeah, you cut out there. Sorry, say that again. Say the meeting ID. I'm here. Okay. Yeah, one second. Okay, here's the meeting ID. It is 149729813. Join. Join. Perfect. All right, and if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since you're already on the phone. And then go ahead and hit the blue share button down at the bottom, select your entire screen up at the top. Mac OS requires access approval for screen sharing. Got it. Allow. Entire screen. Share. Okay, it's loading. Yes, I can see that. All right, go ahead and open up your new tab there. Perfect. Perfect. Okay, yeah, just choose your database from that drop-down. It doesn't show. The database at the – Oh. Oh, I see. That may be what I was doing. Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah. And check open PCR URL. You can even say always allow on that pop-up if it appears again. And then, yeah, you should be good. Awesome. Anything else you've been having trouble with? Nope. I think that's fine. Thank you. Appreciate you. Yeah. No problem. There is one more thing. I tried to get into PCR. I tried to get into PCR help earlier online, and I had a hard time doing it. Let's get me figured out on that. Oh, okay. Screen share. Okay. Sure. If you – yeah, you could go back to PC Recruiter tab that you have open, and there should be a – it's like the gear icon at the top right by your profile picture. far right. There's like a circle with a profile picture and then a gear. Yeah, click on that and then go to support. That'll take you right to the ticketing help area. What's my email address on file with you guys from Ted Nelson Associates or Heavy Industry Recruiting? Let's see here. d o'connor at heavy industry recruiting.com is one that we have but um that's my my email like and what's the password can i reset the password you can definitely reset it down at the bottom yeah Yeah, it sent like a password reset to your email address, so you'll have to check that email to get the password reset. And it might be in the spam. Hang on, I've got to forward this. Okay. Okay. Okay. Nothing yet, okay. Make sure I did it right. Because it seems glitchy there. Forget your password. Reset my password. Yeah, and when you click that, it'll tell you in green at the top. No. Nope. Yeah, I would continue to check your spam as well because it might not go right to your inbox. Okay, nothing yet. Let's see here. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and check my spam. Okay, nothing yet. Let's see here. Are there any other options? No, okay. It should be sending. I mean, that is the correct set of steps to get your password reset. B. O'Connor at heavyindustryrecruiting.com. Yeah, that's fine. I have another email that I might have used with you guys. Let's see if it works any better. Okay. It does take a few minutes to send usually. I'll follow that process. I'm sure that will get me in. I don't feel like that's worth screen sharing for. Okay, yeah. If you still have trouble, just let us know and we'll find a different way to get you into that support area. I think it's the first time. I'm just trying to get into it. Yeah, that makes sense. And if you do have questions that you want to send to us, you can always just email support at main sequence dot net and that'll create a ticket just like it would if you were logged into the help area.
