    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. How are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm okay. So I'm just having a little issue of logging into your guys' app right now so I can clock in for work. Who are you a contractor? Like, is it just like spinning or? so let me go to the actual app and tell you exactly what it's saying so I put in my login information it says my account is not found or available at this time please contact technical support and yeah I was the website to go to and I sent this to my boss and she told me to go on your guys website and contact you so for the What you probably need to do is contact the contractor, like whoever sent you the app invite previously, and have them resend it to you and redo the app. Like if it's saying your app is not found. So do you recommend to delete the app and redownload it as well? yes but download it in the way that it shows you in the email like how you download the app without opening it first and then hit the register okay alright thank you so much yep not a problem have a good one",
