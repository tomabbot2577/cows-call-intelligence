    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. What information do you need to open me up? I'm Connie Rose with Connected Services is what I'm on. Yep. I got you pulled up right here. How can I help you today? Well, it turns out I like my signature to have a little picture, right? Because a lot of people in my area know me. But when the email goes with my picture, it is ginormous. The picture is ginormous. And I didn't know that until today. And I thought, how can I get in there and change the size of the picture? Kevin brought it to my attention, and I didn't even know it. Because, like, when I send it, you know, I don't really go back and look at a sent box. them. Then, which database are you sending the email from? Well, let me think where he would have sent it from. I hope he's not talking about Gmail because that what it means to be with you. And he said call PCR, so it's got to be inside PCR. Figure out, because I'm new to this software, so that's fine. Let me go there. Here we go. The photo I've uploaded on my profile, I'm looking at it right now. So maybe when I send emails out, it looks smaller. So when the email signature that's attached to things that you send from PC Recruiter is if you go to system, email setup, and then email signature. Okay. Now I'm clicking on the little gear, thinking system might be in here, but I don't see system there. Up at the very top, you'll see like name, company, schedule. And then system will be up. I'm at the wrong gear. I'm at the wrong gear. I'm sorry. Okay. Email setup? Yep, and then email signature. Okay. Which it doesn't look like you have one. There's a signature in here. He must have not been talking about PCR. That's so weird. Now, are you in the Connective Services database or in the FinTech database? Naked services as far as I know. That's what it says up in the browser bar. Yep. But I probably, let me, I'm going to do this. I'm going to go ahead and put a picture in here because there's a lot of recruiters come at these companies, right? And in my market, I'm known and they know the name, right? but they associate the name with my old company name. And so I'm just trying to give a little brand awareness, so to speak. So while I'm in here, I'm going to go in here, and I'm going to try to insert an image from a file, choose a file. Let's see what happens because I've been wanting to do this. So while I'm calling you and while I got you on the phone, I'm going to try to do this. Headshot revised. make certain. He must be talking about Gmail. Bet you money that's what he's talking about. Yep. Yeah, because that's the only signature. You don't have one. Right. Let's try to fit this one in here. Let's hit okay. Oh, it's really big. Yeah, you can at least resize it in there. yeah you'll see like the little yeah like squares where you can get it down it really won't okay now just make sure you hit save yep yeah yeah I've learned that one the hard way I did it again today with a client I had put information. I thought I had done it. I thought I had lost it. Then I opened the file back up and I said, oh, thank God it's saved. I saved it. It's a little, you know, I know I should save things, but if you're not familiar with the software, certain things just don't jump out at you because it's a tiny little, tiny little, you know, circle with a floppy disk in it. And if you're not used to working in the software, you don't really see it. Anyhow, thank you very much. I'm going to go over to Gmail and see if he's talking about that one. Yep, not a problem. Have a great day. Okay, thank you, sir. Bye-bye.",
