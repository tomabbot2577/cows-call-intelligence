    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I've been communicating with Tyler online. He sent me some information like Java and I guess a loader, they called it, whatever it was. Oh, yeah. Java and PCR launcher. Yep. Yeah. So I installed that, and I still have a problem. So I wanted to try and see if I could rectify it as soon as possible, that's all. Sure, yeah, let's take a look. What's the issue that you're seeing? So I'm switching from one computer to another one. I'm going from Windows 10 to Windows 11, right? And I'm not having any problems on my Windows 10 computer. but on Windows, when I'm in Windows 11 and I'm in my email, if I click on an email and I go to, say, delete it, let's just say, let me just go in here and let me just tell you what happens. I click on it and nothing happens. And I cleared my, I cleared my cache and all that, but still nothing happens. And then also when I hit reply, a very tiny window opens up. You can't even see anything. It's not even a window. Okay, yeah. That usually happens if we push out like a small update on our software. Some computers do need cache cleared for that to appear correctly. But I can walk you through a specific way of clearing the cache that will probably help this. So if you have PCR open, Just click the three dots at the top right of the browser. Yep, done. And then go to more tools towards the bottom. Oh, okay. And then developer tools. So more tools to developer tools. Okay. And that'll open up some, you know, coding and stuff. You could just ignore that, leave it off to the side. and then up by your web address, www. To the left of that, there is a refresh button. Right-click on the refresh button. Okay. It says normal, reload, hard reload, empty cache. Oh, perfect. Hit the third option, empty cache and hard reload. Okay. And that will slowly refresh the page, and you can actually close those developer tools now. and we should be able to delete an email now or at least hit reply with normal looking. Okay, great. All right, that's working now, and then the other one was deleting an email. Let me see if I can do that. So, do I have to do that every once in a while? Is that? If you do notice strange issues with the display, it must mean that we've just pushed a small update. So, yeah, that does happen on some computers for some reason. Can you send me that in an email just so I have those instructions not to bother you the next time that happens? Oh, yeah, absolutely. Let me, let's see. What's your best email address? It's slumas at mcasearch.com. Perfect. Okay. I will. Yeah, I just found you here. Excellent. So, yeah, let me send you those instructions to clear cache and that way anytime that happens again you'll know yeah and then one more question this has nothing to do sure but I figure maybe you know so you know you are the doing the on-screen keyboard oh I haven't actually used that oh cuz cuz on my Windows 10 it has a little microphone so I could actually pull up the on-screen keyboard and then I could tap on the microphone and I can speak and it says where to go. But I can't do it on Windows 11. I don't know what happened to the little microphone thing. Oh, okay. On your newer computer, do you have a microphone built into it, installed on it? Well, yeah, because, yes, I do. It has a microphone. If I'm in Google, it has a microphone there and I could tap on it and I could speak. I don't know why it's not turning up on this other thing. It's just weird. That is strange. I didn't know you could do that speak-to-text kind of thing on the on-screen. Yeah, you can, but that's okay. If you're not used to using that, I'll try and figure it out. I'll YouTube it or something. As long as now this is working, that's great. I can deal with it now. So, all right. Yeah, I'm sending you that email now and definitely reach out if you have any other questions. Thank you. You have a nice day. You too. Bye.",
