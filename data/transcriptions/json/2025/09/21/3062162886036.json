See if you had any questions on that or anything that's going on. Nope, nope. I'm going to sign up. I have my, like, time frame here because there's no point in signing up. I'm going to sign up next week because I'm going to need to sign up by September 1st. So I'm just going to do it next week. Perfect. Is that next week to 27? Yeah. Yeah, I have it right here, PC Recruiter. Set it up. Yeah, I'll sign up next week, and we'll be good to go. All right, then I will keep an eye out for it. And once you sign, then I'll send the invoice. Once that's paid, we'll be ready to get the link set up and created. All right, great. Yeah, I'm also just waiting for my domain and email, which actually just finally got solved. Microsoft looks freaking forever. So I'm setting up my email. Actually, right now I'm calling the guy that helped me set up. So we're getting there little by little. Very good. Can I help forward if there's anything I should need or any questions? And if you need it, I'll give me a call. Will do. Thank you so much. All right. Fantastic. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye. Bye now.",
