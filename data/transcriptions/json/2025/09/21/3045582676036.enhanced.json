    "text": " Hello? Hi, is this Mary Barker? Yes, it is. Hi, Mary. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Hi, how are you? I'm good. I was reaching out because we switched billing systems, and I know your account's on hold, but the hold fee payments aren't going through because the card information has to be entered in a new site. Well, your main number is not working, and then I saw, like, your email were bouncing back as well. So that's why I'm calling your cell phone. I hate to call your cell phone, but that's the only number we had to reach you guys. Well, no, that's okay. Well, we retired last November, and we were hoping to sell the database. We were hoping to sell it, but it's not looking that way. So as far as we're concerned, you know, I don't know what you have to do. Just get rid of it. We haven't even opened it since the last time probably my husband talked to somebody there and just whatever. But, yeah, we're retired. Okay. I can't, like, go against the contract. I'm going to run it by Bill Kubitschek and see what he says. I know you guys have been around for a while. So let me talk to Bill. And then can I get a better email? Yes, exactly. Would it be okay if I call your cell phone or is there an email? My email address, maybe a personal one? My email address, my new email address is MaryJB, and then Barker. There's two Bs, MaryJBBarker at gmail.com. Okay. And Bill is the one that my husband talked to. Okay. I'm just curious. You're saying I can't go against the contract. What does that mean? well normally there's a contract that's signed it auto renews and things like that so to kind of override that or whatever i just want to talk to bill first and see what he says yeah yeah so he talked to my husband doug so okay because we were we had some guy that strung us along for several months saying he was going to buy it and of course the database is what you want and then he backed out. So we just are, we're not even trying to sell it anymore. We're just trying to stay retired and enjoy it. Good for you. I'd say 49 years is long enough. Wow. That long. Wow. That long. I remember your, your name is even, even too back from my MRI days. When I worked at corporate. Oh, what's your name? Well, I'm Robin Montoni now, but way back then I was Robin Gordon. I worked with, like, Jerry Hill, Vince Agresti. Oh, my God, yes. We just hate ourselves, right? We certainly do. But you know what? Happy to still be waking up and in good shape and alive, right? Right. We've had so many wonderful years, I'll tell you, with MR. I miss all those days and all those names you threw out there. I know. I did, too. That was good. A lot of fun. It was a fun job. Good people. Good people help, you know. All right. Let me talk to, I will talk to Bill, and then I will reach out to you and let you know. Sound good? Okay. And if I don't answer, we are heading to a concert right now, something you don't normally get to do at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. and I won't have my phone on or you can email me and I'll get back to you no matter what you come up with. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much for taking my call. All right, Robin. All righty, bye. Thank you. Bye.",
