    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hi, Jim. Hey, how are you, Melanie? I'm good. How are you? I'm all right. I'm all right. Good to meet you. You as well. I appreciate you turning it around and jumping on a call so quick with me. No, no problem. No problem. So, yeah. So are you new to PC Recruiter? Yes. So I am both new to the company that I'm at now, RCI, as well as PC Recruiter. So I'll kind of give you a little background as to what I'm doing and what I'm trying to accomplish, and then I'll kind of let you walk me through, like, next steps. Sure. Essentially, I was brought in as the chief of staff to Nisha, who's the CEO at RCI. She really wants me to essentially evaluate the products that we're using, all of our processes, and make sure that we're set up for, you know, first off, using them to the best of their ability. Two, that they are the right tools. And then three, how do we scale with these tools? Are we set up and using them in a way that allows us to scale our business for growth, you know, expansion, depending on kind of what our next steps are. So I'm coming in here and my first big one that I'm looking at is PC Recruiter because it's such a heart of our business in terms of, you know, our staffing side, the business that we are in. We work with the state and local government in the New Jersey and New York area. And so making sure that we are tracking everything that we are doing, first of all, but making sure that the tool is – I'm already seeing some opportunities for are there ways that we could do X or Y to help save for our recruiting team, save them time, improve their process, make it more efficient. In the meantime, I'm looking at, you know, what does our user licenses look like? I think we have two. How do they, you know, what are we paying for them? And then how are they evaluated? Are there other user licenses that we could get that's, you know, is there a version of a light user that, you know, someone who wants to log in and look around but not, you know, necessarily make any changes? Is that, you know, an option? trainings and webinars. Tyler introduced me to the LMS, which I'm really excited about jumping into. Does it integrate with any other tools? So we're looking at, you know, are there AI resume formatting tools that we could adopt to help us cut down on how long it takes us to format resumes? Passport is a big tool that our sales team uses where they, you know, understand what roles that we're going after. Does it, you know, does it integrate with any of these other systems out there. So I know that was a lot. So feel free to like ask any clarifying questions. But right now, my goal is to understand how it's set up from a user admin perspective, the licensing for it. And then if there's opportunities for us to dig into some more training and webinars, you know, the main recruiter that uses it for our team, you know, She's like, it's been a while since I've done any trainings. So she's like, honestly, you know, it might not hurt for me to go back through and watch some of the trainings, too, if it's something that I'm going to spend time on, too. So that is kind of my goal. I hope that helps you kind of understand why I started reaching out this week. Oh, for sure. For sure. For sure, yeah. So right now it looks like you all are two users on PC Recruiter. You're on our premium package. So you've got just about everything. The only thing you don't have is the AI Suite, which is on a free trial. So it's actually in there anyway for the summer. So the AI Suite is the only thing you don't have as part of the package, but you're on premium. So that's very good. You do have the ability. Just to clarify, so we are on premium, but we don't have the AI Suite package. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's Premium Plus. That's the AI suite. So that doesn't have it. But you really do have it because it's in there for a trial this summer. They turned on a trial of it a couple of weeks ago for the rest of the summer. So it is in there. Any idea when that ends? Around Labor Day, so early September. So it'll be there and give that a try there. You are two users right now, and if you need it, you do have an admin user. So all PC Recruiter accounts have an admin user, which is in there free of charge. It's primarily to go in if you ever forget a password, if you need to change a user, you need to kind of do anything in the system. It's kind of like a backdoor just in case you happen to forget a password or something like that. it is their no charge and it's also something you can use if you have someone that would occasionally need to log in to just run a quick report or do a quick search or do a little data cleanup or something like that so you do have an admin username there i don't know if you're using it or not but that is something that's available free of charge if you need it so if you're two users let's go see how often they're using uh because i can see yeah and i would love to know Can you see the admin, what email address it's attached to? I can't. It's going to be the admin username, A-B-M-I-N. You should be able to find the username in your database and see if it's attached to any email address. Okay. So let me look here. So you were saying we have an admin account plus the two users. So really that's technically like three logins. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And it looks like your admin last logged in on August 6th, so yesterday. And there's one other user, PG, which last logged in on August 6th as well. The last user before that was GB, and that's been a couple of years. So it looks like your two users, one of them is using the free included admin anyway. So we might be able to get you adjusted to one if you don't have anyone else use it. So, GB is now using the admin account. Might be, yeah. So, you mentioned that admin can run reports. Is there any other differences between the admin accounts and then just the user accounts? No, the only difference is it's not an initial username, it's admin. and it isn't something if you're going to be using it heavily every day you wouldn't want to use it because it's not meant for that so you wouldn't really want to necessarily connect an outgoing mail to it or anything like that because it's it's not designed for full-time use so if you had someone it looks like they've only logged on to admin ten times this month that's about once a day so that that person might be using full-time yeah PG has only logged on six times this month still. They could be using full-time as well. So if you wanted, you could have whomever is using admin go back to their other name and keep it at the two users. Or if they really weren't using all that much, they could stay on the admin and we could drop you to one user and have that admin there if it was being used kind of light. Okay. I'll have to talk to them and understand. It could have just been... Yeah, I'm not sure what switched him from being, like, why he would have chosen the admin account over the user account. But, yeah, okay, we'll figure that out. I mean, they're already paying for the three accounts. We may keep it that way. And I might see if he will go back to using his GB account. That way we can use the admin account. Can the users, can they run reports as well? Or is that strictly an admin? Okay. So the users can run reports. And a cool thing, too, if you wanted all of your users to be admin level, you could do that. So they could all have admin level permissions if you wish. Okay. My guess is that's like a higher cost based on like the version of – oh, it's not? Nope. Our users, we don't have any like light users, expensive users, cheap users. It's all the same rate. But then the users could have whatever permission level you wish. So they could be a full admin user or they could be real limited down. That's up to you. But that wouldn't change the cost of everything. Okay. And the admin themselves can modify and control a user's privileges? Mm-hmm. Okay. That's something we could call you for. Yeah. As well as anyone else with admin permissions. So if all three of your users had admin permissions, all three of them could control users' permissions, preferences, what have you. Okay. That makes sense. That's pretty standard. but good to know that the level of usage per account does not matter. Does it affect the cost? Okay. Yeah, that doesn't affect or change anything, so you're all good there. Okay. Okay, can you talk to me about trainings, webinars, that type of thing? Well, webinars, every now and then they'll put on webinars from time to time. They haven't really been putting on any lately that I know of. So there's no webinars. There's some recorded ones online now. So our YouTube channel, the Main Sequence Technology YouTube channel, might be a useful place to look at. There's some older ones in there that might help. And then training. You can get training anytime you'd like. So what you can do is you can purchase hours of training. They're $95 an hour or $80 an hour if you buy a block of four or more. so anytime you want to buy any training time when you buy it it never expires you can use it to cover anything and everything you'd like okay so you can do that so anytime you want to do that let me know and I can invoice send you an invoice for however many an hour or how many hours you want and then we can get those in queue and then the trainer like I said you can cover anything you'd like they never expire and you can cover anything and everything in the system. Okay. Okay. I mentioned integrations as well. Does PC Recruiter integrate with many tools? Well, we do. We integrate with a few different phone systems like RingCentral, Google Voice, Zoom Phone. So you can integrate by click to dial there. We integrate with Quill, which is going to be like a one of those meeting note takers so it'll kind of leave those notes into the system so quill is one that we interface with we can share jobs with zoom info indeed zip recruiter so you can set up feeds to those and then also through our capture tool you have the ability to import from LinkedIn dice indeed a bunch of other products I don't know if you're using capture but the capture tool would give you the ability to import from a number of different sites so that's going to import data there those are probably the biggest things that we interfere with we don't interface with anything to help build resumes or anything that I know of that I've ever heard of I don't have anything like that was my next question okay we don't have anything like that that I aware of you'd have to edit your resumes within PC recruiter and then save a second copy or third copy or whatever from there we do have kind of along those lines part of the AI suite is a candidate summary generator so you do have the ability on every candidate record and PC recruiter there's going to be a summary option if you go into that summary option there's going to be a small AI button it looks like a blue and purple hexagon and that is going to if you click that on a record it's going to take into account all the information to found in their resume and in their fields in their record and it's going to generate a custom candidate summary for you so that is going to kind of build a little summary if you wanted to kind of check that out so that might help okay interesting I think that's all of the main things we interfaced with. Okay. I just took notes from them, so that's helpful. The LinkedIn, we use LinkedIn a lot, so I think I need to dig into. some of those that you were talking about, importing from LinkedIn and that type of thing, is the system already set up to do that? We just need to basically do it? Or is that something that you have to, you know, you pay per tool that you're connected to or anything like that? No, that is just you make sure you download the PC Recruiter Capture app. It's in the Google App Store. And when you download that app connected to your database, it's going to put on a little click to add button anytime you're looking at anyone's record on LinkedIn or Indeed or Resume Library or Facebook or any of these sites that it works with. And it lists all the sites it works with but it'll put a little add to PC recruiter button right as soon as you're looking at a record. So you just click the button import from there. And it imports, creates a record, brings in the photo, brings in their contact info and brings in a searchable copy of their summary. Okay, and this is like a manual, right? So it's not going to just automatically sync or pull information. I can dictate what account and what information from that account comes over? Yeah, it's not automatic. We don't do anything that automatically overwrites or anything like that. But as you go to a record, it'll tell you first if the person's in your database or not. If they're in your database, it'll give you an option to review the data against your database. So essentially, it'll show you here's the data found in LinkedIn versus what is found in your database. You can toggle between each field and pick which one you want to choose. And then you can update it that way. If a person is not in the database, it'll just click to add the record right in. And then it'll import their photo, their information, their summary. It'll create a record there. Is it reading off of their email address? Is that how it recognizes that they exist? Or if we already have their LinkedIn link? Their LinkedIn summary. LinkedIn summary. And I think it also looks at their LinkedIn summary link. But I think it also looks at their information. Because sometimes you'll get this is an exact match by link. But then other times you'll get this might be a dupe because we've noticed the same first and last name is in your system. So we'll give you a couple of options. and it'll show you kind of how if it's an exact match because it's the same LinkedIn. In summary, that's going to be absolutely a match versus the other way it may be a match or it may not be. Okay. Yeah, we would probably have a lot of accounts that have very similar first name, last names, just based on kind of where the applicants are from. There's just a lot of crossover. So keeping it clean is kind of one of those scary, hard-to-do, making sure we don't accidentally link the wrong applicant with the wrong account. So, that is not automatic because that would scare me. Okay. Well, that's really helpful. I'm going to look into them more on LinkedIn. I don't know if they have ever prior to me, I don't know if they've looked at using it or tried to use it, but I will ask and dig into examples a bit more. The trainings, I don't know that I want to just, you know, for me, that I want to go down the paid route at this point while I'm kind of like evaluating everything. So, I may just try to see what else I can find for trainings. So, that's good to know there. Check out the YouTube channel. YouTube channel, the Learning Center, learning.pcrecruiter.net. That has a whole lot of help and assistance and step-by-step instructions and such, so that might be helpful as well. Okay. Well, yeah, I'll do that. The licenses, do we pay those on a monthly or are they on a yearly basis? Well, they're usually under a year contract, but usually they're paid monthly. Let's look. I have you listed as invoice monthly. Yep, so you are invoice monthly. And let's look at when your most agreement was signed. Most of our contracts are a one-year agreement. So it looks like you pay monthly and you are under a one-year agreement, which runs November 13th of each year. So you're under agreement. It auto-renews for another year each year. So your next auto-renew will happen on November 13th of this year for another one year. Okay. That's good to know. That gives me a couple months to buy it, too. Cool. Okay. Okay. I think that's most of my questions. I just wanted to get a quick introduction and then understand a few things and go from there. So I appreciate your time, Jim. or if there's anything else you think would be helpful for me as I kind of like go down this rabbit hole. Because my assumption is that we're underutilizing it and there's a lot of opportunity for us to use it and hopefully save us some time and make sure that we're – I'm a little worried that all the, you know, the organizational opportunities within the system, making sure everybody that's in is clean, that we haven't been duplicating accounts, that, you know, all of that, I think is going to take some time to, like, kind of sift through and see how we were doing it. But that's kind of where I'm at is just what are we using it for and where else could we kind of tap into some of the features, even just the simplicity of a dashboard when you first log in. I don't even think they have been using that as a concept. So, I'm going to build that out so that there's a quick glance as to what's going on in the first login. So I will dig into that on our side. But is there anything else you can tell me that you think would be helpful for me to know? Or do you do? So I know I briefly talked to Tyler for support or questions that we have if we do run into something. Is it best, is there an email address it's best to reach out to? What's the process for that? If it's a training slash functionality question. training functionality call in our support team and our main number at nine four six five two one four that would get you into the main support team there's an option there and anyone who answers can help or you can always email support at main sequence dotnet and that will actually put a trade a ticket into our system and queue it up for someone to give you a call call back so you can begin email that too and any one of those four people should be able how about with that? Okay. Good to know. Well, all right. That's it. That's all the questions I have. Very well. Anything else you need, let me know. Or if you don't know who to go to, let me know and I can help you or get you to someone who can. Sounds good. Thanks, Jim. I appreciate it. Alrighty. My pleasure, Melanie. Thank you. Bye. Bye now.",
