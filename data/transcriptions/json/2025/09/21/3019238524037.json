    "text": " Thank you for calling Joe Brown. Please say your name after the tone. Press the pound key after you finish recording. Jim with PC Recruiter. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hey, Jim. How you doing? I am well. Joe, how are you? Oh, good, good, good. I'm used to talking to Jim Wise. Jim? I guess he's retired, huh? He is. He's heading toward retirement, so he's phasing himself out here at Main Sequence. I'm going to kind of take it over the things for him, but he's doing very well. When you talk to him, hopefully he remembers me telling him that Joe Brown from Genesis said, Hey, and well wishes on retirement. He's a great guy. Really nice guy. I'm having lunch with him on Monday, so I'll pass that along. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. That's good. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. So I wanted to give you a call and kind of help get your account closed. Why are you leaving? Why are you closing it? I don't know if your email address is there. Yeah. I've been with you guys for a long time. I think it's been 10 years or maybe more. I think I was at a different company that was Arch. I think it may have been 12 years total. But the reason is I use LocksLow currently and have been for the past five years. And I talked to Bill kind of. I think that some of their things that we were doing didn't really align with the agenda of PC Recruiter. and so we held on to it I held on to it because I was using it for the job board which was great it was built, Bill's son Jack built my website and his company and so things were really you know it was designed with the job board it was working well but of recent last couple months I switched to another company that's called Top Echelon. And they have a system that posts our jobs and as well as the network jobs to our website. So it's kind of redundant. That was really the main reason that I was kind of holding on to PC Recruiter because I really wasn't using it as an ATS or CRM, but more for the job board. So now that that has gone, it's kind of given me the reason, like there's really no reason for me to continue to have it. You know, I'm essentially having three ATS systems. For sure. I get it. And they have a nice split network too, don't they? Exactly. A nice split network too, so I get that. Yeah. So it's kind of, yeah, I was telling Drew, you know, really, that's the thing about PC Recruiter I don't think I've met a vendor service provider that's had greater people you guys are just, everybody's great you know the Jakes I mean everybody is just outstanding and I think over the many years I've maybe had one incident of someone that it wasn't a good experience, but everybody else has been outstanding. So I hate to part ways, but it's just kind of, you know, it's making sense right now for me not to spend the money and, you know, and not use it. The thing is, is it's just sitting there at this point, you know. Sure. Yeah. So, yeah, kind of. Yeah. Yeah, the Pop Echelon Network kind of, it's a blend between an ATS and a network. And so that's what kind of, you know, I was like, well, I was really reluctant. I talked to Drew about this a lot, and I was really reluctant to kind of do it. But once I tried, now it's up and running on the website, and it's great. And people are applying, and I get, you know, I get paid if people apply. It's kind of like it's hard to say no. you know it's a it's one of those offers i just couldn't it was so hard i couldn't say no for sure no i totally get that i totally get that it does make sense so we appreciate you using us all this time and and uh what we'll do i will go ahead and get a ticket into our system to get everything closed out okay i'll get the data return request in there's 175 cost to do that so be aware they'll they'll send out a required form they'll have to have you sign and then the invoice once that's signed to get everything going. Got it. And I can't say how long it'll take because it goes through a couple of people on the support team, but they'll get working on it pretty soon here. And then the only other thing I took note, my accounting team will know for sure. It looks like your contract goes until October, so there might be a couple of months left on that. I don't know if they'll do an early termination. If they do, it's 80% of remaining payments due. Just a heads up, if they happen to come, so you're not blindsided by it. Oh, so why would I, do you know why that agreement is in there? It should have been just kind of a month to month. Well, it looks like when it was signed, it was always a one year and it just auto renewed each year. So that's what it is. Oh, so they auto renewed me for one year agreements every year? Each year. Yep. But it looks like you're, it's through October. It was originally in 2016. Yeah. October 16th or October 17th. And you might be able to plead out. Yeah, I don't know if they can do it. If you could, Jim, send me that information as well as any fees that's involved, just email it over to me so that I can kind of know what I'm up against. And also, please turn off the recurring whatever that monthly thing is. for now, I just don't want to be charged for it. I'll kind of work out whatever it is that's outstanding or whatever and kind of figure out the best time for it. It wouldn't be outrageous. If it was an early termination, it would probably be at most three months. So 75 times 3 times 80%. That's like $180. It might only be two months. It's not like it's thousands of dollars. I want to make you aware. I'll pop you an email just to kind of outline that as well and Robin and Nick are the two support key members that will kind of they know exactly how much it is and they can let you know oh good good and then yeah and then the whatever the download the zip file and and how much that's gonna how much it's gonna be I just kind of need to know all that stuff up for us I will reply to the email that you sent me earlier today with that and that I'll get the ticket in queue so it's underway okay sounds good well thank you so much for your Tom, thanks for jumping on that quickly, and then I'll look out for your email. All right. Sounds good. Okay. Have a good one. Take care. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.",
