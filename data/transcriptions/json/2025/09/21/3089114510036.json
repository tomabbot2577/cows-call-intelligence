    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. May I help you? Hi, Garrett. I've noticed that some of our search parameters are missing. This is Eileen with Higher Excellence. And I wanted to see if there was something that was there an update. Do you know why that would have happened? So you're talking about the drop downs in the basic search? Yeah. Okay, so that's customizable. Maybe there was an edit to your username search customization. You can also, people can copy their settings over to you if you, just an admin can do that. So I'll show you how to set that back. So if you just want to go to the, it's like you see basic search on the left, but then there's a action menu, three horizontal lines on that top frame. And there should be a gear icon to customize. It'll open up a pop-up window where there's available and then selected fields. So we recommend usually just having the selected fields completely empty. And if that right panel is completely empty, it would mean that all fields are available for searching. And you can kind of clear out whatever's in the right field with the minus sign next to each field. Oh. Otherwise, it's only going to show you what's in the selected field. Ah, okay. That explains it. And is that for custom as well, for a custom search? For the, you mean the advanced search? Yeah, it applies to both basic and advanced. Oh, okay. So I did that. I had a feeling. And then I did a, I got a new laptop, so I reloaded PC, you know, everything on there. And I think I might have, I don't know, I have this Outlook portal. I think I, I don't know if I was even supposed to download that, you know, to be able to parse resumes from Outlook. Okay, yeah. Is that the PCR portal for Microsoft Outlook download? Yeah, and it is only compatible with Outlook Classic. So if you did get a new computer, you might have Outlook New on it. But yeah, we're only compatible. Oh, you got Classic. Yeah, you've been Classic. It said the number was outdated, I think, in the call. Okay, I can give you the serial number if you need it. just you'll probably need to close that about look and re-enter it or reopen it and I can it'll prompt you to put in the serial number okay hmm what are you thinking here Oh, sometimes Outlook has trouble closing down. I've noticed a trick to make it fully closed down so that you're able to open it again. Let's see. to if you right click on the Windows icon at the bottom of your screen it will give you an option to go to task manager. Okay. And then you can select Outlook and task on that. Yeah. I don't know why it's him. I just clicked on Outlook and closed it but I'm not wanting to open now. So that's awesome. Let's see what else we got going here. Okay. Well, this doesn't want to open. If you go to your date and time at the bottom right of your screen, there's a couple icons down there. Click the up arrow. It'll show you if Outlook is still listed there, but it might be grayed out. Yeah, it's closing, yeah. Okay, so yeah, it's still having trouble closing, so if you do wanna go to the Task Manager and force close it in Task, that'll probably help it get closed. Doesn't show it in there under Apps. Oh, scroll down, it might be under Background I think it's called background processes. Oh, processes. Okay. Wow. We have a lot going on here. Jeez. Yeah. It's surprising how much runs on the computer just all the time. I'm always fascinated with how much is actually going on. Wow. Jeez. Yeah. This past manager looks different than the old one. Okay. Okay. There. Yeah. There you go. I think there were two open, so that's great. Yeah, okay. Serial number? All right. So that's for higher excellence. I just had it. There it is. It is 867-903-670-383-412. Should I write that down so I have it or no? You can if you want. It's not a huge deal. It's only when you first are putting it on your computer that you'll need that. Oh, okay. So it should be fine. And once you get the serial number in there, we'll still need to make the connection over to your username inside of the PCR Outlook. So I can walk you through that. I was saying it's expired. Oh, that's okay. I can refresh that over on my end right now. Let me do that, actually. One second. I just said okay. That's fine. Next, if you go to – you should see the PC Recruiter tab up at the top in the main menu of Outlook next to, like, file and home and stuff. Yeah, I do. Excellent. So if you see that, there should be underneath that tab, it should be like a options with a green wrench. Okay, perfect. Once you click on that, there's a button that will allow you to add connection towards the top. Okay, yeah. And it'll prompt you for your PCR web address. So, just jump over to PCR in your browser and copy that full web address. And then hit go? Exactly, yeah. And that's when you should see a prompt for your PCR username and password. And it's probably asking you for your database as well from a dropdown. Yeah. Yeah, it's setting up. Perfect. Okay. Okay, great. Well, thanks so much for your help. No problem. You might see a spot where you can enter a password again on the pop up towards the bottom. So just enter it one more time. And above that, there'll be a checkbox to remember my password a little bit higher. Oh, I see. Yeah, that should get that set for you. And I think that's it. Oh, there is one other setting we can look at, too, once you get that connected. Should I hit save and close? Up at the top, hit test connection once. There's a success message we're hoping to see. Yes, we are. Okay, then save and close is good. The last thing when you're setting up Outlook, I would go to file in the main menu of Outlook, the top left, and then let's see, go down to options at the bottom left. Okay. And in the middle of those options are like two radio buttons. One of them says optimize for compatibility. That should be the one selected instead of optimize the other one. I don't know what it's best appearance. Yeah. So you want the compatibility selected. Okay. Just hit save. And yeah, that should be it. And I reset your license so you won't see any more pop-ups next time you open Outlook about license expired, you should be all set. Awesome. Well, thanks so much. I think I got the capture in there. Let me make sure. Oh, yeah. We can walk through that. Oh, I did. It's fine. Okay, good. Okay, good. All right. Awesome. Well, thanks for your help. I really appreciate it. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Will do. Thank you.",
