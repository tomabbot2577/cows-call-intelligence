    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, are you in sales or are you in support? Support. Okay. I got you by accident because I actually hit option two and it sent me to, I guess, option four, support. So can you transfer me over to sales, please? Sure. One second here. Garrett, for you. All right. It went to voicemail there. They might be on another call. I can forward you to Jim Lombardo's voicemail. He's head of sales. I sent him an email yesterday, and that's part of the frustration. I haven't heard back from him. Let me ask you a question while I got you, and then I'll let you transfer me after I ask this question. The question I had was about PCRM, and I was wondering how prevalent is that? Because I haven't heard about that until yesterday. Is that been out there for a long time or is it pretty new or what is that? Yeah, it's pretty new. It's a different interface for your database. So updated look, a little bit slimmed down with the number of features. But it's just going to be your same database if you get an upgrade to PCRM. Or you're just logging in and it looks a little bit different navigating around. Okay, so do the same integrations that work with the PCR9 I'm using now, do the same integrations work with that, like the Call Mantra or RingCentral, all those things? Any change there? RingCentral works with PCRM for sure. It'll still connect up with your email. And what did you mention as the other integration? CallMantra. Oh, I'm not sure I haven't heard of that one, but most likely I can talk to my team and get back to you about that particular integration. But if it is working with 9, it should be fine to work with PCRM. Well, they list PCR as one of their integrations, and it's basically like RingCentral except for the fact that it adds some features like, you know, when you're on a person's record, you know, you can do a more personalized message to them and all that kind of stuff based on the record. So that's a little different at RingCentral. So that's why I was curious if it was relabeled. Okay. Well, that's fine. Well, send me over to Jim's voicemail and I'll try and go from there. That sounds good. I'll transfer you now. Thanks. And just reach out if you need anything else. Will do. Thank you. Thanks.",
