It's an option in system global changes. There's an option called rename custom field. The only thing about that, though, is if you're using it in, like, a form letter, a profile, a PCR job board, you would need to reselect it. It'll change it on your layout. But other places, like, again, form letter, job board, profile, it cannot change it there. That would have to be manually reselected. I'll shoot you an email as well. Thanks. Bye.",
