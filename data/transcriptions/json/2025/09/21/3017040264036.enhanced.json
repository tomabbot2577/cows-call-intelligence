    "text": " Hello, this is Thomas. Hi, Thomas. This is Robin Montoni. I'm so sorry for the delay in getting back to you. Yeah, that's okay. All right. Yeah, I got a new card because the other one got compromised. So I'm ready when you are. So let me figure this out because I feel like this new site wants really you to do it through the billing portal. Let me see if we could try it. I'd try to. I'd prefer that, but it wouldn't allow me. Did you sign up through the billing portal? I don't know okay let me have you do that maybe let's see okay because I think I kind of like want your permission and stuff okay so let me do this for you one second go back out sure okay Okay, I'm sending you an invite to the customer billing portal. Can we do a screen share? Yeah. Okay. Do you have RingCentral or would you prefer Google Meet? I don't have either. Okay, I'll just do a Google Meet then. Okay. So I got your mail. Should I log in here? So what you're going to have to do, if you haven't signed up for that customer billing portal, you'll need to, I think it says sign up or create an account. Can I just give you my card number and we'd be done with this? Well, I don't think it's going to let me save it as auto pay and stuff. We could try it. I just don't know if it will. Let's see. Add new card. Okay. What's the name on the card? Thomas Freund. E-U-N-D. E-U-N-D. Okay. And what is the card number? It is 5178-0595-6437-8728. 5178-0595 6437-8728 That's correct. Okay. Month and year? 11-29 Sounds like a long time away, doesn't it? VVC That's at 015 Yeah, 015 And is it Portland, Maine? Well, the billing address is South Portland, Maine. okay 04-101 no that's the office address the billing address on the card would be 04-106. okay let me add this 8728 is the new one Okay. Oh, it did save the time. Okay. Do you want to try processing it again? I'm sorry. Should I go ahead and try to reprocess it now? Yes. Okay. I see it on the screen now that you'll put it in. Okay. Do I need to add the CVV again? It says on the screen. Are you doing that? I should have the card stored for you. That doesn't let me take out a card, but you can if you want to take out the old card. Might as well. Well, it doesn't really matter, I guess. It's dead. Okay. Let me send you a Google Meet because then I can show you this customer billing portal. I'm already on it. Oh, okay. So did you do the sign-up and everything? Yeah, I already paid, so I think we're good. Okay. So if you go over to the vault area, I think I'm going to show you an invoices over in the right where it says vault. Yeah. That's where you should now see your cards. Yeah. Okay. And then you should be able to, yeah, you can delete the other one. It doesn't let me delete it. Yeah, that's okay. Like, it wouldn't matter. It's dead. You know, it's good. Yeah. Okay, good. So it looks like I'm all paid. Everything's all set. Yeah. So this is on autopay now, right? Yes, autopay. Okay, good. For $87.28. And then if you ever want to, you know, check your invoices, you know, even go back and print one or something like that, that vault area or that customer portal area is very helpful for that. All right, yeah. I'll save it under my favorite here. Okay, all set. Okay. Appreciate it. Wonderful. Thank you. Okay. Sorry about the delay. That's okay. Okay, thanks. Bye-bye. Bye.",
