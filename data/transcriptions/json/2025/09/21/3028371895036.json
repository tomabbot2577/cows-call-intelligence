Please leave a message after the tone. Good morning, Lindsay. This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I received your ticket here asking about the AI integration with PC Recruiter. And that is something that we've given away as a free trial for the summer through about Labor Day or thereabouts. but you likely did notice that the search was not in the ticket so what I'm going to do is I'm going to submit a ticket to have that search added to your database so the AI search will be enabled reason it wasn't added by default is it requires the Lucene search engine which I'm not sure if you have because some people don't so what we're also doing is upgrading you to the reindex Lucene search at no cost so you can try the AI trial see what you think so I'll get that ticket in if my guys have any questions or anything or if it If it doesn't need upgraded to Lucene, they'll just go ahead and do it. You'll notice it. You'll likely see the ticket notification. They might be in touch if they have any questions around that upgrade. If you have any questions for me, please give me a call at 440-856-0314, and I'm going to get that ticket in to have the Lucene search, or rather the AI search added to your database. Thanks, Lucy. Take care. Bye-bye.",
