Hi, I'm Scott Harreld. I'm not here to take your call, but leave me a message and a phone number I can reach you, and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Have a good day. Good afternoon, Scott. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give a call. I was introduced to you by Brian Denton, but I tried to reach you by phone here to talk a little bit about getting you up and running on PC Recruiter. It looks like there's an old database we have that we want to get turned back on and also maybe a conversion of a big dealer one. I wanted to chat more about that and see if we can get things underway. If you want to give me a call, my phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I'll also reply to your email as well and hopefully we can connect soon. Thanks, sir. I'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
