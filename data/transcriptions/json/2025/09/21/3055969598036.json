I have offices. I have a lot of different things that I need to delay or something because there is no way like it's just two weeks left and they haven't done the interview yet. I don't know what's going to happen, when they're going to. Maybe they will schedule in September. And then after that, I have a full apartment here. So there is no way I will be able to move in like three weeks or month time. There is no way. It's going to go wasted. That's the only thing. Maybe if things go smoothly, let's say in the next two or three weeks, let's say they've done it. Maybe I can see myself being there in November or December. And then I will ask you if you can think to do it early. If not, then it's okay. But for the safe side, I'm adding the time and everything, keeping it in January, because that will be the better way to do it. That's what I think. But if anything, I get an update as soon as I hear, I will let you know about that for sure. Perfect. And I'll let you know just to make sure we can do it. I think we can. I just need to talk with Robin so we can put everything on hold. Yeah, yeah. Just let them know about my situation. and if they wanted to approve on that, I can definitely send you those emails and I'll keep sending it to the investing counsel. But just for sure, if you mean the record is a genuine issue, I will not be using it, right? So what I'm going to do with this, like until I get the visa done and then I physically move there, I will not be using it at all. So that's the only thing, you know. Okay. Yeah, should be no problem at all, but I'll confirm it. Let me know once you know more or if anything's going on. Yeah, I will 100%. I'll definitely give you a portion on those things, okay? Fantastic. All right. We'll talk to you soon. All right, Jim. All right. Thanks a lot. Take care. Have a good day. Cheers. Bye. You too. Bye.",
