    "text": " Here we go. That's right now. Hi, Jim. Hopefully this will be better. Hi there. Do you hear me okay? Yeah, we do. Awesome. Yeah, sometimes a speaker, it's trying to quiet it because it's hearing or something, the echoes sometimes cause that to act a little weird. Okay, so looking at PC Recruiter, so kind of one of the biggest changes is going to be that the menu bar is down the left-hand side. A lot of these are going to be the same terminology as you're used to. Some of them may be the same screen. So you see like the analytics and sequences, for example, those are the identical screen as is in PCR 9. Because when these two features were designed, we were already working on PCRM. So thus, they work just the same. So you'll be able to look at your exact same analytics, your exact same sequencing. Those two are very much the same. I think the schedule is also pretty much the same because that though it's pushed in the new interface, it kind of looks the same. But we have made some big changes to how the names, the companies and the positions look Something useful. We did is we took and we made it so that all three all three screens work the same. So if you go into the screen, you're going to have an area here where you see your most recently viewed records. You're going to have the ability to edit in line. So you can edit right on the main menu there. You could take a number of actions right from here. You can contact them via email, call, SMS. You can add an activity, add a note, add them to a roll-up. So you can do some different things through here right off of the main screen here. Then if you click on the icon, that's going to open the screen. It's going to slide in from the far right, and it's going to be entirely configurable. Now what's nice about this is if you know how to use the interface, you can go to Companies, all the same stuff, just Company Records. So it's going to be very easy for newer users to pick up and it's a lot easier to use, a lot easier to figure out. It just makes more sense is what people have told me. So if you're looking at the record, what we've now done, a lot of these areas up here are going to be the same terminology you're used to, resumes, activities, notes, keywords. But what we've added is we've actually added something called workspace. And that's going to essentially be your default workspace. When you land on a record, this is going to give you kind of your workspace, the main page you're going to look at. You can put kind of your commonly used fields, maybe the resume, maybe the activities. So you want to show some of the basic information right on that workspace. Then you can delve deeper into any of these if you want to look at what roll-up lists the person is on. Or you want to look at their notes or their resumes. One thing we've done is we've given you the ability to add, I think, unlimited resumes here. So you can kind of title additional resumes, put different tabs in here. Where you see I have two, you can keep adding them on through there. So you can have multiple resumes in there. Another cool thing we've done with the interface when you're looking at the keywords, if you're tagging people, you can actually right-click and you can tag that up in the main, kind of in the header. Up at the top, kind of next to Terry's name, I've got three keyword tags that I've put up there at the top. So it gives you some different tagging capabilities in there as well. Another thing I like about the records, if I go into details, I have a nice easy search here. So if I'm looking for phone number fields, I just type in phone. It's going to filter those instantly. Or if I need to see my foreign language fields, see what language he might speak, I can type in that. Or I can even type in any possible languages I might have. So I can kind of instantly search all the data, kind of zero in on what I'm looking for there. So a lot of these and these are cool because if you want to move your attachments over I just drag it It's going to snap over real time So you see the interface is a little easier to configure than it has been in the past Now you're still going to have your names your companies your positions the positions are still going to have the same pipeline So if I go into my position menu again same same Functionality is the name menu, but if I go into a position I'm going to be able to open up that position record. It is going to be configurable. It also has a workspace and then your details is all of your fields. The pipeline is going to remain the same. So the pipeline that you're working with there, same exact pipeline. It works within here so that's going to look and work just the same. Okay, so a lot of it is kind of familiar, same terminology, new layout, new format there. Some things that are new that have have been added to PCRM. One is going to be the deals workflow. So the deals workflow is going to be like a sales pipeline, a sales funnel, if you will. And it's going to give you the ability to build essentially something very similar to the interview pipeline, only it's going to show you the different steps and kind of where things stand with all the deals you're working. So this is going to be something like a CRM. If you wanted to track different companies that you're working with, you can move them through a process here. You can decide that maybe my next step is going to be that I wanted to send an email I already checked off the call on the 9th so I can kind of put a few steps in here you could also edit if you wanted to make the temperature warm hot cold cool you can put a confidence level potential value projected close date and step two of this is going to be we're going to include some analytics reporting that's going to let you forecast based off of your deals pipeline so deals pipeline kind of add something we've been like it for a long time and people have been asking for so So it gives you the ability to kind of move people or move deals through a process there. And it works drag and drop, just like the interview pipeline. So you're going to have this function added. And there's a bunch of filters. You can filter it by owner, filter it by when it was created. You can filter it by the name of the deal, anything like that. So you're going to have the ability to kind of have this whole new piece of PC Recruiter that's been added for the deals pipeline. Another thing we've added, again taking feedback into account from others from users, people that were using the sequencing, they loved it but they found it a little difficult to set up sometimes because you have to go and you have to build the sequence and make all your steps and pick all your conditions and pick all your results and everything like that. So what we did was we kind of replaced the roll-up list stages with a simple sequence. So you can actually open a roll-up list and from that roll-up list there's now a simple sequence button added right there. So you can actually on the fly in a minute or so build the sequence. I can say first step is going to be an automatic email. I pick what email I want it to go to. I pick what form letter I want to use. Then I add another step. Maybe it'll be a call manual to the cell number. So I can kind of go through here and I can build this on the fly. And then as soon as I hit save all, that's going to create that and I can activate it right away. So I can create it, activated all at once right from the roll-up list. What's also nice is if I have a sequence, like this one here, I have a test sequence running in here. You can add a sequence column into your roll-up list, and it's going to show you where they stand in that sequence. So you can see, are they at the email stage or at the call stage? Have they gotten the second email? Anything like that. So that's another little bit simpler of a sequencing feature we've added to this version of PCRecruiter. And then one other area that's really changed, the reporting hasn't changed, it looks and works very much the same, like I said analytics, sequencing, that's all the same. Something that has changed though as well is going to be the addition, the parsing screen, the add records screen. So if I go up here to add records, I now have the ability to drag files in mass or one at a time into that box or what I can do is go down to name. If I'm adding a name maybe I can say I can put in a first name and then I can go ahead oh I wanted to add his company in here too I can actually go down here and all at once add a new company so I could say it's going to be X XYZ company so I can actually then without having yet added it I can toggle back over to the name I I can link him to a draft record of XYZ company. Maybe throw him on a roll-up list too. And maybe I want to upload another attachment here that I want to attach to the name record file that I'm about to create. I can do that too. So I can go ahead and upload attachments. I can link these two one another. I can do a check duplicate right on the fly there. It'll see if it's good or if it's a dupe. So it gives you a little more functionality in adding records into the database, which is kind of a nice function there. It gives you a little more ease of adding records and a little more options in there. Okay. So that kind of is, in a nutshell, the differences of PCRM. This new interface here, like I said, your search tabs up at the top, like if I looked up first and last it adds these little chips you can move them drag them X them out search that way you also have your more filters if you wanted to get additional search filters zip code radius your content search your boolean search all that's in here as well so it just gives you kind of a new interface running off the same database it gives you the added ability to utilize the deals workflow the simpler sequencing in a new interface if if you find that you like the way this looks and works better. It's easier to work at or easier to look at. So you could kind of have people using both. And there are no plans to discontinue PCR 9. It's still there. We're going to run both pieces, both products in the same database. And it's not to say years down the road maybe we'll find that everybody really has gravitated toward PCRM. Maybe someday, but right now PCRM and PCR 9 are both going to remain. Okay. Now, any questions? Any questions on anything we looked at in here or anything else you want to take a look at through the new system? This is my biggest question in sequencing because when we're cross-referencing, obviously there's going to be automated emails going to our prospects. So I'm just really curious, like, if you can take us through, I guess, what are the actions that are possible and if there's any delays, functions in that sequencing, just in general, like, what the capabilities are there. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So the sequencing, you can certainly do something like that. So I'll hop into it here. Sequences there. As you go through and you build your sequence, you would go up into templates, and you're going to have your different sequences here. So if you edit your branches, this is where you are able to decide what the first step is going to be. And then down in here, you can set up a delay. So if I wanted to go, what's the trigger going to be? Or delay next step by a certain number of days, a certain number of weeks, or days, hours, or minutes, I think you get. so you can kind of just set up a delay for the next step as well. So you go through and you pick your first step, then you pick from the various different results that could happen, and then what happens if that result does happen. So it could be a result or it could just be a delay. So maybe you send one email, then set a delay of two days, send another email, send a delay of two days. And I think another cool thing you can do when you go to the activate sequence, It's going to give you the ability to pick and choose what specific days you want to send it on. Maybe you only want to have it going on weekdays. You can pick start and stop times so that it'll only actually occur within that specific time frame that you wanted. You also can use a rate limiter so you can say I only want to do 50 per day. That's what I like to do when I send out a mass email. I usually only do 50 per day because it keeps them going out slower, keeps me able to respond to my replies a little bit easier. But so, yeah, on the activate sequence, you're going to be able to set up different limiters and things like that. Or one of your options, just like you might have a trigger, the trigger could be they click a link or they open the email. open the email or maybe they don't open it in four days or the underneath the line you can say I'm going to delay by x amount of days hours minutes so you can kind of pick that up and build it into the sequence wherever you wish great that's very cool thank you my next question is I know that obviously PCR9 has the time sequence based on periods that has changed on this one and and what that looks like? Did you see timekeeping, the timesheets? Not yet. That currently I don't think is in PCRM. That's one of the very few things that is not in PCRM. I think it may be, but I haven't heard when it's going to be. So I guess if we do decide to put down this software, we'll have to have both? Yeah, well, you'd have both no matter what because it's not a conversion or you don't go from one to another, you don't transition. You have both anyway. So everybody that wants could stop using PCR9, but it's still going to be there. And if you needed something like timesheets, there you'd still have to go to PCR9 to use it. But, yeah, right now they share the same database. So you would simply get a separate link from which you'd be able to access PCRM, but it's the same database. So you'd still have your own PCR9 there anyway. Okay. My next question, I guess, is on introductions. so right now a lot of our signed clients get signed to MailChimp. Is that possible? PCR, like, is there a native connection between them? It's the same database. So what I'm told by my support development team is that any integrations you have are still going to work because the database hasn't changed. So it's the same SQL database, so that's happening behind the scenes. So it wouldn't matter what interface you're using it's still going to work. I did have a question in terms of like sometimes we're sending a tailored documents to our prospects so do you have the capability to use personalized documents like a word document that can feel like depending on like the fields that they have um design not just like plain text that can be on the templates but like an actual documents, the design, everything that kind of just changes the placeholders according to the name, the name of the company, and other fields. I guess that's possible in PC Rec? Well you could do something like a template, like a form letter that might be a might have some blanks that they could fill in or you could utilize a candidate profile within PC Recruiter which is like a questionnaire they could be asked to fill out that could be part of your email so you could do either way there I think what she meant was like signing agreement for example oh like like a DocuSign integration yeah that that is actually very very close up next in our releases they're working on a DocuSign integration that will allow you to send as a step in that deals pipeline you You could have an agreement sent, they can DocuSign that and then that will be uploaded back into PCRecruiter as an attachment. So DocuSign integration isn't in the PCRM now, but it's coming. Okay. Anyone else have questions? My question is, so if you take this PCRM, Jim, so everything from the database that we have so far is going to be that also available in this in this pcrm right yes all the data is there just same same username and password and everything basically everything is two-way synchronized it's synchronized and only uh with this pcrm if there are some extra like extra things that we can do, basically go to new tables that the PCR wouldn't show it, but if they come back to the PCRM, then we would see them. Yeah, yeah. If you add something in PCRM that doesn't exist in 9, you wouldn't see it in 9, but you would see it in PCRM. But you're still going to see any changes you've made to records. You're most recently viewed is going to update if you're in one version or the other. They work seamlessly because they run on the exact same database. So, every single table that are in PCR basically, if it exists in PCRM, there are going to be two-way synchronization. Yeah, everything's two-way sync, yes, between the two databases, yes. Yeah, okay. So, it's just, you know, we're looking at, just to give you some feedback, Tim, we currently work with Pipedrive as a completely separate standalone to do our CRM reach-outs. It does allow for like a smart docs function where we can personalize and customize our agreements and proposals to go out to clients and we can DocuSign them within. The downside of it is because it's completely independent to PCR, we manually have to add everything into PCR ourselves. So that's sort of what we're kind of comparing it to is like, does it make sense for us to have a second tool? And that's what we're just trying to consolidate, whatever we can do. So it's nice to see some improvements happening on PCR. I still would leave a little bit of what we're doing out of scope, I think, for what we're kind of looking for. But it is good to see that PCR is moving forward in this way because we do still like the tool, especially for the timesheets and managing assignments and bulk mail and stuff. We use it a lot for even just sending out notices to all of our contractors that are working for us and so on. You let us know if there are any other improvements or anything. We will kind of take a look and discuss as a team, but it doesn't quite replace everything that we're sort of looking for at the moment. But if there are other features that are being released, please let us know. Okay, yeah, we're releasing it, but I'll let you know if I happen to hear of anything else coming out or releasing it that may be of interest to you. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. My pleasure. And any other questions, let me know, and I will let you know as I hear anything more being released. Excellent. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Thank you all. Bye-bye.",
