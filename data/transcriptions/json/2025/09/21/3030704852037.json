    "text": " Good morning, this is Trisha. Hi, Trisha. This is Jason calling from Main Sequence. I got your voicemail, and I just wanted to follow up with you. Hey, Jason. Thanks for giving me a call back so quickly. Yeah, absolutely. So you're having an issue with the resume parser. It's not, like, popping off the window? Right. Okay. So what's happening is it sounds like you're having an issue with the PCR launcher. Okay. So one second. There's two things I'm going to send you. So what we need to do is just run installs on these things. Are you using a Mac or a PC? PC. PC? Okay. Trisha, what company were you with again? I'm with Restoration Consulting Group. Okay. Did you change computers recently or anything? I'm pretty new. I've been here just for a couple weeks. So I've been kind of onboarding myself and watching tutorials and learning. Right, right. Okay. Let me get you put in. Can you spell your last name for me? Sure. It's M as in mom, C, N as in Nancy, A-U-G-H-T-O-N. Okay. And what is your email address? um it's my first name tricia t-r-i-c-i-a at restoration dash cg.com okay and you said t-r-i-c-i-a yes okay one second Trisha at restoration-cg.com? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to send you two things. One is Java. One is a download link for the PCR launcher. These are two pieces of software necessary for PCR to kind of perform different functions like opening the resume parser and attachments and things like that. So anytime you're getting any kind of issue with the resume parser or you can't open attachments, it tends to be this. These are device specific, so any changes to like using a new computer or just sometimes they just need to be repaired. Downloading these things will fix it. I would start by downloading the PCR launcher and see if that fixes it. If it doesn't, download Java and then download the launcher. But I'm going to send these over to you right now. But is there anything else I could help you with before? No, that's great. I really appreciate it so much. Yeah, absolutely. If you keep having issues with it, Tricia, just feel free to call us back and we'll hop on together. But I think this is going to fix it. Awesome. Thank you. Yep, absolutely. Bye. Bye.",
