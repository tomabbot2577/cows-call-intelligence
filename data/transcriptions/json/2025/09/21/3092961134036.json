I mean, like, so I have, you know, I go out to Ring Central. Well, let me, I'm in the midst of doing a recording right now, so maybe it won't give it to you until we're off the call or something like that. Yeah, but I don't understand why we don't have call recordings. I thought we were recording all these calls. We, we, I don't know that we, I don't think we record all calls by default. I think you have to enable that on a per call basis or something. Let me. I thought we did that. Maybe. I don't know. It may not be on for everybody. I'm not sure. I'd have to look in the RingCentral admin and see. We went through and did all that stuff. Well, let me, let me cease the recording that I'm on right now. when you can.",
