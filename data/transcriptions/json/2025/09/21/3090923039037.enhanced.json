    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I've got a quick question for you. This is Dave Hauser from Vortec Systems. I have techs across the country for one company. Do we have to – I just want to keep them. I just want to put them on there that they're on contract in the database. Do I need to open each position up, or can I put them all as one with a company, or how do I have to do that, Garrett? Okay, so for position record, if it's for this same position, let's say it's all for a cashier, then you can say number of openings is more than one. So you could say you have three openings for a cashier. But if it's separate positions, we would recommend making different position records underneath that. Yeah, they're all computer technicians, so they're just different locations across country but under one umbrella. So just open multiple positions is what I should do. Yeah, maybe since they're in different locations, I would make different positions so you could keep track of, you know, who is in the hiring process for this location, who's in the hiring process for this location. We hire them because they work for us. So we don't have to go through the regular recruiting, like getting approval or nothing. Oh, okay. So I was just trying to make it easier on myself. would you just open up with multiple positions? Would that be the best way to do it, just throw them in there? Yeah, I think that would be best. But, yeah, the other route would be to make one position with multiple openings. There's like a field called number of openings. Yeah, that's what I was going to do. Yeah, yeah. That would be the best way to do it then. Okay. Yeah, that'll work. If you're not hiring and doing the whole process for the hiring, it's just kind of for yourself. That makes sense. Yeah, they work for us. They're on contract with our client, but that's how we do the hiring. Gotcha. I guess it's more of a staffing model, whatever you want to refer to it as, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. I'll just do that. I appreciate it, Garrett. Thank you. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. All right. Bye. Bye.",
