And our users are noticing a big slowdown in PCR, and I just didn't know if there was a known issue or if it's us in particular. I haven't heard anything. You know, as I'm talking to you and I'm navigating, things are moving along quite normally now. All it took was for you to answer the phone. it's like taking your car to the mechanic it stops making that noise yeah it literally is navigating perfectly now and I waited like 20 minutes because I thought surely it's going to be okay it's going to come in back and it did it's just so what can happen especially if you have users that are making like a large move like moving a lot of names from like one roll up to another or doing like bulk moves or like bulk imports or exports that can slow it down a little bit. So just something to be aware of with that. But yeah, I just popped in and yeah, it's going, it's going good now. So, okay. Well, I just called to say hi. Well, we appreciate it. Okay. Thanks for your help. Have a great day. Bye.",
