    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by your name. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning, this is Jim Hi, this is Tia Hey, Tia, how are you? I'm good How about you? Not too bad, not too bad And is anyone else, I think there's two other people joining us today, is that so? Anne is, I just got off the phone with her I'm not sure if Maria is going to be able to make it Okay, no worries, no worries So we'll give Ann just a couple of minutes to get in here. And did you get my email? Did you have a chance to take a look at that video about the HireEasy integration? Yes, I did. Unfortunately, they don't give me a demo account, so I don't have any way to show it live. So that's why I wanted to make sure you had a chance to look at that to develop some questions and see if I could help because I don't have any way to actually show it. But I'll answer any questions that you have on that there. Yeah, I do have some questions. I think Anne has some questions too. So I guess the question for us is, yes, we have all these names in our database, right? Our industry is very niche, pretty much based on certain titles. I think when we have our assistant help pull up like roll up list for us, she's just putting in the name of the job, but sometimes we type bit differently. Like, so just for example, a director of nursing, we might type it in the PCR under title is BON, director of nursing. Sometimes we have positions called nurse consultant. Sometimes it gets typed in as nurse consultant. Sometimes it gets typed in as NC. Sometimes it It gets copied as Regional Nurse Consultant or RNC. So I'm not sure when those roll-ups are created, like how they're being pulled to give us a database of candidates. So I guess my question also is, if we are, so when we search for candidates on Indeed or on LinkedIn and we are able to add them to our database, I guess, is the HireEasy going to be able to help us pull more specific candidates already within the database, and how is it going to do that for us? Okay. Excellent. Excellent. So, um. Anne is on. Hey. Yeah. Good morning, Anne. Okay. Anne, did you hear me with the question? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, that was an excellent question. I'm going to share my screen just to hop in here. So you have a database that's already full. You're doing searches within the database. I believe what's going to happen, so as you're pulling people in from Indeed, are you using Capture by chance? Yes. Okay, so as you're pulling people in, I think to my understanding of the HireEZ, it should be able to do that, but I don't think it's automated. So what it will do is like when you have your record in PC Recruiter, you could, from their action menu, you can go ahead and say update via HireEasy. And if you click that update via HireEasy, that is going to go out and I believe find more information on that candidate. So it's going to go ahead and try and find additional numbers, additional emails, stuff like that. And then I think it even gives you a little option to click to update into PC Recruiter. To my knowledge, there's no way to do that en masse, so it's more of a one-off to do something like that. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure how that benefits to go through and find more names. I mean, you know, it's not like, you know, we have pretty much the same kind of keywords. so if we pull up somebody and let's say it's a director of nursing and then we're going to go hire easy and try to find more information about that person so essentially we might be able to get a phone number or an email address because the way that we do is we just call in directly we call directly and get the person on the phone yeah so i don't know that i'm just trying to figure out how this might benefit yeah i don't know that that would one that might the zoom info has a few more integration points into PC Recruiter it's more expensive but the zoom info offers one of these up here at the main in the main search that you can opt into zoom info clicking that will launch zoom info and then you can do a search and pull a group of records from zoom info into PC Recruiter so that's going to let you at least mass import like a list into PC Recruiter where if the higher easy doesn't so that might give you a little added help there to be able to search zoom info and pull it in that way that might be another suggestion to do that so I guess what is so what does I guess it's not confusing for me to understand what higher easy really does that to my knowledge what they are and I've never used them but what they are is they're a data enrichment tool so if you have a record you can go into higher easy and I can look up John adcox and I can try to find a mobile number for him a home email a second email something like that so if I understand it what they are is they're primarily just data enrichment so if you have a record you can kind of deep dive with that name through higher easy to find the deeper information there there's no mass import or anything like that and I don't think they work in large volume I think it's more of a one-off to find a little more information much like just Google searching them they probably have better ways to do that than Google searching but I think that's all that that pretty much does people use it interchangeably with zoom info and I know zoom info also zoom info is a good data source you can do a search and find people I think they also do data enrichment but zoom info does give you the ability to kind of just do a general search and pull people in onto a roll-up list. Where is it pulling the people from? Zoom and all over. LinkedIn, it does searches. They have a whole bunch of different sites that they search and areas that they search and different things of that nature. But I don't know exactly every place it searches from. But you're sure it searches? I mean, just it sounds like and it just doesn't sound like and please don't take this the wrong way. But I guess my concern would be is that you've never used hire easy. And I'm not sure, you know, we haven't either. So, you know, we're really looking to get an idea exactly how it works. Not, you know, kind of or the best of my knowledge, you know. And again, I'm not, please, I'm not. But do you know what I'm saying? Like, I don't know anything about it. And then you tell me you don't, you've never even used it. Oh, for sure. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I feel like a dipstick because I'm telling you all, I've never used it. And I never have. I don't know how, I think Tyler kicked you my way. And I was perplexed as to why he did because I don't train on it. I don't use it. I just mentioned it in the demo. That's really all that I have to do with it. Best that maybe I could do is see if anyone else on the support team, maybe the time I didn't know of, has ever used it. One of my guys, James, might have had some experience with it because he kind of leads up our integrations. So, I believe he's actually demoed it, worked with them, seen it used, anything like that. So, I might be able to talk to him, see if he might be able to provide any further info, be it a call or even just an email with kind of some bullet points of what it does. I mean, I guess we were going to do a demo through HireED directly, but then we're like, well, if it's already attached to PCR and we already use PCR, it would be nice to see the benefits of it already with our system and give us examples to see how it works. Sure. And I think usually when people consider HireEasy, they do demo through HireEasy because we are just essentially a plug-in to PC Recruiter. So I don't think it works any different. It's just going to work with your PC Recruiter data. But let me talk to James and see if he knows more about that because he actually has talked with them and worked with them to do the integration. He might know a little bit more specifics. And I apologize. I didn't think I would know a whole bunch because I don't. about it. And I'm sorry I couldn't provide more, but let me see if I can get more information from James. Well, hold on. Hold on one second. So I'm thinking maybe our best route right now would be to do a demo through HireEasy. And then, I mean, if it's integrated with PCR, then they should be able to, I think, at least give us some more insight of how it works together with PCR. I think we'll go that route first. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Yeah, that's what it is. If I find anything else, I'll pop you an email and let you know. But I'm sorry I couldn't be of more assistance there. All right. If you do find anything else out from that gentleman who did do the integration with them or he has any info or does have anything he can provide, yes, please let us know. Yeah, I'll pass it along. What I can find out from him, any specifics, tips, tricks, or further detail, I'll let you know. All right. Awesome. Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks, Jim. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
