    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah, my name is JP Wright. I use PCR for our contact management software, and I have some questions about the sequencing portion of PCR. Yeah. And I'm not sure who I need to talk to about this. Yeah, I can answer any questions that you have. okay so I know that we have it but we have to pay something to get it set up I guess the version of it that we pay for comes with it but we need something I guess we have to pay for something to turn it on technically you can just activate it and you can pay for like a couple hours of training for it more times than not okay and so yeah i i would just have to get you in touch with one of our account representatives and they'd be able to go through all that with you okay so i i guess i have a have a couple questions about how it works um like so i've been using source whale which is like similar to the sequencing, but it's, I guess it's kind of the same thing, but on steroids. So, like, some of the steps that you can set up in PCR, like, you guys also offer the option to, like, set up, like, LinkedIn, like, it'll prompt you to do, like, LinkedIn steps, like, to connect with people or send them messages. Yeah, what it'll do is those are, like, manual steps. We don't connect to LinkedIn. It's more of a reminder. If you have their LinkedIn profile already on the name record, it can help you jump to LinkedIn to perform that action. Okay. And, like, can you put in, like, the text of, like, say you have, like, a search that you're working on, and you have, like, a standard, like, LinkedIn intro that you're sending to people. Can you put that text in that step so you can just copy it from there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so in each of the manual steps there's like an instructions section and like a script section. Okay. So you can put any text in there to like if you were copying and pasting. Okay. So it's similar to that, to the way SourceWheel works. It just works directly from within PCR. Yep. And I know SourceWheel does offer an integration with PCRecruiter as well. Uh-huh. So if you're comfortable with that tool and you're already using it and you're already paying for it and you like that product, you can always reach out to them as well about that integration. They are an integration partner. I am using it, but I have a couple other people that work for me that I don't know that they'll use it enough to justify the cost. Yeah. So for some of the things that we're doing, I think it might be helpful to have some of the more – to ask them to do shit in SourceWale, they'll lose their minds. It'll just be too much for them to mess with. I'm wondering if trying it through PCR is a simpler step to start with. Yeah. We also offer a webinar on our Learning Center page. so if you go to learning.pcrecruiter.net we have a webinar section and the first webinar in there is actually on our sequencing feature and that's always we typically recommend people take a look at that before they start with sequencing just kind of grasp of what the tool can and can't do and just how it generally learning.pcr.net Learning.pcrecruiter.net pcrecruiter.net PC Recruiter 9 It'll be over where you see like home and those buttons over on the right you'll see where it says webinars. Oh, yeah, there you go. Webinars. Sequencing feature. Yeah, that's kind of broken down into four different sections. Okay. The first one kind of, the first section kind of just goes over sequencing in general. Okay. All right. Yeah, I'll look at those. I'm guessing that it works similar similar enough to source whale that I can kind of I know it's going to end up happening like I'm going to have to set up like the steps of the sequences for these guys and kind of guide them through using it so yeah well that's kind of with the like if you decide to activate the feature and get the training you can kind of break it it's typically two hours of training for sequencing the first hour is kind of just like the rough explanation in the admin training and like setting up the sequences and kind of going over what they can do and then the second part we can break down into okay this is the admin side of you've created a template how can you activate it for other users and then a smaller training with the rest of the team like, hey, this is the only stuff you have to worry about. You don't have to worry about the other building it part. That was going to be my next question was like, if I create a sequence in PCR, can everybody access it? Depending on their securities, yes. Because each sequence is tied to a roll-up list. Okay. So in order to run a sequence, the person has to be in a roll-up? Yes. Okay. And so let's say you create like a general template. Yep. That you want all your sequences to follow. Yep. You could activate that template multiple times and just you rename the name of the sequence and just pick a different roll-up list each time. Okay. So you could have Andy's roll-up lists have their own sequences, and Jen's roll-up lists have their own sequences. And that way they're focusing just, like, on their roll-ups. Yep. You can set it up like that. Gotcha. So, like, and you can, I assume, choose, like, how many steps you want in the sequence and adjust, like, you know, step one is an email. Step two is a LinkedIn connection request. Step three is a phone call. Yep. Yeah. Okay. And then do you use the RingCentral integration? We don't. We use the mobile phone integration. We do use the phone integration, but you have to have the PCR app open on your phone. And whenever you click the phone number, it opens up a dialer on your phone. Like it opens up your phone. I was just going to ask because with sequencing, there are some automatic steps that you can do in there with emails and text messages. but the automatic texting is only available with that ring central integration. Yeah. And that doesn't go through, that doesn't go through your actual phone number. Right. I assume that. Yeah. It'd be whatever your like ring central number is. Yeah. You can also. The outgoing calls, the outgoing calls are you guys able to change the outgoing call to look like it's coming from a cell phone? I know that's something that... Not with the RingCentral part. Because all we do with outgoing calls is when you do the click-to-dial, is we just pass that over to RingCentral. Gotcha. Now, since we have the other dialer set up, will it still work the same way? Will it... Should it pop open? For the calls, yes, with the click-to-dial, because there are click-to-dial steps. in there where you could just click the function, but you just have to manually how that call went. Whether it's voicemail, it does a certain thing. If you connect it, it does another thing. Yep. Yeah, the dialer stuff, I know from using Source Whale's dialer, their dialer actually like it clones your phone number so that whenever you're calling people, the outgoing number shows up as your whatever number you want it to be, like your cell phone number. But the dialer in and of itself has its own issues. For me, this is more about trying to get the sequence down so that, like, I'm guessing that you guys don't do much for like the wording of the sequencing either. Like SourceWale has, they call it like campaign AI, which you tell it what you want to do. Like if you're trying to do business development or if you're trying to, you know, find a candidate. Yeah, so we do have a couple templates that'll come preloaded. uh-huh um for you one for uh candidate engagement one for business development yep um but as far as like that where it like kind of helps you build it out we don't have anything like that gotcha well I can just cheat and use source whale to do it and copy the steps over just copy the text from the steps I'm assuming you can just change the text however you – or you just put the text in exactly how you want it anyway. Yeah. Yeah, because it runs off of – with the automatic emails, you just create a form letter that has that text. Yep. Now, whenever you create the sequence, does it create that form letter, or do you have to manually go in and create the form letter for each step of the sequence? So you have to create them, but you can either create them beforehand just in the form letter section, or you can build them like on the fly as you're building the sequence. Okay, like as you're building the sequence, it will put them in the form letter folder. Yeah, so like when you create an automatic email step, you have to choose a form letter. Okay. But it doesn't like automatically open the correct email. Like it just prompts you to do it, and then you do it. Correct. Okay. It'll let you select a pre-existing form letter or let you create one as you're like in that pick your form letters section. Okay. So, like, for example, like, if I have, like, say I have a roll-up and I put 50 people in that roll-up that I'm going to sequence, I'm going to run a sequence for them. And, like, if my first step is email, do you have to go through each person individually and handle that step, or does it automate some of it? Like, for, like, the email portion, is it automated? Yes, you have the option for automatic emails or manual emails. Okay. And then whenever you're sending out emails, like do you guys – I can't remember. whenever we set up PCR and the email function, outgoing emails go through your servers, right? No, they go through whatever email alias server you set up. Okay. So it's usually whoever your regular mail provider is. Gotcha. Okay. And we do offer a rate limiter within sequencing as well. Okay, so it'll send like so many emails a minute or... So it's per hour. Okay. But in your alias, there's like a, there's a send delay. Mm-hmm. So that's where you don't hit your like per minute. So like yours right now goes through your Office 365 server, but you have a two and a half second delay between each email send. Okay. So it wouldn't blast all 50 out at a time. It would send them. Yeah, it would wait that two and a half seconds, send the other. But then as soon as you hit that 50, like, per hour, it would say, hey, we're done sending for this hour. We can send 50 more next hour. Okay. For some reason, I seem to remember whenever Matt Mueller was there, I thought he told me that the emails went out through your servers. Because I was having an issue whenever I clicked emails, sending them out of PCR. If I sent someone a form letter, they were getting hung up in spam filters. And I thought I remembered him saying that way out of what's set up. You might have been set up before to use our servers, but we never recommend that. Okay. Because our server is like the piggyback for all, every single PC recruiter customer. That's why it was. And that's, we end up on a bunch of blacklists and spam with our, like that IP server range. So that's why we always recommend connect to your mail server. And not ours. Because that's, you're going to end up, if you use ours, you're more than likely going into someone's spam. Yeah. Okay. All right. Yeah, I could have sworn he had us set it up so that anytime we sent an email out of PCR, it was going through you guys. We just switched from Google to Microsoft for hosting our email, and I know that Robin ended up helping me update all of our email settings. and I don't remember how it was set up before. but I do know that anytime I send emails out of PCR it almost always felt like they were not being delivered that might have been when you were set up on our servers ours ours end up on so many different block lists you get people trying to skirt around their mail host list and send in thousands of bulk emails trying to use our servers instead of their own. And it's just no bueno. Yeah, that's part of why I like SourceWale because they manage email servers too. Yeah, they have their own dedicated bulk mailing servers. Yes, and they do what they need to do to make sure that if one ends up on a blacklist, they're moving stuff around, I'm sure. But they also, you know, they're also good at, you know, whenever you put things into a campaign, which they call a sequence a campaign. Whenever you put stuff into a campaign, like, they send out, like, one email every, like, two minutes. so like you'll have like an outbox that's queued up with you know maybe a couple hundred messages for the day so that you're not even sending like 50 an hour they're doing the slow trickle yeah yeah the much slower like there's yeah like if I look in my outbox I don't have anything in there for today but I know that like there's usually like every two minutes is when a message goes out okay so for the sequencing I just need you guys to turn it on and if I pay for like whenever I pay for it I'm actually I'm not paying to have you turn it on I'm paying for training to use the sequencing is that am I understanding that correctly yeah Yeah. So what I can do for that, it looks like your account rep is actually gone for the day. What I can do is get you over to your account rep, Jim Lombardo. Okay. And if you just, I can send you to his voicemail. Then he can give you a call back Monday, kind of discuss the ins and outs and how all that would work. Yep. and he can answer any kind of like the account questions with it for you. And kind of just go from there. Okay. Do you remember what the cost is to turn it on? Was it like 200 bucks or something? I don't know off the top of my head. Okay. Jim would have it. I spent time, I talked to him about it. So, I just don't remember what it was. Yeah, I'm not 100% sure either. They don't give us down at the support level all the prices and stuff a whole lot of the times. So, we usually just hear it in passing. Yeah. Okay. I did have a support question, but I forget what it was. I'm sure it'll come to me on this. That's a callback. Well, I certainly appreciate your time and your help. You definitely answered a lot of questions for me and I feel like I have an idea how yours works. Um, yeah, I guess my main concern about using the PCR sequencing would be ending up with, uh, our email on a, on a spam list. yeah so what that's coming out a lot of what a lot of customers have done is like source oil there are dedicated like bulk mailing services such as like send grid where they'll sign up for those and we can set up an alias using the send grid servers in your pcr like alias and then all their sequences run through their send grid server okay just so that way they can use their regular email and PC recruiter for like the onesie twosies but anything that's going out in bulk is hitting the SendGrid server not the Office 365 server okay I haven't even looked into that I have no clue SendGrid They're a little bit of a pain in the butt support-wise with SendGrid, but they're really easy to set up an alias inside of PC Recruiter. And their plans are a relatively decent price for the market when it comes to bulk mailing. Okay. I don't even know. Do they base it on how many emails a month you send? yeah so like they have a free option but you can only send up to like a hundred emails per day with it across your entire organization um but then i think they have like a 10 000 email plan like where combined you guys can send out 10 000 emails a month through their servers and then they have some like more extensive plans if you were hitting that 10,000 email cap. Gotcha. Yeah, I mean, it looks like it's 20 bucks for 50,000 to 100. And then the next step from there is 100,000 to 2.5 million a month. And that's 90 bucks a month. Yeah. I said most people go with a $20 one. Yeah. Okay. Alright. One last question. If I decide we want to use sequencing, like if I have like 200 people in a roll-up and I choose, like I only want to send a sequence to like 50 of those people? Like, do I have to create a separate roll-up of just the 50 I want to send? Yes. Or can you, once you, okay. Yeah, anytime you start a sequence, whoever's in that roll-up list will be added to the sequence. Gotcha, okay. Okay. Okay. alrighty so do you want to send him Jim's voicemail so he can give you a call back you know what I sent I sent him an email earlier in the day so I hadn't heard back from him so I figured I'd call so I assume I'll just hear from him when he gets in next week yeah I think he was out early today I think he had like a function for his kid at school It's fine. No explanation needed. This isn't something that's super important. I get it. Well, I certainly appreciate your help today. Not a problem. Like I said, if you have any other questions or if you remember that support question, feel free to give us a call. Yeah, I will. Thank you. Have yourself a great rest of the day. Yeah, you too. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.",
