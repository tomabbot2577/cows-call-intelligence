    "text": " Thanks for calling Main Secret Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Chris Wiseman at MedBest. We are experiencing system slowness in the MedBest recruiting database. Let me pop in and take a look here. So we haven't had any other reports of slowness. Yes, other users are experiencing slowness. including myself is it when you're doing anything in particular in the database just everything it's just slow with everything everything you click on is slow oh yeah i'm seeing that on my end with you here too now you don't have a user that's doing like a large import or anything do you Nope. Okay. Not that I'm aware of. The only person that would be is Nadia, and I can text her right now. But I'm going to say it's safe to assume no. I'm not aware of any imports that are happening right now. Let me log out and back in again because it just started working quicker for me here. Can you log out and back into the database for me? Sure. Let's see if it's working a little faster. There might have just been a little hiccup on one of the servers. no no no it's falling down again oh no there it goes i'm sending a message out to the team as well i mean it's it's not snappy like it should be Yeah, I'm noticing a little bit of lag. And it's not importing anything either, so it's 100% confirmed there's no imports going on. Okay. Let me get your information down here so I can give you a call back. I'm going to have to have a tech investigate this a little bit further on the server side. What's a good number I could reach back out to? It is 727-977-9216. Perfect. All right. Let me investigate this a little bit, and then I'll give you a call back as soon as I have an answer for you. Okay, cool. And your name is Tyler? Yes. Okay, cool. Thanks, Tyler. Yep, not a problem. Talk to you soon. Yep, bye.",
