    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Thank you. I've got a quick question for you. Jeremy, the other guy who works with me, he's trying to set up his RingCentral to ring, to show his color ID. He uses a soft phone with RingCentral, and he's logged in with Chrome, but it's not showing any color ID popping up on his screen. Does he have to do something else to get that to trigger? Garrett, I thought we had to do something. I just can't remember what it was. So I just want to make sure that the Java and Launcher are running correctly on the computers. So can you hold on? Can I get him on the phone for us real quick? Sure, yeah. I think I was just talking to him, but he insisted on using Firefox, which is one of the ones. Yeah, I told him to use Chrome. He said he switched to Chrome, but he didn't see a difference. Is there a Launcher or something, or what's the deal there? Yeah, so Java and Launcher has to be installed and running on the computer. But, yeah, I could walk through that setup if that's helpful. Let me see if I can get him on the phone. Hold on. Sure. Hey. Hey, Jeremy, I got Garrett from PC Recruiter on the phone with us. Okay. He said you have to install the Java thing. What is it, Garrett? Can you tell him? Yeah. For pop-ups and things like RingCentral to work, Java and Launcher do have to be installed on the computer. We can do – I can walk you through a test to see if that's already installed, if that does sound familiar. If not, I can walk you through installing both of those pieces. We're both PC technicians. I know what Java is. Okay, cool. Do you have the PCR Launcher installed as well? Yep. Okay, awesome. So then if you go to the lightning bolt at the top right of PCR and select name from the drop down. I'm actually checking to see if I have Java in the computer first here. Oh, okay. Which I might not. I don't know why I would. Okay, gotcha. Is there a specific version that you need? Just the latest version of Java works. I still don't make it pretty. Where the heck is it? button. Oh goodness, where's the download button on the website? I thought it's actually on there, is it on your website, Garrett? I thought for Java you would just go to java.com and download Java for desktops button. Yeah, I went right past that and it took me to another page. So here's the download and there's no download button. I see download for Java for desktops right here on java.com. Yeah, if you click that, it'll go to another page with the same button. Yeah, I already had it in there. It's just updating it. Okay, that's good. Is there something else that needs on there too, Garrett? Yeah, once that's up and running, the Java, then we'll get the PCR launcher installed. It's on and already turned on. Do you have to restart it, Garrett? Do you have to restart it or anything? They're both already installed. Okay. Okay, so then, yeah, if you just want to go to your PCR and then go to the lightning bolt at the top right of PCR and select name. Okay. And then go to parse from resume and hit start. That should have a pop-up appear called the add resume utility. Use it every single day, yep. Okay, good. Awesome. So that's a great way to test to see if Java and Launcher are running currently. Next we'll take a look at the notifications For Google Chrome So if you just want to go to the three dots At the top right of the browser I don't use Google Chrome Actually had it turned on in Google's Chrome It didn't do anything I guess I'll try it again It works on mine though Okay So let me open it up in Chrome here Alright PC recruiter login I thought you had to do something with RingCentral2Garrett on that end Is that right? to make sure it's working? The central . Yeah, as long as you're connected. I logged into Jeremy's username and it looks like the status is in green connected. So it's not a Okay, that's good. Okay. It might just be that there's a notification being blocked in the browser. Next thing we'll check for troubleshooting. Why does it work with Firefox anyway, Garrett? What's the deal with that? That's just not one of the browsers that we support. We don't code or design for it, so the developers recommend using either Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Ooh, I don't like Edge either. I don't like either one of them. I always used Chrome, but I just never did like Edge. I used to use Firefox years ago, but, man, I haven't used it for so long. Yeah. Okay, logged in. Awesome. So just click the three dots at the top right of your browser, and we'll go to Settings towards the bottom. I have Customize. Customize Settings is all the way down at the bottom, I think, Jeremy, where the three dots on Google Chrome. Oh, three dots on Google Chrome? Yes. Yeah, top right. There you go. All right. Yeah, once you get to settings at the bottom there, then go to privacy and security on the left. Okay. And then site settings on the right. Okay. And then look for notifications under the permissions heading. Okay, got it. Is this first year where it says default behaviors that sites can ask to send notifications? Is that turned on? Or is that below? Sites can ask to send notifications, collapse all requests on the address bar. Yep. Okay, excellent. And then down below, is there PC Recruiter, is that added to the list of once they're allowed to send notifications? No. Oh, okay. Yeah, if you just want to add in the address, it's www.pcrecruiter.net. Okay, awesome. So that may help. And then, yeah, why don't we test that? Maybe that was the issue. So if we go to PCR, is there any way we can test? test. Maybe somebody do a call in to you. Yeah, here I'll test my Google number with it. There you go. Excellent. It should be a PC recruiter. She gives you, she gives you a pop-up screen down at the bottom of your Let's see. Toolbar there. 673. What is my number? 8873. Unknown. Unknown. So is that known? No. For sure. PCR logo next to that pop-up where it says unknown, Or is it a separate kind of pop-up outside of PCR? Are you seeing unknown, like, on the screen as a pop-up? Oh, I think we might have lost him there. Are you still there? Deletion, Jeremy. Yeah, he might have been hanging up the Google phone call and might have exited this one or something. Let me try it one more time. Hold on. All right. you know like it always does somebody pops up like your name will pop up say dave calling or Uh-huh. to see if notifications are enabled for Google Chrome. So if you just want to go to your search bar at the bottom. So it's going to pop open in Google Chrome somewhere? Yeah, it's kind of like a little Chrome. Truly, guys, it's kind of getting stressful to me, and I've just been copying and pasting in PCR for four years now, and it works for me. I think I just want to do that. I'm tired of messing with it. I've been messing with it for two days now. I really don't want to worry about it. I really don't. okay that's fine so sorry sorry for uh for getting you on the phone and everything but yeah i'm just kind of over it all right appreciate it thanks for your help garrett all right reach out if you need anything a lot that's it thanks man bye",
