    "text": " Carol, and I'm away from my phone right now, so please leave a message, and I'll call you back as soon as possible. Thanks so much, and have a great day. Hi, Carol. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. Wanted to give you a quick call just to follow up with you to check in. Got your voicemail the other day. It said you're looking to cancel your PC Recruiter account because you're retiring. I just wanted to check in to see if you needed the data returned on that. So just wanted to check on that again. Do you need a data return? It's $175, and then we will get the data to you in a downloadable format. You can take it with you or sell it to someone or give it to someone or keep it or not. So, again, just checking on that. And also kind of see it looks like you're looking to get a close look at that ticket in queue. If you want to give me a quick call, let me know if you want that data return. I can update that in the ticket as well. I'm going to make it yes for now, but we can change it. and then if there's anything you should need, let me know, 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. And like I said, I'll put that ticket in. They'll be in touch. My accounting team will be in touch as to next steps in getting the account closed. Thanks very much. Carol, talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
