    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, Chrissy. How are you? Jim, can you hear me okay? I do. Do you hear me okay? I can. I can hear you. Excellent. Doing okay. How are you? I'm pretty well. I am pretty well. I am just kind of waiting on Jason here. Thanks for getting us in today and getting everything started. And your data is all moved in from Mike, right? That's correct. Yes. Awesome. So what we're going to do today, we're going to go through and kind of take a look at just a few questions with Jason. Jason is going to be your trainer. He's going to get you trained up on PCRecruiter and he is going to be the one who will get a couple of calls. I think he usually schedules a couple or three calls on this first initial consulting call. So we'll do that at the conclusion of the call. You would, if you ever need to add users or drop users or if there's anything you need that you don't know who to come to, come find me. I'm for adding, dropping users, upgrades, downgrades, anything like that. You can always reach to me as an account manager as well. And then Jason's going to get you trained and he'll be the one for how-tos and stuff like that. So I will turn the call over now to Jason to go through the few questions he has, get a little information from you, and then he'll get some initial calls scheduled for you in the coming week to two. Okay, thank you. Awesome. Hi, Chrissy. Like Jim said, I'm going to be your PCR trainer. The questions I have today are going to kind of just help guide what our training process is going to look like, just to provide some context to me. So the first question I have is going to be what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing, like permanent placement, contract placing, Like, what are you thinking? I only do permanent placement. Okay, perfect. And do you have a specific niche or industry you're working in? I work primarily in engineering. Engineering, okay. And have you worked as a recruiter before? 25 years. Oh, heck yeah. Okay. Within the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? No, I'm not anticipating it, but it could happen. So I'll definitely let you guys know if it does. Perfect. Okay. Who am I going to answer? I imagine you've worked with a CRM or an ATS before. So like which ones have you used before? I've actually used PCR before. Oh, perfect. I've used PCR and Crelate and a lot of other ones during my time in corporate. But primarily in the last 15 years in my own company, I've used PCR or Crelate. create or nothing just i'm a horrible save all the resumes in my in my emails and uh so but okay okay awesome um so this next one's going to kind of relate to the speed at which we go through our training sessions um hold on one second let me check how many hours uh okay so you have 10 hours of training. And each training session is traditionally an hour long. We have a fast, moderate, or a slow speed. Fast being three a week, moderate being two, and slow being one. How do you feel you'd like those to go? Is it, are you able to adjust that or is it one forever? You can change it whenever you like. Okay. I'm going to start with one. and we just FYI my husband and I were out of town last week it was our 25th wedding anniversary but we had an emergency earlier today and I'm so sorry that's why I rescheduled so I'm not sure what my schedule will be like for the next couple weeks but I can I can let you know. And I'll know more after, I'll know more in a couple of hours, but I appreciate your flexibility and I'm really sorry. Yeah, you do not need to apologize. I'm as flexible as you need me to be. If you ever need to move something around or reschedule, just let me know and I'll absolutely work with you. No issues, no concern. Chrissy, I have a question for you. Chrissy, when was your 25th anniversary? What day? Monday, the 16th. Oh, Monday, June 10th was my 25th wedding anniversary. No way. We're so close there, Jim. I mean, we didn't have a long call, right? Yeah. You said last week. I'm like, last week? I was just a week or so ago. I was a week or so ago. Well, congratulations, right? And congrats to you as well. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Okay. So, Chrissy, what operating system are you using? Is it like a Microsoft? Is it a Mac computer? It's a Windows HP. Windows? Yeah, it's a Microsoft Windows HP. Okay. Which browser are you currently using, like Chrome, Edge? I primarily use Chrome. I did have Canary for a long time, Canary on the Chrome, but I think right now I just have regular Chrome. Okay, perfect. And your email provider, is it Microsoft? Is it Gmail? It's Microsoft Office 365. Okay, perfect. And I was specific because sometimes that's a little bit different than just regular out. Yeah. Okay, a few more I got to answer. So I imagine you have some resumes that you want to import. Is that correct? Yes, I'm laughing because when I originally, when I first started using PC Recruiter, there was a tool called a suite or something like that where it could bring like all the resumes from the computer into the system. Yeah. And I'm really, I'm not very organized in my technology. So I clicked that button and it was bringing every document into the recruiter originally. And I don't think I told Jim this. He was my friend back then. I literally had to delete all of the information in the whole PC recruiter and start over. Oh, geez. Because I was like, what have I done? And so anyway, yeah, I have some resumes I'll probably want to import. Okay. Perfect. That resume inhaler might still work too, the inhaler for the mask. The inhaler, that's what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a nice piece. Makes it easy. Yeah, it's super easy to use. So the best way to probably go about that, Chrissy, is if you could try your best to get your resumes organized into one folder, That's probably going to be the easiest and cleanest way to handle it. And we'll make sure that it's linked up properly and that we're not accidentally pulling in anything we don't want. Okay. So what else do we need? Are you planning on having a website? And if so, is your website ready? It's live. It's ready. It's been up for a long time. but I don't really use it for recruiting. I may at some point in the future, but well, it's more of a business card than it is. I don't have people apply to it, but I may change that in the future. Okay. If you ever want to change that, let me know. I imagine it would be just a relatively simple process. But yeah, if you ever want to change that, let me know and we'll jump on that. Okay. So this last question, it's just kind of going to give me an idea on how to guide through the software and what things we want to make sure we put extra focus on and what things we just want to touch on. In terms of your communication style, how do you feel about automation versus like a more manual approach? Automation being things like I do something in the database so it sends an email, things like that? That's a really great question. And I sort of have a love-hate relationship with both. Right. In a perfect world for me, I would be able to have some templates in the database that I could send, but maybe they didn't send automatically because mostly I use the database for myself. Like my clients don't log into it. Other people don't log into it. So I'd like to be more automated at some point, but even if I could just learn how to put the templates in there so I could easily tell someone they're not moving forward in the process or something like that. Yeah, absolutely. All the text messages and emails and phone calls I get from, you know, 15, 20 candidates in a process. And then I hide under my desk. And I don't reply to anybody. Right. Yeah, we absolutely can make sure we hit on those things. No issue with that whatsoever. And I think that is everything I have for this form. So usually how I like to handle my training sessions is I like to choose a specific day and a specific time. And we just say that's our time and that's when we're going to meet. Again, that time is very flexible. It can move whenever you need it to. If you think you're going to miss a meeting, just shoot me an email and we'll reschedule it. So I want to emphasize that we're very flexible about that. But how does doing something like that sound to you? Or do you want to just schedule something and then on the end of that call, we'll schedule the next? Like what kind of approach do you want to handle? um in this season of my life jason in theory that works perfectly choosing one day and putting it at a set time um but but with some personal things if if i could have some flexibility i i would appreciate that yeah entirely one we can pick a certain day and time And I forget you guys are in Eastern time because when I was saying three o'clock and then you were like, you guys are like, no, four o'clock. I was like, oh, that's three o'clock for me. I'm in Central time. And I was like, oh, we're saying the same thing. So I forget about that, but I think probably that the best day would be on Fridays because I really try to not schedule interviews and meetings on a Friday so that I can do administrative and catch-up type work. So if a Friday would be amenable to you, we could try that. Why don't we say, how would tomorrow at the same time, so three you, four me, how would that work for you? Or do you want to push into next week? Could we please start next week? Like I said, I'll know more in a couple of hours, but right now I am. Right, right. if that's okay. Yeah, absolutely. How would that time work next Friday? Well, we're closed on the 4th, aren't we? How would... Would it be possible to squeeze in a Wednesday for next week? Hold on just a second. Yeah, Wednesday. Hold on one other second. I think Wednesday could be fine. Let me look at Wednesday. That's the second. Yes, that's the second. Yeah, Wednesday would work anytime after 3 o'clock Eastern time. Okay. Okay. Why don't we, yeah, let's do the second. Could we do at 3 o'clock? Would that be, give you enough room? Yes, that would be fine. Okay. Okay. So just to kind of gear you up what that first training session looks like, it is fairly administrative. We have to connect your email, create a user, all of that fun stuff. So just kind of be geared up for that first one to be a little administratively focused. But once we get to that second session, we're going to dive into the core material. And being that you've used PC Recruiter before, we'll probably be able to scooch through it relatively quickly. But I think that's everything that I need. Do you have any specific questions for me at this point, Chrissy? No, the really, really only thing that might be helpful for me is if you have some videos or something, something that I could just watch, take a look at, not study or anything, but just familiarize my, I haven't logged in yet, but just familiarize myself. I know the technology has changed a little bit. I was just a user in 2021, maybe, 2020, 2021. But if I could just familiarize myself with, like, see some of the capabilities, something that you would send to someone that you're trying to sell the product to, that can help me know what questions to ask and what the capabilities are that might be good for someone like me. Okay, perfect. Does that make sense? Yeah, no, I get what you're looking for. I will, I'll dig through some stuff that I have and I'll see if Jim has any kind of videos that might be helpful with kind of the, the, the, what you were saying about having a perspective of selling it to people. I'll see if Jim has anything. Even just one, like something that you guys let, you know, like you can push play on a demo or something like that. Even something like that, that I could just watch. Nothing crazy or special or just. Right. A use. I got you. Okay. I'll do some digging and I'll try and get you an email sent out before the end of the day today. But yeah, that's everything that I need. Jim, do you have any questions, anything? No, no, I am all good. I'm all good. Okay, perfect. Then Chrissy, I'll send out a meeting for the second and I will see you then. Thank you both so much. And again, I appreciate your willingness to accommodate me today. Happy anniversary, Jim. Jason, pleasure meeting you. And thank you both so much. Absolutely. Thanks so much. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
