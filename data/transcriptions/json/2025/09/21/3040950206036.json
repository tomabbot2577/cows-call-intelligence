    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. I was trying to get tech support. My PCR email deleting, trying to delete emails is not occurring. And then when I try to apply to an email. Oh, okay. You probably just need to, what is your name? Probably just need to clear cache on your browser. Yeah, I did that already. Brian Spaulding. okay are you using chrome or edge edge okay um it's a little bit different let's see might just be the all-time let me open up edge i'm so used to chrome i could walk you through like in a second yeah i was using chrome but then like maybe two two and a half months ago well maybe longer than that i switched to edge um actually it was january i think i switched to edge that I would use, but this is the first time I've had this issue. Okay. With Edge. Yeah, so if you go into Edge, yeah, both of them basically, if there's things that kind of change, sometimes even just restarting your computer would have done it, but we'll see. Okay, go to the three horizontal dots at the top right of Edge and go down to delete browsing data. Don't get too alarmed yet, though. Where it says time range, Make sure it says all time. All time. Okay. Clear now. No. Uncheck browsing history. Download. Leave only cached images and files. I just need you to clear cache, but it's got to be all time. Okay. Okay. Then hit clear now. Yep. Then you'll want to completely close your browser. Okay. And then go back into Peace Recruiter, and it should work now. Okay. Your browser, was there anything here I needed? Not that I can get back, don't have to get back to. Okay. There's no, come on. No. coming up so I can log in Okay. Yep. That's fixed it. All right. And you might have just had like such like one last hour, which doesn't always. That's what it was on actually. Yeah. You want to make sure it's on all time. All right. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Bye-bye. You too. Bye.",
