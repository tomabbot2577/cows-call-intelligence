    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm calling because my – oh, shit, what's it called? The click to add button on LinkedIn isn't working? Yeah. Oh, it's not working? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, we'll run through some troubleshooting steps. First, if you go to the top right of your browser, Are you seeing the little capture tool icon up there at the top right? No, you know what? I'm not, and I don't know why. Normally it's there. Do you have an icon that looks like a puzzle piece in white that when you hover over it, it'll say extensions at the top right? No. Which browser are you using? Is it a Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome? I am using, I believe, Edge, but let me confirm. Yeah, it's Edge. Okay. So at the top right of edge, it might look like a cookie with a piece bitten out of it or it's like a puzzle piece. It should be at the top right there. Yeah, I know. I feel like I know what you're talking about. I remember seeing it in there in the past. Like I see my picture. There's a star to the left with favorites. There's three dots. and then there's this multi-colored like co-pilot that's okay that feels like it's new okay um let's jump on a screen share then i can see your what you're looking at a little bit yeah cool that makes sense uh so go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com Okay, let me know when you have the ID number. All right, that's firing up right now. One second. Okay, there we go. Going a little slow today. Sorry. Here's the meeting ID number. It is 933-684-573. 57 what was that 573 sorry 573 no that's okay okay great okay perfect if it asks about joining the audio by the computer is that okay or does you want me to continue without. Yeah, you can continue without and we'll just stay on the phone if that works for you. Yeah, cool. That makes sense. It does. Yep, I'm here. Okay, cool. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. All right, that's loading. Perfect. I can see that. All right, yeah, so it is missing that That button we're looking for. All right, so down at the bottom of your screen, there's all the icons of what's open. Click on the Microsoft Edge icon. It looks like a blue wave. Perfect. Yep. All right, and then at the top, right-click on the three dots. Okay. and then go to extensions okay there we go customize your browser with extensions okay so it doesn't look like you have it installed on this browser so we can install the capture tool for you that's really weird I've had it installed forever I was traveling last week I don't know yeah maybe Yeah, something happened with it last week because I don't remember this little rainbow color thing, the co-pilot being on there. I don't know how that happened. Maybe I clicked a button by accident. I don't know. But, yeah, just okay. So manage extensions? We'll actually go to a new tab and go to learning.pcrecruiter.net. Yeah, learning.pcrecruiter.net, that'll take you to our learning center. Perfect. And in the center, underneath that search bar, it'll say additional tools. If you scroll down, yeah, there you go. click on additional tools and then scroll down again and click on PCR capture on the left and we want to open the first article listed that says PCR capture setup perfect all right and then scroll down below the video there's like a step one that's under line there you download the PCR capture extension here And at the top, click on the blue Get Extension and Allow. Add Extension. There we go. Okay. Oh, bada-da. That just went away. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so now it's up there at the top right, and we'll get you signed in. So you just click on that. I guess we'll make sure it's pinned as well. So click on the puzzle piece or the cookie kind of icon. Extensions. Okay. Yeah, exactly. And then just click the pin to the right. And that'll pin that. There you go. Cool. And then you can click on the PCR logo and it'll ask you for your PCR web address up at the top right there. Oh, it's already logged in. Looks like I'm logged in. Which is strange. If you were installing it, you would think you need to log in again. So, yeah, something strange must have happened on a Microsoft Edge update. Yeah, OK. Yeah, go ahead and refresh any LinkedIn page and it should pop up after you refresh. there we go there we go but yeah beautiful easy enough so garrett is this the easiest way let me explain kind of a little bit um because i've been i've been somewhat customizing pcr to to function the way it does in recruiting in my other business so but in my other business i do a lot of events and I meet a lot of people. And so I'll make note of them in my phone as I'm meeting them and then come back in when I'm back in the office, kind of catching up on administrative functions. Is it easiest if I do it this way one by one? Like here's just one of the people that I met. So I'll go in there and I'll obviously make sure that I code it properly and enter it. But there's not an easier way to do it, is there? or a market? No, not really. We don't have any bulk uploading tools when it comes to LinkedIn. Their policies kind of prohibit that where you're doing bulk. So it's still definitely manual one by one on each profile. But we have seen customers, if they pay for a Zoom info account or the other one. Okay, yeah, ZoomInfo and HireEasy. Those accounts or those companies have built their own integrations for PCR where you can export a list of names in bulk from ZoomInfo over to PCR or HireEasy over to PCR. So that might be if you want to do some bulk moving over. that is an integration that they've built. So yeah, if you do have Zoom Info, maybe check with them if you have a representative there or their support team and ask about the PCR integration that they built to export. Okay, I certainly will. There was another question that popped into my mind. Oh, Supernormal AI. You know how there's like a note taker when you're on these calls or these Zooms or whatever? Is there a way to have that automatically input into PCR or do I just copy paste? So far, it's only really copy paste. We do have there was one company that built an integration here. yeah they're called quill uh q uh q u i l and they are an ai note taker that monitor calls um and they will automatically upload the notes uh or to the activities um or notes on a on a record um doing a summary of that really so they yeah they were the one that set forward and kind of built one for PCR specifically. But we do have a lot of customers ask about various other tools. There's nothing that we've built yet, but Quill is one to look into possibly. Okay. I most certainly will. And, okay, no, that's perfect. That'll actually – I'll look into that because that would be a big help. Awesome. Yeah. Let me see. I could just email you a real quick link to what we have about Quill. Oh, sweet. and just let us know if you have any questions. Oh, you know what? I do have another question. It's kind of an important one. Sure. I continue to get emails from you guys telling me that my account is overdue. But number one, I made a payment. Number two, I feel like I'm on auto payment. Can you check into that? Oh, I would have to transfer you over to our billing department and they can let you know what the status is there. Let me see if someone's available. Actually, before I let you go, what's your best email address? So I could send you the information. No problem. It's mbalagna at trustedhc.com. okay awesome i will send that to you but let me uh see if somebody from billing is available one second awesome thanks garrett no problem no problem okay it went right to voicemail they might be gone for the day um let me i'll transfer you over to that voicemail for billing and um somebody will be back to you as soon as possible and i'll also leave it perfect i'll leave it Perfect. Awesome. Okay, good. Perfect. Thanks, Garrett. Have a great afternoon. No problem. Thank you. You as well. Thanks so much. Okay.",
