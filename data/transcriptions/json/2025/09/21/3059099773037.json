    "text": " This is Renee. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I've received a voicemail that you're having trouble in PCR. Yeah, well, I wouldn't say I was having problems. I can't seem to figure something out. I sometimes schedule emails to go out to candidates. Like I have it saved in my candidate feedback, and I scheduled it to go out tomorrow. I can't seem to find it to delete it. Oh, okay. So if you are looking at your PCR screen, at the top right by your profile picture is a gear icon. That'll open a little drop-down menu. Click on background tasks. Okay. and um on the left it'll say queued or completed you want to go to your queued campaigns and then you can cancel a task all the way to the right of that perfect so it says it says it's waiting okay perfect thank you yeah no problem anything else you've been uh having trouble with okay cool we'll reach out if you need anything i mean i i was looking for it under like the email stuff and I couldn't find it. Oh, yeah. It's hiding in this background tasks area, but you can cancel email campaigns at any time here. And if you go to complete it on the left, you can take a look at how those have performed, if they actually sent to the person or not. So that's the background tasks area. You ever need to use it? Perfect. I appreciate it. I will share this with Rich. I had asked him and he didn't know. So thank you. I appreciate it. Okay. Yeah, no problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",
