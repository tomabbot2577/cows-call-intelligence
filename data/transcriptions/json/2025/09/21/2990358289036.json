    "text": "You're expected. Hello, Javier. Yeah, how's this? This is Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Well, how are you doing, Jim? Long time no talk. I know, yeah. I wanted to give a call. I got your ticket here, and I saw you were communicating with my team, and I just wanted to kind of circle back and see if there was anything that you needed out of me or if you did have any questions on that sequencing or anything of that nature. No, I really, I just say I've been a bit frustrated with the whole thing because the reality is that we invested a lot of money and for some reason and, you know, I end up using a lot of tools that are not necessarily, I don't say PCR. I saw that you were using Dripify, which actually our sequencing would do that. Yeah, so the sequencing, at first I saw that we had a, what do you call it, the sequencing included, but apparently not. Yeah, you're on a package. Let me look at your agreement here. because you were on sort of a premium sort of package, but it might have been before the sequencing happened. Let's see what you have here. I don't know what I'm paying. Right now I know that I'm not necessarily using the tool the way I want. I just see that I invested. I got it in the tool back again. When I left Management Recruiters, I didn't have the tool. I was using Google and Driver, and then I started to scale up, and I ended up talking to Tino. Tino helped with establishing everything, and I had a person in operation who invested a lot of money, but not going anywhere. Now I am using Dripify. I'm like, how do I use the sequencing that Tino told me how to use? And now I need to pay extra. I'm like, oh, whatever. I don't even know. The good news is for that, the sequencing wouldn't be any extra monthly, so it would not increase your monthly at all. And I could even do you a deal if you were ever interested in adding it. Normally it's $250 one time to add it. It adds it on. It gets you a couple hours. So I think I did pay that $250 because I do have sequencing. I have access to sequencing. So once they told me that I don't have access to sequence, and the training was given to me by Kino, but then Kino, you know, every time there was a sequence, there were like four roll-ups. And so I had the AI, my operation person do it. And long story short, it doesn't seem to, you know, I'm not getting any traction. you know when things things like this happen i i just i blame myself you know another day i have no one else to blame but that's where i am right now i i just have to let go one of my consultants because they were not uh invoicing and i'm paying her so it's me and another consultant which is in contingency i'll pay her tools for the mean and i i just wanted to understand the better use for for the sequencing and I'm afraid after when I wrote you then I found all the videos and so I'm I'm there watching the videos but they obviously when they say that there's another package I was like whatever so I don't know where we stand there yes if you have the sequencing you have the packet oh and it yeah I see back here enable sequencing that happened back in October of 2023 so it It looks like you do have the sequencing. So you have that. So there wouldn't be anything more that you need should you just wish to use the sequencing. Just if you needed. See, just an understanding. For some reason, Tina told us to use the sequencing on a, we have like every time I open a sequence, it's four roll-ups. And I'm like, that cannot be it, you know, because right now in Dripify, I use it super simple. So I wanted to see how I can. So just if I want training, just go into the videos and learn from it. I was going to say, do you want me to throw a ticket in, have one of our team give you a call to answer some questions about the sequence thing, help you around it for a little bit? The thing is that I don't even know what questions I need to ask. So I may, maybe I know if, are you going to charge me for that or what was the deal? I would put it no charge. So normally they would sell a whole proper hour, but I'll just put in the ticket, have them give you a call and answer some questions. Meanwhile, maybe I could send you a video about it, just so you can take a look at the videos and see what it does. No, no, I know what it does. The thing is that when Tino taught us to use it, I had an operation person doing the sequence, and she was doing four wallops for each sequence, you know, and I just didn't get it. And now I got into it, and I see that you can plug in RingCentral, ring central which I cannot use because the air goes on from Puerto Rico and there's a bunch of other ways to use this I guess I need to dive in into the tool to see if it's something that we could use more efficiently I understand that better but the way you know thought of I don't understand every time we need to have a sequence we need to open for all of them I'm from the little bit that I got it it's not necessary like that so I'm not sure why the arrows for all of for each sequence. Let me put in a ticket. Let me put in a ticket if someone on my support team call you no cost, just to go through kind of some basics of it with you, answer some questions. They can maybe hopefully point you in the right direction for no additional cost to do that because you already have it so there's not great needed at all. If that's okay? Perfect. No cost, I definitely can spend the time to see how we can use the tool better and leverage all these other tools that are there. I got a huge database, but I really don't know. I know I'm not maximizing it right now. And before we change to PCR, you know, we had this other tool that's called CATS, which had more tractions in the, from when we posted the positions. You know, we post a position and we have more traction. Right now, we got very little tractions on the job posting. That probably changed with a lot of the vendors like Indeed, Monster. They wanted to make some money. So now, Indeed, the only way you get some traction is for them to pay them additional money. So I'm not sure how that's working with other users of PCR in terms of posting those positions or if you have any particular partnerships that can help, you know, those positions get more traction out there. I'm not sure. Or what are you getting from the field, you know, from your users right now? I don't talk to people really that much, and I'm in sales, so I kind of talk to people initially. I don't talk with much support or anything, but I think a lot of people just Indeed is the big thing that most people are using to post to. And they just pay extra to Indeed, you know. Yeah, it paid you indeed. All right. All right. Anyway, yeah, sure, throw in a ticket. I'll be in the lookout for the call. Yeah, at least they can reach out and kind of offer you some assistance there and kind of take it from there. Okay, perfect. You have a good day. Thank you for calling, Jim, and nice talking to you again. It's been a very long time. My pleasure. My pleasure. Good to talk to you. You take care. Hopefully we can get you turned around here a bit. You take care. Bye-bye. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

00:00:06,937\nThis is Jim with PC Recruiter.\n\n5\n00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:07,520\nHow are you?\n\n6\n00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,816\nWell, how are you doing, Jim?\n\n7\n00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,140\nLong time no talk.\n\n8\n00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:12,218\nI know, yeah.\n\n9\n00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,180\nI wanted to give a call.\n\n10\n00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,602\nI got your ticket here,\n\n11\n00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:17,668\nand I saw you were communicating with my team,\n\n12\n00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:20,593\nand I just wanted to kind of circle back and see if there was anything that you\n\n13\n00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,698\nneeded out of me or if you did have any questions on that sequencing or anything of\n\n14\n00:00:23,738 --> 00:00:24,179\nthat nature.\n\n15\n00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,060\nNo,\n\n16\n00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,281\nI really,\n\n17\n00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:30,144\nI just say I've been a bit frustrated with the whole thing because the reality is\n\n18\n00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:33,346\nthat we invested a lot of money and for some reason and,\n\n19\n00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,107\nyou know,\n\n20\n00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:36,949\nI end up using a lot of tools that are not necessarily,\n\n21\n00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:37,449\nI don't say PCR.\n\n22\n00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,487\nI saw that you were using Dripify, which actually our sequencing would do that.\n\n23\n00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,241\nYeah,\n\n24\n00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,043\nso the sequencing,\n\n25\n00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,125\nat first I saw that we had a,\n\n26\n00:01:04,145 --> 00:01:05,047\nwhat do you call it,\n\n27\n00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:05,788\nthe sequencing included,\n\n28\n00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:06,830\nbut apparently not.\n\n29\n00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,566\nYeah, you're on a package.\n\n30\n00:01:15,521 --> 00:01:16,537\nLet me look at your agreement here.\n\n31\n00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:19,746\nbecause you were on sort of a premium sort of package,\n\n32\n00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:21,950\nbut it might have been before the sequencing happened.\n\n33\n00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,893\nLet's see what you have here.\n\n34\n00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,880\nI don't know what I'm paying.\n\n35\n00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,550\nRight now I know that I'm not necessarily using the tool the way I want.\n\n36\n00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,348\nI just see that I invested.\n\n37\n00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,296\nI got it in the tool back again.\n\n38\n00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,428\nWhen I left Management Recruiters, I didn't have the tool.\n\n39\n00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,866\nI was using Google and Driver,\n\n40\n00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,010\nand then I started to scale up,\n\n41\n00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,098\nand I ended up talking to Tino.\n\n42\n00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,503\nTino helped with establishing everything,\n\n43\n00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,028\nand I had a person in operation who invested a lot of money,\n\n44\n00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:00,370\nbut not going anywhere.\n\n45\n00:02:05,221 --> 00:02:06,473\nNow I am using Dripify.\n\n46\n00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,690\nI'm like, how do I use the sequencing that Tino told me how to use?\n\n47\n00:02:12,442 --> 00:02:13,593\nAnd now I need to pay extra.\n\n48\n00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:15,118\nI'm like, oh, whatever.\n\n49\n00:02:16,244 --> 00:02:17,036\nI don't even know.\n\n50\n00:02:19,444 --> 00:02:20,508\nThe good news is for that,\n\n51\n00:02:20,528 --> 00:02:22,314\nthe sequencing wouldn't be any extra monthly,\n\n52\n00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,679\nso it would not increase your monthly at all.\n\n53\n00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:27,073\nAnd I could even do you a deal if you were ever interested in adding it.\n\n54\n00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,389\nNormally it's $250 one time to add it.\n\n55\n00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:31,459\nIt adds it on.\n\n56\n00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,638\nIt gets you a couple hours.\n\n57\n00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,287\nSo I think I did pay that $250 because I do have sequencing.\n\n58\n00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:41,389\nI have access to sequencing.\n\n59\n00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,525\nSo once they told me that I don't have access to sequence,\n\n60\n00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:48,410\nand the training was given to me by Kino,\n\n61\n00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,851\nbut then Kino,\n\n62\n00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:49,151\nyou know,\n\n63\n00:02:49,191 --> 00:02:50,714\nevery time there was a sequence,\n\n64\n00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,555\nthere were like four roll-ups.\n\n65\n00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,312\nAnd so I had the AI, my operation person do it.\n\n66\n00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,848\nAnd long story short, it doesn't seem to, you know, I'm not getting any traction.\n\n67\n00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,342\nyou know when things things like this happen i i just i blame myself you know\n\n68\n00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:13,403\nanother day i have no one else to blame but that's where i am right now i i just\n\n69\n00:03:13,423 --> 00:03:17,524\nhave to let go one of my consultants because they were not uh invoicing and i'm\n\n70\n00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:22,286\npaying her so it's me and an",
