    "text": " Hello, this is Linda. Hi, this is Robin Mantoni. I'm going to stick on. Hey, Robin. Yes, I just had a quick question. I was going to send you an email. I am going to create the CSV from which I want to import people records. And I was just going to ask, is there anything specific I should think of before I create that CSV since it's not created yet that I should make sure to do or not do to make it? import nicely. Oh well there's a whole bunch of stuff. I mean if you have a list email it to me. Anything that's a custom field you want to make sure that your column heading is labeled the same. Like for example if you have like their LinkedIn URL you want it to be social underscore LinkedIn. How you see it in the layout. Duplicate checking can also be a huge issue. Like, you know, if you had John Smith with no email address and Mary Smith with no email, that will update the same record if you use the last name email address as your duplicate checking. So there's a lot of things that probably get a little tricky. And I'm so sorry, what is the last name, your last name? Oh, this is Linda Cooney. Oh, okay. Sorry. Okay. So then is the best thing to do to maybe import them and put them on a list and not dupe check? No, because then you're always going to get a dupe. I know. So you just want to make sure you're picking the duplicate checking option that will catch the most and not, but also not override. What I'm trying to do is I had been importing through the inhaler law firm profiles, right? I predominantly work with attorneys, but I have almost 300 law firms that I really need to do annually. And I found a tool that will grab the information from a website if I tell it to and put it in a CSV file. OK. And so knowing that I have people who are imported who are a hot mess because the importer doesn't do a great job anyway. Right. And so their their data is all over the place. and I could potentially be using this other technology to pull the same people. But I can't tell you that the other records are clean anyway yet because I haven't gotten to all of them. I have like three, maybe thousand that aren't clean. There is no, I would love to say yes. There's no good way. There's really not a clear answer always. Okay. Because, you know, what's really more current? what's already in your database, what's in your Excel file. There's really no way for us to really know because there's millions and millions of people in the world. Oh, yeah. I know, I know, I know, I know. Story of my life. I know it. You know, if you had last name, as long as you had last name in the email address for everybody, you could use it as a duplicate checking option and it will catch most of them. But if you have a lot of people where there is no email address, then you could be a little risky. Yeah. So the inhaler, because I'm using law firm profiles, they're not resumes, right? I'm pulling law firm profiles. So it doesn't pull them nicely. And there's not a good way to fix that. I don't think it is what it is. And it's the best I have. But it's, they're a hot mess. I mean, those records that I haven't manually gone in and fixed each one are a hot mess. And I'm getting to them as I get to them. But I have several thousand sitting there waiting. so uh i mean even it could be different people like sometimes you could even do like first name last name company name but as long as the first name last name company name but again if the company name is a little bit different in your database that could also be an even company name i mean like i'm i'm pulling from law firms they could have 25 locations right right i can't just tell it hey add it to this place no because i have to have it different in my database Okay. I'm going to noodle on this a little bit. I want to try this technology out, but before I do it, I want to do it in the way that will cause me the least amount of work later, because I think it will be a lot less work than using the inhaler to do it this way, because I can just straight map to at least minimally first name, last name, email, phone number, and I can't do that from the inhaler. now what I can send you like we had somebody do a webinar on importing did a really good job good one to watch I'll send you that and then I'll also send you like the instructions that we have for it too yeah I have the instructions I mean I know but I was just thinking if there's anything that you're like oh yeah people kind of trip in this or you know this makes it more difficult because I can I can map the information to go into the CSV vial however I want it, basically. And so if there's a way that makes it easier on the PCR side when it pulls that I don't have to go in and clean them other than, you know, the obvious things that I'm going to have to do. I'm probably going to have to manually attach them to their companies. I'm probably going to have to, you know, some of these things that it just requires human eyes, if you will. But it still could save me a lot of time. yeah kind of just depends how reliable is the data and how consistent I mean all the data's correct my biggest challenge is how messy everything pulls from the inhaler and and that's where I have the messiest data is the inhaler data but I have all those people on a list at least like I said I think it's three something thousand three thousand and some right now and maybe but all of those are manual imports maybe the better solution is maybe take your file into two files one that you would have the email address and one you wouldn't you know that way you can at least try to get some of them yeah i'll have to think about it okay thank you very much i appreciate it no problem have a good week thank you you too bye",
