    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Scott Shapiro with Stay Gold Solutions here in Charlotte. I set up a new employee in PCR and I got an alert message that says your MRI network username password cannot be verified. Please enter your login information by clicking the masthead menu. Okay. I don't know what that means. It says, if your account cannot be, if this is the case, please ignore this message. What's, I never heard of the masthead menu. I don't know what that is. I wonder if. I wonder if it's that PT web sync stuff. What's the username? Kay Sullivan, just how it's spelled, all capitals. Okay. I wonder if they're referring to... Do you connect with MRI network stuff, like the referral, the PT web? Your MRI network is not verified. Please enter your login information by clicking on the map. Because she's in, she's not, I mean, I put her in the MRI network central directory. Okay. So when you go at the very top right, something I haven't had to do in a very long time, go at the very top right of P-Secure, that gear icon, yeah kind of floats at the end of the end of the user image I've never called it math yeah yeah he needs to do that sync MRI network credentials option okay hold on that's what's it invalid let me let me try that again sync username user as invalid username or password that's a possible let me try again oh Oh, because it's... Oh, MRI password. That's why. I see. Okay. I got it. So it's... Yep. All set. That's what it was. All right. All righty. Have a great week. You're welcome. You too. Bye. END",
