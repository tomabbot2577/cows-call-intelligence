    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. Tyler, how can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Tia Falcone from Professional Search Network. And I got a new laptop, and I cannot get into my PCR. I can't get into my email, and I need help, please. So with your PC recruiter, are you going to your database URL? No, I don't even know how to get to all that stuff. That's what I'm saying. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do. Okay, so I can send you your database URL, and then you'll just put in your username and password for PC Recruiter. Perfect. Yeah, I think that was when I was – nobody can seem to find it right now, so I thought it would be quicker to call you. Yep, so let me send this over to you. Yeah, because each PC recruiter customer has their own. Right. It said you need your own work or personal URL address, and that's what I think I need, and nobody seems to have it right now. Yep. So let me – what's a good email for you? My first name, Tia, T-I-A. Yep. At psnri.com. Perfect. All right. I just emailed that on over to you. Well, the only thing is, is I can't get into my email either. So I had to do it. Like even on the web, you can't get into your email? Yeah. Do you know who hosts your email? Is it like Outlook or Gmail? No, I do it through Outlook. Okay. But when I go to go into my email, it says, okay, it'll say email address, TFPA, connect. And then it says password, IMAP account settings, password. And then I put in the password. Hold on a minute. I'm not used to this computer. Hold on. I put in my password, and then it says we're getting things ready. And then I checked with my assistant. We couldn't connect to the incoming IMAP server. Please check the incoming IMAP server. And I did that with her, and it still wasn't working, unless I was typing in the wrong information. Yeah, I would say verify that you have the right email password there. Okay. So it says change account settings. Okay, so I'm trying to do all that again. Hold on, if you're okay, I'm just trying to type everything in. not a problem Oh, wait, she sent me the wrong information. Hold on, wait a minute. Let me do the outgoing because I want to make sure this works. Thank you. I'm almost there, sorry. No, not a problem. Yeah, Microsoft likes to take its good old time every now and again. Okay, I put everything in. It says we're getting things ready. Let's see if it works this time. this time. Nope. Could not connect to the IMAP. Sorry. Are you the admin for your Microsoft account? no so whoever you're I would double check with whoever that admin is or like if you have a separate IT company that helps set those up he said I haven't used PCR in a while and you have to call them up well so setting it up setting up your IMAP and Outlook is a Microsoft thing not a PC recruiter thing okay like we have the add-in inside of outlooks like that's a separate thing that you can install but like just setting up your regular email that would be whoever like hosts your email and your whatever your it does to set that up okay and then this thing that you emailed me on my phone well i'd have if i could get this email set up then I can do it on my computer right yeah so that the what I sent you was just your PCR URL so you could log in on the web and get in okay so even if you just type out that whole web address into a yeah that'll take you to your PC recruiter login page oh okay Okay, let me try to get a hold of the person I need to reach and then see if... Yeah, and I'm also going to send you the... Just so you have it when you can get into the email. We have the step-by-step instructions on how to add in that Outlook portal extension or add in into Outlook. Okay. All right, thank you so much. Yep, not a problem. Have a great day. Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.",
