    "text": " I'm sorry. I didn't catch your first name. Robin. Robin, this is Chris shuttle. I think we talked yesterday briefly about my PC career. Well, I think Caitlin had called you and, and tried to use the Zeni to turn the bell. Yes. Yeah. You were out of the office. Yeah. You're on to the office. Okay. It's probably best I do a screen share with you. Do you happen to have RingCentral? Yeah, RingCentral. Oh, perfect. Okay. I don't know if I need to take a break. I also have Teams, if you want. I don't have – I don't really use Teams. So let's try RingCentral. And I don't really use RingCentral. I have it. I'm sure I can figure out how to get this done. Let's see here. Okay. So let me set up a meeting for you. here so if you open up your app yeah and go to video and select join The installation package cannot be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access or contact the application vendor. All right. Let's see. Well, hold on. Let's get rid of that. Let's see if it works better now. Oh, it's that my threat locker is, let's stop it now. Hold on, let me get IT on the phone with us, and I'll just give him the... I could do it other ways. How about Google Meet? That one's easy. Okay. Because you're going to email me a Google link, right? Yeah. Let me go here. Let's see, meet, new meeting, start an incident. Okay. And what is your email address? Chris at ManhattanResources.com. HRIS at ManhattanResources.com. Okay. San Euswadi right now. Thank you. Join call? Yes. yes password I swear to God I hate passwords I freaking hate them Thank you. that home address what is it asking me what are you doing wait what it should just it should just be a link that you click on uh well you said to hit join call so i did um wait so it should be a link i'm gonna go to my email what did i send you yeah hold on it's just making you do stuff but All right, here we go. Looks like it's doing it. Allow camera and microphone. Use microphone and camera. Actually, we don't need those for this. We're going to be, well, actually, we're going to have to, sometimes you get prompt for screen recording, which really means sharing your screen. I'll do whatever you want me to do. It says, ready to join, ask to join. Okay. All right. I'm just going to join my meeting. That must be you. Admit. Okay. All right. All right. So you're – oops. I'm going to join without audio. Go ahead and mute your microphone. Do you want to mute the mic or just hang up on you? Either way, on the meeting. We're already on the phone. Otherwise, it echoes. All right. yeah I needed the computer which is I think what you wanted me to do yeah that's fine okay so let me refresh my memory your ticket was let me find it here's what's going on when I get those yeah when I get emails from customers or send emails to customers I want them to be logged in PCR yeah and for a while they were and now all of a sudden they're not yeah I think if I remember right when I looked at it you would have to re-authenticate it could be that security's changed since you originally set it up or even your password changed so here's I'm going to have you do at the bottom of your meeting screen if you can click share screen it's the rectangle with the arrow Okay, and then go over to where it says entire screen. That will be at the right. So keep in mind I have three screens. Okay. So when you go over to entire screen in that pop-up, it's going to show you a preview of each of those three screens. Click on the one that you want to share. and then hit share. Okay. All right. So I'm going to have you, I see your Outlook. Let's have you open a PC Recruiter. Actually, I wonder if you were doing this, or there's a couple things possibly going on. Okay. So the one I would do is for PCR mail, and then we'll come over and look at your Outlook too. So let's have you on this window. Let's have you go to PC Recruiter. Get you fixed up in both places, it looks like. Okay. And if you need, you can see it over there so you can see it, I guess. Oh, it looks like you left the meeting. You might have closed the meeting window. I did. Hold on. That was ridiculous. Can you hear me still? Yes. All right. All right. Yeah, I guess I just tried to open PCR while I was in the meeting, and it closed you. I'm sorry. That's okay. Yeah, you got to keep that browser tab open. Yeah, I'm going to go back in it. So hold on. And then when it prompts you about joining with computer audio, just say no to that. So this thing right here, you're not in the meeting, so you can't see what I'm doing. Why is that screen not open? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. All right. Now I'm going to go to the shared screen again. Yeah. Go ahead and mute so it doesn't echo. All right. Now I'm going to go to the shared screen again. Yeah, go ahead and mute so it doesn't echo. All right. The entire screen. Yes, it's here. Okay. So keep this tab open, but then go over to your first tab that has Peace Recruiter. So you want me to click on this? Yes. Isn't that going to close you? Nope, because you are keeping this. Your third tab is your meeting screen. Okay, let's go ahead and have you sign in. So it looks like you have two setups, really, for email. You have PCR mail, which wasn't authenticated. And then it looked like when you showed me Outlook, you also had the PCR portal added. Both of these can write activities, but if you ever get into using analytics or, like, mail campaign sequencing, it's best to always have PCR mail set up. So we'll get that fixed, and then we'll pop over to your Outlook, too. So let's go ahead and say don't show me this guide in the future. Skip. Okay. So skip over at the bottom right of that screen. Okay. All right. At the very top right of PC Recruiter, there's a gear icon. It floats on the edge of the user image. Perfect. Go to email. First option. Okay, so it looks like you were set up here. I remember, right? Okay, go to configure. Go to mail servers. And then on that row at the bottom, go to action and select edit. So this was your incoming mail settings. Where's action? Over at the left on that row at the bottom. It's at the very left of it. Oh, I got it. There you go. Yes. Go to edit. Edit. Okay. Here at the bottom right, click test connection. If I remember right, I checked this and it was failing. Yeah, it failed. Okay. Exit the test connection pop-up screen. click the black sign in with Microsoft option if you already signed in this might go pretty fast okay now hit test connection completed perfect exit the test prompt and then save down at the bottom right Okay, and once that saves, let's close that window. So that was to get your folders and download the incoming, so that'll fix that. The other thing that we have to do is see up at the top in the middle where it says alias address list? That's your settings for sending an email. So let's choose that option. It's going to show you a card at the bottom. the pencil icon on the corner of that card and I believe this one was also failing so let's try this sign in with Microsoft not just connection now I think I already I think I checked this yesterday and it was failing okay now hit test connection perfect exit here and then save So now, like you got some bad setup over at the top left there. I think somebody did a bad setup at some point. If you scroll down way over at the left, keep going down. See at the very bottom there, you have Office 365 Mail. Hit the plus sign next to that. And then now scroll down again more. So these are your folders that you have. And now that reauthenticated, that'll fix the syncing. So that way you have the activities. You'll also have those emails in the emails tab right from the candidate's name record. So that'll fix that. Now let's also have you open your Outlook. Okay. so see what says okay at the within your PC recruiter ribbon up at the top if you go about a third of the way over where it says options to see how it says logged out something's up over here so let's see what's going on let's go to options let's hit test connection oh I think I know what this is this is out of date that's probably why okay let's exit here and exit just hit save and close at the bottom I think this one it's a very outdated version so let's exit from this window and then close out look completely you see this login yeah you're right? Yeah, go ahead and close that. Okay. Okay. What I'm going to have you do is open up a new tab. Yeah. Close all windows. Hold on. There's a whole bunch of opens. Let me get them closed. And it's all closed. Okay, perfect. Okay. So what I'm going to have you do now is open up a new tab in your browser and type in PC recruiter downloads. Okay go ahead and click on that purple downloads link that you see right there. Perfect. Okay we're going to scroll down on this page it'll be at the far left it's the second add-in called peace recruiter from Microsoft Outlook click on that green link and it's downloading at the top right of your browser right now now Once that's done, we're going to open it up and run it. And that will put you on the more recent version. It's a portal add-in for Outlook. So we'll have PCR do your email activity writing, but at least you'll be able to use the portal. Like if you want to right-click, parse the resume. Both can write activities, but you only need one of them to do it. You get some other nice features. Okay, go ahead and click on that. This right here? Yep, click right there. Oh, you know what? My threat lockers are causing a problem. Hold on, let me get that fixed. I'm going to add... Don't freak out. I'm going to add somebody to the call. Let's see here. All right, I'm going to try to add him one more time. Okay. All right. So I'm going to have to choose him a text and tell him he needs to call me. Okay. Your PCR mail is at least now corrected. Because what happened, it looks like your last email that you had downloaded was June 12th. So my guess is somewhere around that time, Maybe you changed your Office 365 password. I don't know. Honestly, so you said something earlier about using sequencing. I need something else. I'm about to upgrade to PCRM and add sequencing. Yeah, so that PCR mail that we were in, if you go over to that second tab, you would have to have PCR mail set up so this will now be working and the reason is is when like let's say you set up a sequence or a mail campaign you need a tracker reply it needs to download into here so we can read the tracking image to say this is a reply to this sequence or to this mail campaign you had this set up as far as getting the email in it's just stopped authenticating it looks like sometime around June 12th but now that we've reconnected it yeah now it's going to work so if I send an email from Outlook or from PCR either one it's going to end up in PCR and if I resume an email it'll end up in PCR yeah so if you go to your inbox now see down at the very bottom left there on your screen so go up a little bit It's starting to catch up. There's still a couple little gaps, but it's fetching them. Now you're starting to get the recent ones. If you scroll down, you might see a little gap between what it's pulling up until June 12th. Give it about 15 minutes, and it'll probably be caught up. So you're saying it's going to sink all that stuff? Yep. Yeah, you've had this set up. Hey, Mike's calling. Hold on. Don't go anywhere. Mike. Hey, Chris. Sorry. You're on the phone with me and PCR. Okay. I'm going to connect to your computer. Okay. So ThreatLocker is the problem. Okay. So let's go back to what we were trying to do before ThreatLocker got us. Okay. Let me put it in. Let me put ThreatLocker in learning mode. Hold on. Let PCR drive. so we downloaded an updated version of our pcr portal add-in for his outlook and then he's getting a prompt as we'll let him open it can you can you submit it well i can't now because we're not in the same place mike you're gonna we need to go back to what we were trying to do and then we'll get oh shit mike just threw everybody off um all right hold on I still have you on. Oh you can still see my screen? Yeah if you take him to your downloads folder that's where that file is that apparently we need him to run. Yeah all right so PCRportal.exe it says this is what happens right there Mike. Hold on one second let me get into the to this section here. Let's see. . Okay. So computers. Manhattan. Okay. So Chris. Where is this? Chris 21. Okay. So we're going to say application learning mode. Advanced. Okay. Do you see that Windows cannot access screen, Mike? Yeah. Yeah. I'm putting the machine in learning mode real quick. Let's see. Application learning mode. Add schedule. Let's see. Application recruiter. Okay. So now I got it in learning mode. Let me get back onto your computer. What? If it's in learning mode, does that mean it'll work? Yeah, it's going to learn the application, so it approves it going forward. All right, I'm going to hit okay, and I'm going to go back to downloads. I'm going to exercise it again, see what happens. Same problem. Let me check our threat locker. rapid chicken you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you Thank you. Thank you. you you you you you you you you So this doesn't look like a PCR problem anymore. This looks like a Manhattan resources problem. Yeah, so we have your PCR mail reauthenticated, so that'll pull them in. I'm just trying to get you updated on that Outlook portal, Adam. No, I'm with you. I'll tell you what, I've got a staff meeting that's already started. I feel like Mike keeps trying to figure this out. Can I call you back when I get done with staff? Of course. All right, I appreciate it. I want to keep you on while Mike's trying to figure out. Oh, wait, it looks like it's starting. Yeah, I think we got it. I'm just going to run through this install. And sign in for Outlook. I mean, I guess it was, I mean, maybe ThreatLocker that was telling us wrong password. I mean, I don't know why PCR would even launch if it was ThreatLocker. But maybe the new version will make it work. he had version 5.14 of our portal add-in and we had to change some locations of things or whatever I forgot what the reason is, it needs to be on version 5.30 so that's what I'm trying to get to him so we got it installed and should that be it or do we need to configure anything else? the only thing I'd like to do is just confirm that it is connecting okay so we got this here and it should pop up the login Chris your staff meeting you need your computer because you're doing a team like a team call or something yeah Chris just give me a call back then when you're done with your meeting okay alright I will. All right. Yeah. Thank you, ma'am. You'll leave me your email activities for now. Those will catch up pretty soon. You're welcome. It looks like it worked, right? I think it signed in. Well, yeah, but to what version? The new version because we just installed it. If you go into Peace Recruiter Ribbon and go to options, remember where we were before? Yeah. Mike said let me drive. I'll drive. Go ahead. I'll let you drive. Go ahead. All right. All right. I opened it. 530. 530. Perfect. And then hit test connection. And does it say success? Yeah, success. Okay. You should be good. All right. Thank you. You are welcome. Have a great week. Thanks. All right. Bye-bye. I got to go. Bye. All right. Bye.",
