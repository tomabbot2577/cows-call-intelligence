    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, hi. Scott Hobart from TICOM Life Sciences Recruiting. I want to straighten out my most recent bill. Okay. Let me go over to your information. Hold on one second. Sure. Let's see. I attempted to do this on my phone a few days ago, and I guess it didn't take, but I got another message. oh let me see what's going on with yours let's see it should have sent an invoice to scott.hobar okay and you received that email right okay yeah i'm like my outlook is my pc I'm in the middle of a move, and I'm in the middle of this array right now. Gotcha. I got it on the phone, and I tried to input the information you needed to update my billing information, but decided to go with human beings. Okay. Let's see. You do have auto pay enabled with a card that ends in 0521. Is that still correct? That's still correct. Okay. Do you want me to just try doing the auto-pay on it, on the open invoice? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. It should have auto-paid. Let me see. Yeah, I'm wondering why it didn't work. It's been working for years. Well, we did switch billing systems, so you have to kind of put in your new card, which it looks like you did. Correct. Let me see what's going on here. Why is the email open? Maybe it's sometime it's good. Okay, let me try it. Let me make sure it processes them. Bear with me one second. Okay. Let's hear if you wish to auto pay. $119.95. Yep, ma'am. Okay, it's been queued for auto pay. It takes a moment here. Okay. Well, let me see. timeline. Sorry, new system kind of figure out which place is the best place to go to see what's going on. Transactions. Oh, cards being declined. It doesn't tell me why. You want to double check all the information on the card? Yeah, let me see that. Let me, I don't know if it tells me all that. I can try. Let's see. Edit. I don't know if it says email. I changed my mailing address with the bank, but that shouldn't affect any of this. All I could see is it ends in 0521. So what I could do is add a new card and try it again. Scott, space, Hobart is the name on the card, right? It's actually Scott, space, M, space, Hobart. M as in Michael. Okay. And then the card number? 5581-8520-0000-0521. Expiration date? I'm sorry, 01-29. The CVC number? 213. Address, 1281 Wynn Hemshell Boulevard. Yeah, you know what? Let's just make it my home. I'm working out of the home office now. Okay. So are you ready? Yeah. 1-0-6-5. Okay. 3rd Avenue. That's 3rd Avenue. Northwest is just N-W. Okay. and that's the town of Carmel C-A-R-M-E-L Indiana you are up by one of my favorite restaurants which one? Verde okay it's like an Ironworks up by was it something crossing I went to Indianapolis for a soccer tournament it was so good what is the zip code this is all the information associated with the zip code I'm sorry, with the card, right? Okay. 46032. 46032. And that's all the address associated with the card? Yeah, it should be. Okay. Maybe that's the thing. I changed the address with the card. That could be. Feels like a bad response. We're trying to expect a status code. They won't let me do it. Okay. Okay. Okay, what do I do then? I didn't like something I put in it. You want to run it all back, make sure we got it right? Well, it kind of removed everything that I did. And I don't know if it's the other card that is stored. But I don't have security to delete a card either. You're in billing. It should be yours. Yeah, I don't know if they just didn't give it to me or because I know like our bookkeeper has access to it or if it's just supposed to be like you're supposed to do it on your own. And I wonder if it didn't like because there was a card already ending in that number, but it doesn't let me take that out. Are you you're not at your computer right now, right? I am actually. Okay, I'm going to do this. I'm going to send you a link to the customer portal. Hold on one second here. Do you know what? You want to send it to a different address? Because my Outlook on my PC is jacked up. It's not getting emails. I get them on my phone. Well, okay. I don't. I think you'll have to register. You'll need to be where you're scott.hobar at touchandrecruiting.com. Okay. Well, I can do that on my phone. Okay. All right, so I'm just going to do it this way then. Let me just manually email it to you. Hold on one second. Compose. Add in. Okay, and I'm going to Customer Portal. Do you know if you've created an account in this Customer Portal link or did you just kind of pay from the invoice before from our new system? I'm not sure I understand the question. I got the email, and I see I opened it on my phone, and I think I went through the process of updating the information. When you paid in June, did you just kind of pay from the new invoice? Oh, no. In June is the last one that I paid, correct? Yeah. Yeah, that was just an automatic payment. unless our bookkeeper kind of went into the back end and did it. So we have a new billing portal. I mean, you're supposed to put in, and it looks like you put on auto pay. So you must have paid from a new invoice at some point. Okay. So I just sent you an email. Okay. And then there's a link in there. There's a billing portal link? Yes. Is that you? Robin Montoni came from? Yep. Okay. That is me. So what you need to do is create an account or sign up. I forget how it's worded. All right, let me click on the link here. Log into your account. Now you'll need to do sign up. Okay. Or create an account. Sign up. Okay, create an account, okay? Okay, so you'll need to put in the email address that I just sent it to because that's what's associated with your account, and then create a password that would be for the site. And it's for this site only. So scott.hobar at ticonrecruiting.com already exists. Please log in. I just used the memorized password and email address in my phone. So should I back up and try again and create a new password? Try again with a password that you have saved. It wouldn't be your PCR password, so apparently you might have done this at some point. yeah I mean so if I try to populate the email box my phone is asking you used your safe password yeah try that okay might be that you've done this from your phone before yeah and so that's what I just did and I get a box that says user with email scott.vobar at iconrecruiting.com already exists please log in okay so please log in Okay. Is it getting in you and now with whatever saved? Yep. I'm in. Okay. So over at the right, there's a section called vault. At least when I look at it from a computer, I haven't done it from a phone yet. There should be a vault. I'm on my phone. I scroll to the right. Is it on the line with amount and status? There should be an area called vault, which is where you manage your card. Okay, I don't see the vault work, but let me click around a little bit. Yeah. Oh, here we go. All right, I'm on vault. Okay. So there you're going to have a card that's set up. Are you able to go in and click edit on that? It looks like it's – I clicked on vault and it just – Yeah, should I delete the card that's in there? Yeah, go ahead. I think you've got to turn off auto-pay first before it lets you delete it, and then re-add your card information. And then just make sure that you're using whatever details are, like zip code and things like that that's associated with the card. Yes, yes. All right, let's see. Delete payment method, okay. will be deleted. Okay. Delete. Okay. Then you're going to add your... Unable... Unable delete payment method. This payment method is set up for autopay. Please cancel autopay. Okay. Yeah. You have to turn off the autopay first on that card. Oh, okay. All right. So autopay no. Vault. Delete. Delete. How would you like it? No, it said no. So I'm looking at auto-pay invoices, and I have clicked no. Oh, I need to save that, I think. So I'll save that. Okay, now I'll try again through vault. Go in and delete. Okay. It's listed right above. Auto-pay is on for that card. Is it letting you know? Okay. Okay. I think I'm back to zero. Now it's off. Okay. Now it's off. So then go ahead and add your card. Okay. So add payment method. Okay. So. And then once you add the new card in, then you can turn auto pay on for that card. All right. I'm trying to add myself, but when I click on add payment method, the only option that it's showing me is stored card. Okay. I went on to that. Okay. All right. So let me change everything here. Here's Scott. And hold on. Card number. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now I'm going to change the address. 104.W Northwest. Carmel, Indiana. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. 46032. Enable auto-pay, yes. Save. All right. I think... In a moment, I'll check to see what I can find. Okay. AutoPay is back in there. And then did you try to process it again? I'm trying right now. That's the last one. All right, it's processing. Okay. Approved. Did we solve the riddle and make it work? I am. Yep, that one went through. So maybe it was the mismatch in zip code from what you had before? I think it must be related to the change of address somehow, yeah. Okay. Now, while I have you on that, because that is just for our billing portal, why don't I change it everywhere else that we may need it? Yes, ma'am. Let's do it. Let's see. Okay. What was the address again? You ready? It's 1065 3rd Avenue. That's a 3RD Northwest MW. Okay. And they are MEL. Okay. MEL, Indiana. Okay. And the zip is 46032. 46032. Okay. I will get this kind of adjusted in other places and get that done for you. Okay. We're all set? Yep. I think you're all set. Thank you for your help. I really appreciate it. You are welcome. Thank you. Have a good week. Have a great day. Bye-bye.",
