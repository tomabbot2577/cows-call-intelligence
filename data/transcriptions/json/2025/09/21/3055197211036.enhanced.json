    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yes, hi. I'm replacing one person, and I haven't done some stuff in a while. So I enter a name, but I duplicate, so I would like to merge this name. I mean, actually, I'm supposed to add the resume, but I create a duplicate. So can you help me to merge two contacts? Sure. What's your name and what company are you with? Warbridge Partners, Daniela Sofiska. Warbridge Partners. And he said, what was your name? I'm sorry. Daniela Sofiska. Got it. Okay. So let's see. To merge two people into one name record, you would have to search for them in the basic search. Okay. I found them. Okay, perfect. and check the box to the left of each of those. Okay. And then in the action, there's like a, I think it's the icon is four arrows pointing at each other. It's in the action menu. See, I can't find that one. Where is the action? So select, and okay, action, I want to, and there is an action. So not under the I want to column. It's actually usually at the top right. Sometimes you have to click the three horizontal lines to see more options in that list. I have a basic search result. Then I have basic, advanced, career builder, and then I have a drop-down, and I have basic, advanced, career builder, and ZoomInfo. Maybe on the right side, do you have another handful of icons? questions. It has like a question mark, email, link to position, roll-up names, planner. Okay. If you click on the three horizontal lines at the end of that list, it'll show you all the options, even ones that you haven't pinned. Okay. Customize, merge names. Okay. There it is. Yep. And then in the new screen that pops up, you'll just check the box under the master record, the one that you want to kind of merge into. Okay, and I have this one that I have director of operation but doesn't have a resume. So does the resume for that one that I want to merge going to go to this one? This one doesn't have, I mean, the main record that I want to be used doesn't have a resume. So the resume is going to go, right? So go just merge, merge. Yeah, let's do that. I'm going to just do it on my end. Confirm when merging duplicate into one, the other records will be deleted. Okay. So just to click okay, correct? Correct. Okay. And then close? Perfect. Okay, but didn't merge. Didn't merge. Why? Why? so if you do that search again does it still have both names no only one so I need to refresh now this page reload it's been a while I've been with 10 years since I haven't done the PC oh I see no problem I used to do this and I was like okay you know I can do this But then it's like, okay, it's kind of not the same. Yeah, it's sometimes hard to remember all the little snaps. Okay, I have another name to merge, but I got it. Thank you so much for your help. Okay, cool. Yeah, let us know if you need anything else. Uh-huh, that will do. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
