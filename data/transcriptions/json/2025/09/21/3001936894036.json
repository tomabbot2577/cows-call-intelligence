    "text": " Hello. Tag, you're it. Robin? Yes. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you now. How are you doing? Okay. I'm good. How are you? Good. So maybe you can help me out? Yeah. So what's going on? Oh, I thought I indicated in my email maybe you didn't get it. So I'm having problems with PCR capture. I don't know if there's I'm having problems with Java or if there's an updated version or or what's going on but it's very very random when I when I can get it like I'm going to people on LinkedIn and okay especially like what happens is I'll connect with somebody and they're new and usually I go click on their name and I do PCR capture and put them in the system and they're not it's not pulling up the pcr capture it's not pulling up that option okay let's do a screen share what yeah i mean yeah let's do a screen share see what's going on it could be that you have an old version you might have two versions it could be another extension interfering a couple things it could be so it's probably best to just see it all right so let's see here let's go to me do you have ring central by any chance i don't think i have it no just send me whatever All right. So, yes, I'll just do a Google beat then. Bear with me one. Oh, gosh, why do I have so many open here? Bear with me one second. Yeah. Here it is. Okay. It could be some of Java because I did, I mean, I've got some kind of error message. Please refer to the Java install did not complete. I don't know what's going on. I just, I don't know. that's usually yeah it's usually well if it's a PCR capture it's just the extension itself so it's either something with that extension or it's a conflict with another extension so I'm just going to take a peek I think like always one called loom I think there was sometimes a conflict sometimes like we have more that like different extensions they're kind of competing with each other trying to do something on the page so we'll figure it out okay so I just sent you a link to join a meeting did you email it yeah okay join call I think there should be a link like join Google meet or something how's it worded join call it says it's meet join call yeah I'm gonna join call okay Do you want people to see and hear you in the meeting? Yes. Actually, you could say to join without the camera and not the microphone since we're already on the phone. And we're going to be watching your screen. We don't need your camera. Okay. Okay. I'm admitting you. All right. So you're in the meeting now. Oh, shoot. Now I've got you. Now I've got the. Oh, no. I turned my microphone off. I forgot to turn my microphone off. Okay. We're all set. Okay. So in the meeting, at the bottom, you're going to click share screen. It's the rectangle with the arrow. And then you're going to go over to entire screen. Once that window pops up, let me know when you're there. Yep. It popped up. Yep. Okay. You might see a preview if you have more than one monitor, but you're going to have to pick what screen to show under entire screen. Yep. And then click share. Get it. okay so let's just see something here first so um let's click on that black puzzle piece icon at the top right of your browser where you just passed it one to the left i don't it's called the manage it's called the extensions icon okay you've got hunter email finder okay let's go down to manage extensions okay and that's the right version so that's good okay let's click directly on the extension do we need to remove some of those is that no problem i don't know yet we're gonna we're gonna find out we're gonna do a process of elimination here let's click directly on the extension it's that green, blue, and purple right at the top right of your browser? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Basic mode is off. And then do you like to get the company or do you just want them all going to your default? I'm not sure. I've had it forever. No, I don't want them going to the default. I want it to look for the company. I don't want them just going to candidates. I want them to actually go into the company where they are. Okay. So see at the very bottom right of the PCR capture pop-up screen where it says capture to decal company? If you can turn that option off. Okay. All right. Let's close this window. Okay. Let's go over to your LinkedIn. Yep. Okay. And then let's see what else I maybe want to do. So let's see over at the very far left. It's got the kind of like refresh, reload icon. It's the circle with the arrow. It's at the very top left, just left of the URL. I just want to see if it pops up. Hit refresh. Yeah. Yeah, so that time it did. And sometimes it does, and a lot of times it doesn't. So I'm just going to add him quick. Do you happen to have sometimes where you go from one person to another and then like you might have more than one person's LinkedIn page up? Sometimes, yes. I wonder if that could be it. because one of the things that could be going on is maybe that you, what do you call it, you have, where are the words I'm picking up? Where it's maybe kind of read on one page, where it's trying to read on one page. So if you pop up another, it's kind of like in use almost on another page. Not usually. Not usually. No. That hasn't been a problem. So if I go to, because I don't do that much. If I go to my network here and I go to connections here. Can you see what I'm doing? Yeah. Yes. Okay. So I click on brand and call in. That hasn't been coming up as ad. Okay. Let me see what's going on here. It's still not. It's still not. See that? I just clicked on it. It's not coming up on the bottom or to the far right. You see that? All right. That normally would come up right away. Yeah. Okay. So let's see. What else could be being used here? Maybe if there's a conflict. Because I know if you use that reload when it doesn't load, it basically forces you to recognize, like, hey, I'm on this page now. Yeah, that's fine for work run. It's just I've never had to do that before. I don't really want to do that. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, normally it pops right up. Let's click directly on that extension again at the top right for just a moment. Okay. This has only been happening in the last week, I would say. Okay. Everything's worked fine forever. I don't know what's going on. Yeah. Okay. Let's exit this because those are all selected. That's not it. There's not too many on there or something? No, no. All it really just means is we'll even try if you go to one of these URLs. That's really all that means. Okay. Okay. Okay. So let's close this pop-up. Let's go to that manage extensions option again. So the black puzzle piece. And let's go to manage extensions, which is at the bottom. Let's just temporarily see what says Hunter email finder. Yeah. Oh, don't you have to remove? Well, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to have to remove it. I just want you to turn it off for a moment. I want to see if this can be causing a conflict. so see the little slider let's turn that one off anything else hide my history that one's already off chat gpt search let's take that one off too because was that something yeah did anything did it start after maybe adding one of these other extensions well i didn't add one of these other i didn't add that extension on purpose i did notice that When I go to Google, now it automatically brings me into chat GPT search, which I don't want. When I go to Google, so that's weird. Maybe that's all new. So I wonder if something just happened with that. So I'm going to turn that one off too. Yeah, let's turn that off. Okay, so let's now go back over to your LinkedIn tab. Yeah, change default search engine to chat GPT search. I don't want that. I don't want that. So I wonder if I should remove that. Okay. Yeah, that's up to you. I'm going to remove that. I'm going to remove that and just see what happens. Okay. Okay. All right, let's go back over to your LinkedIn tab. Okay. Yep. Okay. Now, this one right now, because I kind of left it, let's do the refresh at the top left, because that will certainly force it. Okay, now let's go to, like, my network. and now here if you find actually i want to show you an option because i know you're going pretty quick and i don't want you to make duplicate or new companies um when you yeah that did we just turn that off because i that that's what i wondered why we changed that thing so what i did do when i i've done this forever so i know what i'm doing to not do duplicate companies but i wonder if by you and me shutting that thing off if that's what it's doing i don't want them going to candidates I want them going to the other company. Right. So the thing is when you just kind of like don't pick the company or the, like if it's, say for example, if you go to click to update. So go to click to update for a moment. Yeah. I usually do pick the name and the company. Whenever you get this screen, if you pick, if you click the box. Yeah, that's updating. But if you hit the, don't. Okay. So the bottom, if you don't want to update, you just want to pick the company. what you would do is when you get the possible matches for the company hover on that company card that you see at the bottom right and hit the check box that way you're only picking the company and not updating when you advance and if you don't do either you're creating a new company so now when you click review you'll notice something that might be a little bit different let's hit review so hold on so I don't just click the company I actually have to click the box well it depends if If you just click on the company card when you advance, you're actually updating the company. If you really just want to pick it and leave the company record exactly as it is in PC Recruiter, then you would just hover on the company and hit the checkbox instead. Okay. Maybe can you dummy that down a little differently for me so I can make sure I'm doing it the right way? So let's say you already had – Let's say you're a different person. Let's go to a different person. Let's go to the next person. So let's – so then you can show me. So my network, I want to see if there's a new connection. So J5, let's see if this works. So click on J5. Yep, still not working. Okay. Well – Just to go back to the last point, I'll hit refresh here. That'll force it. Okay, now I do click to add. Okay, so see how it came up where this company is a potential match, like something already in your database? If you don't want to make any changes or updates to the company, if you hover on the card at the bottom, and then see there comes a checkbox? Click it. So then when you hit review down at the bottom, you're creating a new name, but you just are picking the existing company. You're not updating anything on the company record. Got it. And normally I don't update anything on the company record. Okay. So then you could just hit submit. So that way, if you ever, you know, you have the address exactly as you want it on the company record. you're not changing by what the company has on their profile. So I think the checkbox is safer to use. Yeah, me too. Okay. Okay, now we've got to figure out why this is still not popping up. Yeah. Okay, let's go to the three vertical dots at the top right of Chrome. Yeah. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where are we? Where are we? Yeah, so go back over. Okay, the three vertical dots at the very top right of Chrome. Yeah. Let's go down. Well, we might get kicked out of the meeting. I might have to have you rejoin when you get back. Let's try clearing cache. I don't think it usually has anything to do with it, but let's go to delete browsing data. Make sure the time range says last. I'm sorry instead of last 24 hours switch that to all time. Uncheck. No, don't hit that yet. Uncheck browsing history and cookies. Leaving only cached images and files selected. Now select delete data. Okay. Now I'm going to have you go back to those three vertical dots. Go down at the very bottom. go to help, and go to about Google Chrome. I think there's something wrong with my Google Chrome. So it's updating now, and then when it's done, it's going to relaunch, which might take you out of the meeting, and so you might have to jump back in. So I might lose you for a moment, but I have you on the phone, so we can still at least talk. Okay. Okay, hit relaunch. And then hit leave. Okay, so you left the meeting. You're going to have to go back to my email and rejoin, unless it kind of takes you right back in after it reloads. Yes, what's this? I've done this PCR captures popping up. That's weird. That's never done that before. Yeah, that's only because we cleared cash. Okay, so what do you want me doing? Go back to my meeting invite. Error, error. I'm not sure what's going on. Okay, what's your meeting invite? Okay. Okay. Go back to the share screen option. okay okay let's go back over to the linkedin um tab it said you are presented yeah just keep this tab open because that's our meeting go back over to his linkedin tab okay okay let's uh thank you do another one yeah let's go back over to somebody else let's go over to somebody else it just hasn't happened it's something I think something's going on with Chrome but I don't know yeah see it's not coming up okay hold on let's see is it something with the cash with LinkedIn because the other thing I can think of is my wife had a problem with her. She was having a problem with her laptop, so she was using my laptop last week for a day, and she is on LinkedIn sometimes, so I wonder if maybe she went on LinkedIn. I don't see why that would have been an issue. I don't even know if she did that, but who knows. I don't know. I wonder if you have browser blocker extensions, browser questions. I already did that part. I mean, something very recent. Like, this hasn't happened until, like, I think. Let's try. Yeah, I wonder if it has something to do. Add blocker. Add blocker extension might interfere with the extension. So I'm going to add blocker. It's blocking elements. Let's see. It's not. Okay. Okay, we rolled out other ones. Let's do this. Let's see. No, no, go back. So that time it popped up. It popped up because I just hit refresh. Oh, okay. Let's try this. click directly click on the extensions icon again that black puzzle piece and go to manage extensions and scroll down to where you see piece recruit actually hold on one second I got capture scroll up one more time Google Docs offline no No, that wouldn't do it, neither would Adobe. Pretty much everybody has those, so it's definitely not those. Okay, let's scroll down a little bit. It's got the other two disabled, so it's not that. My history is not disabled. I don't even know what that is. Let's hit where it says Google me to share your screen. Hit hide at the very bottom. What am I looking at? Where it says, okay, yeah, I'll just get rid of that toolbar. Okay, so on the PCR capture card, can you click details for me? Yeah. Okay, inspect views and active. What is, I'm not even sure what that means. Let me just see if that has anything to do with mine. I just want to see if there's anything different with mine. inspect view service worker inactive. Hmm. That's interesting because mine does not say that. Scroll down. Okay. On all sites, pinned to toolbar. Okay. Have you customized your extension at all? No, I don't know enough about this. Okay. I mean, I haven't done it. I haven't done it on purpose. you know what I mean there's always stuff going on behind the scenes with this computer but no okay here's what I want to do let's try just uninstalling and reinstalling the extension let's just see if that helps so if you hit the back option not hit remove extension here oh yeah you could do it there too okay go ahead and hit remove okay okay yeah okay so in your over at the very far left where it says chrome web store there you are okay got it chrome web okay okay okay type in pcr capture in that search box i think i did this i think when i was having problems i went to do this i wonder if i've got it on twice i feel like i did this at the end of last week when it started happening i somehow got to this area pcr capture and i feel like i did this so i wonder if i've got it twice on there or something? No, because it would be listed twice in your extension. Okay. Okay, let's click on that icon. Now open the page that we need. Click add to Chrome. Yep. Okay. It could be something with Chrome. Add extension. And that's the other thing, because this is Microsoft, a lot of times I'll somehow just keep defaulting away from Chrome. It'll try to default to Microsoft Exchange. I wonder if that happened somehow. Okay, so see with the black extensions icon, click on that. So what happened? It popped up and nothing happened. It didn't say install or anything. No, you added it to Chrome and it only popped up briefly. So click on that extensions icon because they don't automatically pin your extensions, click on it, and hit the push pin next to capture. Okay. That just shut it off, right? No, that just pinned the extension. So, see how we now see it at the top right? We don't see the Adobe one. Because they don't automatically pin it. Kind of like you have like your pinnable icons in Peace Recruiter. Yeah. Basically, same concept. Okay. Let's open a new tab. and go over to click on your PCR URL your shortcut there in your bookmarks okay I'm gonna have you copy this URL at the very top just more Lee group no at the very top yeah copy that okay click directly on the PCR capture extension at the top right and put your mouse in that field right click you might need to go over to the left a little more okay hit paste there we go and then hit paste that's your place it with yours okay hit login mm-hmm put in your PCR username I don't even know what it is your password select your database name hit login yeah I don't even know what it is I don't know what my password is anymore it just automatically comes up for me yeah I don't remember now I'm gonna have a problem because I don't remember the password yeah I don't know okay when I go in the PC all right so let's go up to a new tab yeah and type in Google password manager yeah okay and then choose that option and then click on that first option there okay hit that started okay so let's scroll down on this page where we find PC recruiter here's that okay hit the arrow mm-hmm and you're gonna have to sign in with With my fingerprint or with a pen? This is your Google password manager. So, okay. So, oh, do you go in as admin? No. I go in as my own. I mean, I'm the only one who works at the company. I don't know. I know there was a problem with a few months ago with the, texting to, it was texting, I'm talking back and forth with you, we never got it solved, but texting through the system, and I know they had me change some things to admin to figure some stuff out, but I don't think that's what I go in under. Open up a new browser tab for me, if you don't mind. In fact, I know I don't. Yeah, I know I don't, because when I enter an activity, it says Jim next to it. What? A new browser tab? Okay. Yeah. and then click on your yeah see it's Jim username Jim and then there's the password I just don't remember do you use Google for your home and your work yeah okay maybe it's in here then let's go to three vertical dots say that again do I use Google for my home and my work emails no I use Outlook I use Outlook Okay. Let's go to your Google picture at the top right of your browser. That was the same one. Okay. I mean, I have a Google email. Let's try passwords and autofill. okay let's try google password manager here maybe this is going to give us something else okay there we go now we're getting three accounts okay let's go to that arrow what is going on okay scan okay now let's look for okay here's the one there's two for jim let's see click on I'm going to guess the most I'm going to guess the last one is probably the most recent one let's put the eyeball in the password field on that last one okay I think that's what I guess put in there but let me back I don't even remember where it is now where Now the other one's capitalized, so maybe it's the other one. So let's go look at the other one too. Let's look at the one right above it. We're going to have to try one of these two. Hit the Google thing. Same one, okay. Okay, so I think the difference is just one's capitalized, one's not. Why do I have the admin one? Why do I have the admin one? Admin is like what we have in your database when you first get your database because that's what we use to go in and create your username, but it's also like a backup way to get in because if you accidentally delete your username, you can go in that way. Okay. Okay, so we know it's next 12th floor. Okay. Okay, so let's click on the PCR capture extension again. Oh, you left the meeting again. I left the meeting? Yeah, you closed the meeting window. all right sorry about that that's okay and then you have to do the share screen get an option okay can you see that yeah so we want to keep this meeting window up even though we're not really in there so let's go over to a different tab maybe like that fourth one that says PCR capture okay let's click directly on the extension at the top right yes yes click on that okay got that part let's hit login. So put in Jim, that password, and the password is case sensitive, so make sure you don't have your caps lock on. And there. Okay. All right. So see what says capture the default company. Let's turn that option off. Okay. Then exit this PCR capture window. Did I do something? Did it just edge it? I didn't even do it. I think you're okay. Let's go over to a LinkedIn page. Let's see if we have any better luck now. You think I should log out of LinkedIn and log back in? We kind of did just close it. We kind of did just close it, so it should be okay. But it automatically logged in for me. that one. Yeah, no, it shouldn't be that. Okay. Yeah, no, not working. Okay. I wonder if I have some just maybe pop-ups. Let me see. Let's go to the extensions icon again. Can I close some of these out or this is getting a little messy? Yeah, just not the meeting window. Okay, so close extensions. Close this. Close this. Right? Yeah, just not the meeting window. All right. Got it. What do you want me to do? Go to extensions again? Yeah. PCR extension or the plug-in? Just the extensions. Okay. And then go down to manage extensions. Yeah. Go down to PCR capture. Yeah. Details. Okay. So now we set service worker. Looks the same. Okay. On all sites. That's right. Okay, what else could it be? Okay, let's go to the three vertical dots. Well, if when I hit refresh, then it works. There's something that it's not. It's not, when I go to LinkedIn, it's not knowing I'm there. Do you think there's something on the back end that they're doing? Possibly. I mean, it doesn't happen on my computer, so it's kind of, who knows what, that's kind of a little process of elimination here. Let's, okay, let's go down to, in here, let's go all the way down to settings. settings i don't see settings yeah you got it go into it yeah okay let's see what could be Let's do privacy and security. Where's that? Over at the left. Got it. Okay. Okay, I'm just going to kind of see what we have here that might be a little bit different on mine. Has Chrome found some safety recommendations for your review? No, it should not do. I don't think it's going to be that. Okay. Third Friday Cookies are at LabCon. Security. Go to site settings for me. So all the way down. I wonder if it's this last option. See where it says pop-ups and redirects? Click that arrow next to pop-ups and redirects. Choose instead of don't allow Check allow Okay Let's scroll down a little bit more Okay So there is no save Okay let's hit the back option Okay Up at the top left right here yep okay let's close this tab the settings and privacy security tab let's close the extensions tab let's go back to linkedin now we're going to have to reload here but then we're going to try to go to another page and see if this has any effect so if you try the the reload refresh icon that to get it for him. Now let's try going to somebody else. Same thing. Doesn't work. And it's not just going in that way. It's if I enter anyone. I mean, if I enter anyone's name, it's doing the same thing. Like I enter his name, I click on him. Let's try it. See over at the top of LinkedIn where it's got, I don't even know how to describe the icon. It's just directly left of the LinkedIn URL. So it's right after that reload. Okay, let's click on that. They're allowed. Let me see if I go to LinkedIn. This is my network. We went to somebody. Hmm. You know what? Hmm. I wonder if it's just starting from... Mine's not popping up either now. I wonder if the path we're going, let me try a couple. Yeah, that's why I just put it. The path I took to go into new connections and then click on it wasn't working, but even just going to the search bar and putting someone's name in, it's still not working. See what I mean? like it's just not pulling it up ever unless I hit this refresh button that's the only way it's doing it and I know that I've never done that before I'm going to try something in my LinkedIn before I have you move around even more. Let me try something here. Okay. I must have done something or my wife. Make a connection. My network. I wonder if they changed something with their URLs even The only thing I can say is we're going to have to have a developer look at it. Okay. Because sometimes there has, I believe there has, oh, now that one changed. So LinkedIn.com. So that one finally popped up. I remember this happening a couple years ago. You guys had to do an update. Yeah. So the problem is, is like when LinkedIn makes changes, because our extensions, it's not an integration. you can't you know linkedin's not going to let you write with an integration with them unless you want to pay a whole bunch you know how they they wanted their money um so what our extension does is it reads the page yeah and so if they're changing something back in the back end of their code that could be causing a problem because i'm going under more profiles for you and these seem to be okay, but if I go to my network and go to connections, the reason it might seem okay with other profiles is because they're already in PCR and maybe because these guys are not in PCR. That's why it's not. I'm not sure. if I go to Brandon Cullen see I click on Brandon Cullen yeah but it should load I mean yeah it is going to do a check but I wonder if something about or is it just taking really really really long to load like really long to load like something tapping the background because I feel like that Ryan Sardinsky that I clicked on nothing happened and then I wasn't paying attention and when you were talking I looked and the update thing was there again. Or maybe I hit refresh. I don't know. Yeah. No, I'm thinking something in the back end changed. Like it doesn't really know that you're on that page to pop up until you hit it. But that's – I'm not sure what it is. So as they work around – as they work around, the thing is if it doesn't pop up is to reload. But I'm going to have to like submit this as an example to our developers to be reviewed. because it could just be something in the back end, like a change to LinkedIn that is maybe causing it to net load because I don't know what else to kind of recommend. We've looked at a lot of different settings. We tried a bunch of different things. But it's working on yours. It's working on yours. Well, not when I go to my network and go to connections. That area, when I'm starting from there, well even if i just put it even if i just put a name in the search bar like right here like ryan like ryan stars in who i've been connected to for a long time i click on him it's it's not pulling it up there either it's not just going into my network it's yeah it's inconsistent and it's now happening to me too so sometimes what happens is even when linkedin does roll out changes because I have not noticed it until I'm just trying it now. Have not had any issues with it. Yeah, you may not. Sometimes what happens is when LinkedIn does do changes, they're rolling them out slowly. Like they might send it to a batch. And then it could be that they've changed something. So we're going to need to do testing and stuff on our side. Because I don't know what else to do other than have somebody look it up. Yeah, just keep it open and let me know. Yeah. All righty. But at least we have a workaround. around if you just hit that one icon at the top left at least that's forcing it to pop up yeah so it's almost like it's not recognizing the page being load for us to even pop up and that's what yeah actually yeah exactly all right so I'm going to make some notes I'm going to submit up to our developers I don't have any more information for you right now at this point yeah okay that works okay all right thanks thanks for help no problem have a great week uh have a great fourth yeah you too you too",
