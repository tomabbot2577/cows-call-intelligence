    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, Sandy Bishop with the Bishop Group. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. I have a quick question. Yeah, how can I help you? I think I'm losing my mind with PCR. I was trying to look up on my database, my PCR database, the number of companies that make terminal blocks that are headquarters companies. And by the way, I code all my companies' headquarters if they're the main office and the products they make. Okay. So when I do a search for that, I'm getting 7,000 companies. Are you there? Yeah, let me take a look here. So they have like headquarters in the name. Yeah. So, for example, I go under company on PCR. Mm-hmm. And under keywords, I put in headquarters, right? Because that's one of my keywords. And then I go and, right? Yep. And then parenth or what do you call them? Quotes. Quotes, terminal, terminal blocks. By the way, my guess is there are about 30 of these in the world. Okay. So now I do a search, right? Yep. So when I did that, I got 26 results. Well, I just got 7,008. and eight. Let me go back. So in the block below state, what do you do and was it all capital letters? No. That's the key there. When did that happen? So anytime you do the ands because you're on of the Lucene searching database. Yeah. Like the and or ors, like to differentiate, you have to use capital, all capital. I never knew that. Yep. I think it used to work without that. It did on like keyword version two, but with the Lucene searching index, which is a better searching index. Okay. This helps you be able to use those types of words. let me just try this real quick okay so now I got 26 that sounds more like it so I have one other question yep when I get the results to the right of I want to action it says score what does score stand for? so the score is just telling you where it's finding those keywords so like KB in the keyword section and the higher the score, like it'll be full matches up at the top and then like partial matches down further. You can actually click on that K and it'll show you. Click on the K. All right. It'll show you that, oh, it did find them in that keyword section. So where else might I find it? In the body of the candidate activities? So since you're doing a company search. Yes. Let me just pull this back up. So K means keywords. A would be attachments. P would be a profile if you had it attached. Okay. S would be a summary and N would be a note. Okay. So it looks like you have one that has an attachment that has one. Gotcha. All right. What if I don't care about score? Can I take that out? So anytime you do a keyword search, that's going to be in there no matter what. Okay. It's taking up a lot of space there right in the beginning. Well, you can always select the results and then add them to a roll-up list. Okay. Okay, got it. And view them from there. All right. So and or should be capitalized. That's the answer. Yep. Tyler, thanks for that. Not a problem. It was driving me crazy this weekend. No problem at all. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yep, you have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye.",
