    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Eric Rudd. How are you? Good. How are you, Eric? Good, thanks. So I have a couple of issues happening right now. One of them is invalid email credentials, and the other is a question or two about building a roll-up. yeah let me pop in and take a look here okay Len do you use the admin username I'm sorry what was that what username do you use when logging into the database admin yes I think okay perfect alright let me take a look here okay all right so yeah it looks like we just need to reauthenticate your email alias okay so hey can I I'm sorry I've got a medical caller right now can I ask you to just hold for one second please yep okay I'm sorry thank you so much all right sorry about that. Oh, not a problem. All right. So, for the email alias, you're going to go into PC Recruiter, you're going to go to System. Okay. Let me get there. Okay. System. And then Email Setup. Email Setup. Got it. And then you click Email Alias List over on the right. Okay, email alias list. Okay, for me, that's from the left, but I got it. Okay. And then you'll click the little pencil that you see next to your email alias. Since you're using Office 365, you'll just do that sign in with Microsoft option. Okay. You'll just follow the prompts, or if you already have the cookie stored, it might take you just straight back there. Yep, it took me straight back. Okay, perfect. Now go ahead and hit test connection. Okay. And if you see at the bottom, if it says status in green and says test completed, you're good to go. Okay, great. So you'll just exit out of that test connection box and just make sure you hit save when you're done. All right, very good. Thank you. Yep. And then what did you have a question about with the roll-up list? Yeah, so, you know, I want to build a roll-up, and I might need to share my screen with you because I have a couple of questions, if we can do that. Yeah, let me get this started here. I'll email you over a link. So go ahead and start describing it while I get that together. I can kind of get a game plan. So I've noticed a new way to possibly build an email, a roll-up, jeez. You know, towards the upper right of my screen, I see that search window. And, you know, like I can pop some things in there, like estimator. And it will bring up every estimator. I have 672 estimators in my database. Can I just grab all of these and throw them into a roll-up? Not from the quick search, no. Boy, that would be so convenient. Like, to me, building a roll-up seems very technical. And I'm just saying this for a suggestion. This would be great. So that's why we still have the main search functions like the basic and advanced searches. The quick search is designed, it runs differently than the regular searches. So it's not designed to have that kind of capacity. Okay. All right. I just got your meeting link here, so I'm going to click it. And then I'll let you in here. Then you can just hit continue without audio since we're on the phone here. Okay. So how do we? You can just exit out of the. You can just exit out of the. Okay. Yep. Got it. Then at the bottom of the meeting window, you'll see a blue box with an arrow in it that says share. Yep. And then you'll want to share your entire screen. So you'll click on which screen you want to share, and then you'll hit share again in the pop-up box. Okay. So entire screen, and then... Share's not lighting up for me. Still gray. Do you have the screen that you want to share clicked on and highlighted in yellow? No, I see. Okay. All right. So now I can share that. Okay. Yep. Perfect. Now I can see you. All right. Okay. All right. So essentially, you know, like I said, I was doing this over here. estimators brings up 672 would be so awesome to just pull those over, but I know we can't do that. So, you know, I want to build a roll-up, and I was looking, because I don't do this much, and I just kind of forget. How do I get rid of this over here now? Okay, it's gone. So, I kind of need some help building a roll-up, and I know you just go into name and then advanced searches and then I think like I've built some in the past so I can see all my saved searches here. So I was kind of using. I think I'm on the other PCR screen I think that you have open. Oh okay. All right. Let me. Are you in this one? Yep. Okay so let me get out of that. So I know you go into name and then advanced. And so advanced. And then, like, I know I have some saved searches here. But to me, it always gets a little technical here as to the best way to build this here. Whoops, that's not what I wanted. So, you know, like if I select, are you still there? Yep. Okay. Somebody else, I left a message for PC Recruiter, so they're calling me back. I'm just going to decline that. Oh, yeah. That might be Garrett. Yeah. I'll let them know. Okay. Thank you. So, like, I see over here, like, if I look at this one, this is one that I built. I probably had help building this one. Like, I don't know what all of these percentage and all that stuff means. But if I look at another one, if I go into, say, searches and, like, field engineers and then select, you know, here I just used the keywords. What's the best way to build it? Like, right now I have three titles I want to search for to find candidates with this title. so when you're doing a keyword search that will search things that aren't field level information in the database so like the title field on a name record on the edit name screen the keyword search doesn't search there it searches things like the resume attachments the summaries things like okay When you have the other search, that was searching field-level information. So if you know you want to search the title field, you'll want to do... Yes. Yes, that's what I want to do. And you said that's just three different ones you want to search? Correct. All right. Now, is it like an and a search or an or? so meaning like it's or okay so i'm gonna this one's going to be super simple for you great should i start a new search yeah click where it says basic we can do this with a basic search okay now where it says first name go into that drop down and we're going to select the title got it so you were mentioning that percent sign before yes what that's known as in pcr searching terms is a wild card and what that does is it kind of expands your search a little bit so let's say i wanted to do a search for any managers in my database and i just put in the word manager. What that search is going to bring back is just titles that start with the word manager. Okay. But if I put that wild card in front of the manager, now I'm going to be able to find all my service managers or department managers. Got it. So that's why we put those wild cards. So for yours, if you were looking for like an estimator, it would just be the ones that start with estimator. You could have like a lead estimator. So that's why we're going to put those wild cards in front of there. Okay, great. So go ahead and start with the first title that you were looking for. So right across from that title box, we're going to put percent sign. Okay. And then no spaces, the first job title. Okay. And then put a comma. Okay. And then percent sign. Percent sign. The next one. Okay. That would be so if I do like I want to do SR estimator so oops I got a mistake there so SR do I need to put a period or how you know I don't a lot of them may not have a period you don't even need to put in senior estimator because you're already going to get that with that wild card estimator All right. Got it. So I'll take that out. And then so the next word would be pre-construction. Like this, whoa, that's an O. I need a P there. Pre-construction. Let me make sure I've got that spelled right. Pre-construction. So what I want here is like director of pre-construction, pre-construction lead, vice president of pre-construction. So the percent sign covers that. Yep. So go ahead and hit search. Okay. Oh, there's one other thing here. I want to make sure they're candidates. Oh, okay. We can adjust the search here. Did you hit search already? Nope. I just did now. Yeah. Okay, so go ahead and hit that big basic search up at the top. Okay. Got it. Because that will take us back to our search. So where it says last name, go ahead and there and go to status. Okay, status. Got it. Status or status drop down? Do status drop down. It just makes it a little easier. And then we're going to select candidate. Candidate, okay. Okay. Yeah. Can I add to that too? So not in the dropdown, because the way the status field is set up in PC Recruiter is it's set with a single letter code. Okay. So if we do the regular status field, we could do multiple. All right. Let me go back and change that. Okay. So status. Yep. So C, what other ones did you want? I believe I have it as hiring authority. So that would be H. Okay. So you do C, H. C, H, no space? Yep. Okay. And the caps don't matter? Caps are small? You'll want to do it as a capital. Okay. All right. So got it. I think we're good then. Yep. So go ahead and hit that search. Okay. Search. All right. So take a look at those titles to see how you're getting the director of pre-construction, the senior estimators in there. Yep. Yep. It looks good. Are you seeing that? Yep. Yep. Yep. Looks really good here. and then I can let me ask you this. So I want to bring all these into a roll up. I know how to do I know how to create a roll up. I mean, it's pretty much just select all and then roll them up. Right. Yep. So if I were to go all results and then I could go over to roll up names. Yep. OK. and then you can either create a new, yep. The ad roll up to create a new one. Yep. Okay. So this would be, yeah, the name's going to be a little, the name part has a character limit, but then in the description you could put the, okay. The like big long description of it. Okay. So let me ask you this, because I like to – so I'm just going to save that so we know that that is saved now. It's adding the names. But now I want to manually scrub this a little bit just to make sure I'm not sending an email to the wrong person here by mistake. Is it best to scrub before you create the roll-up by unchecking, or is it best to create the roll-up and then – I know sometimes if you check, how did it work? If you check a whole page and then you click one to remove, it removes the whole page. Like it removes the checks for everybody. So it's like the remove all. What I typically say to do is like if you're going to send out a bulk email, you do the select all results and you uncheck one. Yeah. it'll uncheck everything because you've not selected all anymore so what i would do is just go through the list first okay you because because you can remove people from the roll-up list yeah okay all right remove them from the roll-up list first before you do the select all Okay, so look, if I wanted to, let me just say I select this page, and I want to just move this guy, I can do that. Yep. Right? Yep. But it's... Go ahead. You have to be careful when selecting pages, though, because if you go to the next page, it'll hold those selections. Okay. So it's just something to be aware of. All right. So is it best to just go select all results? Well, then when you do all results, it's going to uncheck everything if you unselect somebody. Yeah. Okay. So that's where I've always had an issue with this. Yeah. So if you do current page and then unselect the ones that you don't want, you can keep going through the pages then and then just selecting the page, taking out who you need. That you'll be fine. Okay. Got it. But you kind of just have to filter it page by page. Okay. All right. That makes sense. All right. I think I got it then. The roll-up is built. it's saved and we've taken care of the credentials on the emails. Yep. You should be good to go. All right, Tyler. Thank you so much, man. That was big help. Yep. Not a problem. You have yourself a great day. All right. You too. Have a good one. Bye.",
