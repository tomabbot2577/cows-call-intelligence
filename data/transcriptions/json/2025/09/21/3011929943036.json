    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Hello, Paul. Do you hear me? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? I do. I do. I bet since you're on a phone, it probably overrode the call and just put you in the Zoom meeting. So I dialed into the Zoom meeting. That's no problem. Okay, so we're good to go. I can hear you. And at this stage, hold on, let me go back. How can I get out of this chat? Okay. Perfect. And you see my screen okay? Oh, I don't hear you anymore. Oh, you're muted. Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect. So this is PCRM. So this is the new interface, the new product here. It is going to run off the same database. It's just going to look a little bit different. So I'm going to go ahead and get logged in. And if you have any questions, just jump right in as we go. Can you hear me now? I do now. Yeah. Okay, good. I can hear you. still going to get me to all my people it's still going to show me the most recent number of people that I looked at each one of these records if I click their little circle icon there that'll slide it in from the right-hand side of the screen and that's going to give me my custom workspace I'm gonna see all my activities or my notes or what roll-up lists they're on or anything of that nature so I'm going to be able to look at all of their information and these tabs across the top that you see kind of replace the buttons at the top of the current PC recruiter the current PC recruiter record okay so okay um you're going to have a customizable workspace too so you can kind of design a basic workspace there so you can do that there but so same basic data just a little bit different format a little bit fresher of a format we've added some things like the ability to edit inline Hello? Okay, so I can go through and I can edit in line. I can contact them from here. I can add an activity, a note, add them to a roll-up. So the main screen is a little bit more configurable and interactive there. Okay. Some of the screens are going to look pretty similar, though. Like the schedule looks very similar. you're going to have your calendar at the top you'll be able to see any scheduled items on the bottom that's all going to look and work just the same but your roll-ups are going to look a little different so you're going to be able to look at the roll-ups here and I can see here's all my lists I can see names companies positions I can also click into any list right from there and then I'm going to be able to open the list right from there okay okay so those are going to look a little bit different now one thing that it adds is that deals pipeline it was mentioned on that pop-up when we logged in the deals pipeline is going to be almost like the interview pipeline you used to track interviews but it's going to let you put in a potential deals so you can put in various different companies that you might be working with and then you can move them through step by step as you're you're selling them you're closing the deal you're sending the contract whatever it might be and you can even schedule activities so if you wanted to put a call and then an email a couple weeks later, you can kind of set that up in that capacity. So you do gain... And that's automated from email? Excuse me, I'm going to interrupt as we go along, or do you want me to wait and then ask questions? Please jump right in. That's no problem. Okay. So at this stage, just so I understand, so when you're scheduling these, like the email, you can set up, write the email, and then schedule it to be sent on a specific day, and then it will automatically be sent? I think in this list, I don't think it's quite that automated. I think it just reminds you so you would go to it and then send the email there. That being said, you do have some sequencing automations. So you could design a sequence assigned to a roll-up list that would, as soon as you activated it, would send an email. And then maybe you could say three days later, send another email. and then if they reply to it, maybe add on my call list, but if they don't reply, send them yet another email in four days or something like that. So you do have the sequencing piece, so you could actually go ahead and build an email sequence in here. So if I go up to my templates, I can look at like this business development template here with branches, and I can go ahead and I can go pick my first form letter, and then I can say if they reply to it, they're done. if they don't interact in three days continue to the next step which is add them to a call list or maybe like if i make a call and leave a message that'll move to the next step which is another email so these sequences are going to be automated like drip campaigns and it might this one includes a call but they don't have to it could simply be send an email wait a week send another email wait two days, send a third, something like that. Okay. And the email, so the email functionality is more developed, right? And that's, is that part of the regular PCR? Like if you would buy the additional stuff, is that $20 include, you know, being able to track emails? Because that's one of the biggest issues I'm having with the PCR is, you know, because we don't have that extra functionality, I've been using another, you know, campaign or kind of email program. so I can auto-resend reminders, follow-ups, and also it tracks whether the person has answered or not or whether they've actually read the email. And if they haven't read it, then I resend an email as a follow-up. You know, please read this email. Does that functionality come with? Yes, it comes with the PCRM, but it's also part of the premium package, which is an additional $500 to set up an additional $20 per user per month on this version of PC Recruiter. So this version that you're using, you'll see the same sequencing can show up in there, the exact same screen, the exact same templates. But you're also going to have, if you add it to either version, the ability to go into analytics, and then you can look at all the email campaigns or sequences you sent, and here you're going to be able to see opens, clicks, replies. You can go down here and see who clicked what, how many times. You can look at opens. You can see who opened it, when they opened it. So all that data is collected in there very easily. And that's part of the premium upgrade, which is available with PCR9, but it's standard with PCRM. And the screen, if I go into the PCRM, the analytics is just the same. So you'll see it was designed to look exactly the same in both places. So if I look at my email campaigns. Okay, super. So I don't know. Is there any way for us to purchase this and tie it in with the existing database? Or is that a no-go? Well, you could do that. You could purchase the premium upgrade to your existing database where you're working now, and that would just be applied and installed directly on the existing database. So you'd have all these functions there. Or you could even buy PCRM and install it there. So if you added PCRM to your existing, and it was, what was the name of the company? It doesn't matter. But the company you're currently using PCR Recruiter at now, if that company wanted to buy PCRM, it would just be $30 per user per month instead of $20, but the same $500 setup fee. So you could add PCRM with premium onto the existing PC recruiter you have now or buy a whole separate one for a little bit more, but that would set up a whole separate database and it would include PCRM and PCR9. So it would include both. So we could run this client for the same database. Some people could run this client and someone could run the other client. Is that true? Yes. It would share all the data. Yeah, but it would share all the data and all the database. So any actions I take, the people will be able to see everything I put in there, but I can use all the functionality without having to make everybody upgrade. Yeah, they don't have to. You'd have to pay $30 more per user per month, but if they don't want to use this PCRM version, they don't have to. okay but i'm just saying like for my my client could i go ahead and just use pcr crm and everybody has to continue with the other one are you going to want money from all of them well if it's an existing pc recruiter customer upgrading everyone has to pay the upgrade fee because even though they might not be using pcrm they could and it changes some things and it adds new features so it's it's for every user so just like you can't upgrade premium for some users you can't upgrade a PCRM for some, it's got to be for everyone, for the whole database. I thought I found a little loophole. I'm excited. Yeah, no, it's got to be for everything, unfortunately. All right, cool. Okay, no worries. Please continue. Sure, sure, sure. So, yeah, so you're going to have the ability to report on clicks and opens and unsubscribes and all of that, and that's going to give you a nice interface to do that. You're still going to have, of course, if you went in here, the ability to configure your records to look however you'd like. You can have your activities, your resumes, everything like that, and how we've designed it. This workspace is kind of your landing page, the first place you go, and you are able to configure that with different widgets, and you can show activities, maybe the whole resume, maybe some location information. You can pick what you want. The details is going to be every field you have on that person. Something I like about the details is if I want to get only my phone fields, I can just go right here and type in phone and it'll instantly search and filter down only phone fields. Or if I wanted email, it'll instantly filter those down. And then you can kind of move these options. Maybe I want to put like my resume right over next to my activities. I could just drag it right up here. It'll move right over. So it's a little bit easier. This is a little bit like Salesforce. I don't know if you've used Salesforce. Salesforce? I don't know. Yeah, it kind of has the same kind of thing where you can add the tabs and have different tabs open for it. Anyway, so that's cool. So, I mean, just so I understand correctly, I mean, is the intention here, I mean, this seems like this is where you guys should be moving for everybody, right? I mean, is that kind of the idea? Maybe, albeit slowly, because what originally happened when this was started a couple, three, four years ago. It was going to be a new interface for PCR9, and it was going to totally replace it. But what happened is, A, we added so much CRM functionality with the deals pipeline. We added a little bit simpler sequencing. We're coming out with some reporting and some DocuSign integrations for the deals pipeline as well, that we decided to spin it off as a separate CRM product that could eventually be its own separate product even for non-recruiters to utilize. However, we also found that so many people were so into using PCR9, they didn't want to change. They were used to it. They didn't want to upgrade. They didn't want the interface. They didn't want to replace. So we decided to keep 9 anyway and run them as two products off the same database so you could theoretically, as you asked, have one company. Half the people could use PCRM, half could use PCR9 and share in the same database. So it's certainly no problem. And that's not to say that maybe someday PCRM will become kind of where everybody heads over to PCRM because they like it better and it's got all the functionality and maybe that'll happen someday but for now we're running two products and people are free to use either interface now what the PCRM did have for a time the searching wasn't quite as strong we've just this week released better keyword searching boolean searching it didn't used to show you where the words were found when you did a keyword search, now it does. So that's been streamlined a little bit too. So PCRM does just about everything 9 does, but with a nicer, newer interface. But we're running both versions. We're not sunsetting 9 at all. All right. Listen, I already ran past your allotted time. So I'm going to ask you one more question. I think I've got a pretty good grip on it, unless there's something very important that you want to discuss with me. But on the searching, I just wanted to come back to that so this ai integration etc etc i know is that included in this i mean when i'm searching like for example i'm looking for a particular candidate that has a certain skill set and i wanted to go through and you know you know you got the lucent or lucent you know database and tools and keyword search and all that and i've tried all these different variations and it's hard to narrow down on you know finding a particular guy who's got a degree in mechanical engineering and he's worked with automation in in the cement industry right and uh i want to do a search for that and i right now i'm kind of like you know creating a list of people that are mechanical engineers and then i'm using that as a basis for another search for particular keywords in their resume has there been like any substantial development in that and narrowing down and going through resumes because they haven't filled out at least you know what i'm working with now they I haven't filled out a lot of the other fields, unfortunately. There hasn't been a lot of good data inputted. So I'm mostly relying on what's in the resume itself to determine whether the person has the necessary qualifications to apply for a specific job. So, yes, you can actually search resumes here. If I go to more filters, what I would do is I would do an all content search. So all content is going to allow me to boolean search. And then I can put in like sales and marketing. and if I run that search that's going to search back and return everybody who has those words now I don't have the latest version for some reason but the new version does show where it was found but what's nice about this is if I go through and maybe I look at Leslie here what I can do is if I look at the resume the new version shows the resume and highlights the words and I think I can go in see above her photo I could just click a little down arrow That'll go to the next person. Let me look at their resume. Click down the next person. Let me see their resume. So I can actually page through all these individuals looking at the resume. And soon, obviously, these people don't have a resume right now. But if I had resumes, it would load them, show the words highlighted so I could kind of peruse each one. And then if I wanted, I could add another option and something else or add another field search or maybe use a code radius or something like that. or I could put them all on a roll-up list and save them from there. Right. All right. Well, listen, is there anything else that you think I should see that, you know, distinguishes this from the PCR9? I've showed you the main things, the main interface changes, the new features there. All right. Well, listen, I appreciate you taking time going over this. And, you know, obviously I'm not the boss of that other company. So, you know, this is something that they're going to have to take a look at in terms of upgrading. But I was really kind of thinking, like, from the standpoint of me setting up a completely separate thing. So, basically, I kind of get the idea that if I want to set up my own database, which would be a zero database, because I wouldn't be actually taking it. taking over the existing database. What I'm probably doing is creating, starting to, you know, as I find new candidates, I'll be including them into my database. And then at the same time, I'll be logging in to the existing one and finding people and then maybe processing them via the PCR, you know, the CRM one, you know, so I could take advantage of the email and everything, which is included, right, in that price? Yep, everything's included in that price. Yep, and it will be a totally separate database. Okay, and in terms of AI? That's included. So that is included in here, the AI search, the content generators, and everything like that. So there's a summary generator that will generate a candidate summary. There is a job description generator. There's also an email generator. So it will kind of let you say, I want to have a casual tone, introductory email, and it will generate an email there for you there. There's an AI search that's being worked on. I personally don't like it, but if I go up into AI search, I can do like show me names in Cleveland, and it'll pull some results back. This is terrible at keyword searching, but it's good for finding field searches, people by location, something like that. So they're working on improving the AI search there, but that's included. It's all included there. Okay. Well, listen, I appreciate you. Thank you very much. Certainly. And either way, if you want to upgrade, if you want to go set up your own, reach out to me. Either way, I can do paperwork to make either or both. I will. I will. All right. All right. Thanks for spending time with me. I appreciate it so much. My pleasure. My pleasure, Paul. Thank you. All right. Have a good one, sir. You too. Bye-bye.",
