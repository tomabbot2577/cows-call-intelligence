    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, how's it going, Robin? I'm pretty good. Happy Monday. Happy Monday. I like that attitude. My name is Bill Whitney from BDA, and my company specializes in the settlement of merchant cash advance debt. I'm reaching out to confirm whether or not you guys are making any daily or weekly payments at this time. Are you? That would not be something that I would be familiar with. Oh, okay, because this is Bill Antos. It's like also accounts payable. But, Robin, tell me, do you still receive a lot of calls from different lenders trying to offer you guys money for your business? Yeah, we're not interested. Thank you. Yeah, because you happen to be on a list called the UCC. Are you familiar? No, I'm not. I'm a person here in support. Okay. Is there any way that you can direct me? And once again, if you can direct me to the accounts table or finance. No, we're not interested. Thank you.",
