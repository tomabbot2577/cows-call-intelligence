    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. This is Gina with J-Powers. How are you? I'm doing fine, Gina. How are you? I'm good. It's been a while since I called you, and your, what do you call this, automated greeting changed. Usually I just hit forward to get technical support, but it says that's an invalid, you know, number. I'm like, oh, okay. Yeah, we did just make changes to the phone system. Yes, we did. Sorry about that. Oh, no problem. No problem. You can tell that I haven't bugged you guys in a very long time. Well, that's good, I think. Yeah, it is. I think that's good. It is good. So I just need to pick your brain a little bit. So I captured someone in LinkedIn and put it in PCR. And then after that, I found all the information for this person in Zoom info. So I tried to click to update from Zoom info to PCR. And I noticed, and it's been a while, I've been noticing it, that not all the phone numbers that's being captured in Zoom is being entered in PCR. So should I talk to you about this or should I go directly to Zoom info and maybe they can help me with, I don't know if it's a, I'm not exactly sure the term, a coding issue or something like that? This would be in our, it's our tool, right? You're using the capture tool, the extension. Yeah. So that's our, that's our tool. Zoom info would be like, what, what are you talking about? They, yeah, they don't know. Okay. So the capture tool, the way it works is it's a bunch of code that is looking for very specific things on very specific websites. and we support the ZoomInfo website. So at some point in time in the past, a developer on our end went through and was staring at the ZoomInfo website and the backend code for the website. And then he made code specifically to look at this type of website. And over time, companies like ZoomInfo, they change their websites, right? So it could be that they changed some sort of element on the screen or they moved something or, you know, hid like some backend like element that the capture tool was looking for. And so since those changes happen, like the capture tool will appear to be broken because it's like looking for something that is no longer there. And that's kind of the, that's kind of the ebb and flow of how the capture tool works. It's kind of like, we'll make it work. And then over time, web developers of the target websites will change stuff and then it'll like slightly break. And then We'll have to like report that as a bug and then the developer will fix it and it'll work for, you know, another six months or whatever. And it's kind of like a ongoing battle of developers there versus developers here because they don't really like us scraping their data. Right. So they I think they do this sort of thing on purpose. Like every so often they like change stuff. So scraping tools of this nature don't work as well. Well, that's not good for us, the user, because, you know, we were like, oh, everything should be there. but hey, hold on. The business phone number is, it is captured, so I have to cut and paste it. So is there a resolution for this or do I just continue cutting and pasting? The best thing we can do if you'd like to get that to be working again is if I like hop on, maybe we hop on like a quick screen share. I would like to like walk through it with you and like see an example of it like not working and I'll take like a screenshot and I can make like a ticket and it'll say, you know, the capture tool on Zoom website, no longer see this phone field or whatever it may be. And then I can maybe fix it. But I do need to kind of clarify a few things because there could be like, maybe you have some really advanced setup and maybe you've oversimplified it in words. And so I kind of do need to see it to be 100% sure on that so let's do a screen share if you don't mind um no problem i usually just use meet.google.com and you can just go there as well m-e-e-t.google.com and then there should be like a box that you could enter a code it says enter a code or nickname that will be in the middle of the screen and third code yes let's go and the code is going to be 10 letters. So it's going to be P, W, S, V as in Victor, D as in dog, Z as in zebra, B as in boy. They chose all the letters that are hard. S, D as in dog, Z as in zebra. So again, fast. P, W S V D Z B S D Z. And then it should ask, you should ask to join the meeting, make sure to mute and like, you can also turn your camera off in the Google meet. You don't need to. Oh, what about the mute? We don't need to mute. In the Google meeting. Yeah. You don't need to talk. So you can mute yourself and hide your camera. And then I, okay, got it. You really, we're only just using the, like the screen share. The screen share. Got it. Okay. So I did all that. Okay. All right. At the bottom there should be share screen and then pick your screen and I'm just going to walk through. I might take a couple of screenshots of what's happening. Share screen. Okay. So share entire screen. Yes. You do want to go to the entire screen one. okay choose what to share with meet google.com chrome tab and then window tab or entire screen i would choose entire screen because i'm going to need to see more than just the one window probably okay so entire screen and then uh it's there's two screen if pick screen one or screen two whichever one you feel comfortable with sharing that's the monitor i'll be able to see what's happening on okay so i won't see anything outside of that screen okay so then um yeah so just go through an example uh of it like not working on show or like update Yeah, you can click to another tab. Infinity mirror is just kind of showing. Can you see it? Yeah, infinitely. Yeah, I can see PC Recruiter. Okay, fantastic. Do you see this candidate profile, John Francisco? I do see John, yes. Okay, perfect. So I captured John from LinkedIn to PCR. Let me put my Zoom info here. Okay. So, and then I captured all the information for John from Zoom info to PCR. And when I captured it, it's missing the business and whatever emails. So let me go back. So it's the business phone number in Zoom info is actually work phone. and then this actually bugs the hell out of me. So after capturing it from Zoom info to PCR, email address is actually personal email, but for some reason the email address for the business for John went to the email address personal, it should go to the email address work. And then some of the other, you know, for example, the personal email should go to the email address field, but it didn't go there. And then all this alternative number, I guess it, you know, it doesn't matter. We could cut and paste it, but it would be nice if this can be If this can go to, for example, a company cell or a home number. Yeah. So, yeah, I just want to find out if there's a resolution for it being more seamless for us. Okay. I need to catch up. That was a lot. Let me document everything that you just said. Okay. Yeah. I was like half documenting it. So, all right. So we have a couple of things. Go back over these notes. He's an agent. John Francisco. Let me know if you want me to. Yeah. Let's just, I'm going to recap kind of John Francisco. You captured him at first from LinkedIn, right? You use the capture tool, right? Correct. On John. And then, okay. So then he went into PCR. Then you found him on zoom info. And can you pull him up? I want to take a screenshot of his record on zoom info. I'm going to take a screenshot real quick just of your just the John Francisco and I want to really I just want to have a screenshot of all these like emails and phone numbers on the zoom info page so I could be like point to them in the screenshot and be like these aren't coming over or whatever all right yeah and then so you said that the business email goes to the primary email address field and that was like a gripe you didn't like that okay The Zoom in to business email went to the primary email address field inside. Yeah, maybe you should say it should go to email work because I think that's what we have it. The alt phone numbers do not go into PCR anywhere? So the personal phone number, which is the cell number, this one here, the personal one, actually went to the cell phone, but that's it. Other than that, all the other phone numbers, like the business and the alternate numbers, are not going to PCR. are okay okay okay so it's not finding those okay business and all business and alt phone numbers do not go into pcr excuse me um there can you go to john's record and pc recruiter and i just want to make sure can you go to the details tab it's over on the right it's probably i don't know it's i I don't know if you use the detail tab, but this tab, this tab is made to show all of like the custom field information. And it looks like, it looks like there's not, I was hoping maybe the capture tool, like, I don't know, put it in here under like zoom info, alt phone or something. Maybe it was like, could create an, uh, custom field or something, but it did not appear to do that. Um, Oh, actually, Oh, um, Sorry, that's under standard fields. Can you expand or scroll down and expand the additional phone and additional email fields below towards the bottom of the bottom frame there? Yeah. Okay. Let's expand those and see. Did they create like a phone field? No. Okay. I was just seeing if maybe the developer had like, if it finds an extra phone number, maybe like plop it in here, but it didn't seem to do that. And then additional email. Yeah. Okay, those aren't there either. Okay, I'm going to make a note. It doesn't... It appears that... Not a capture phone. Does not make some fields either. For these phones either. I guess and or the email addresses. Okay. Can you go to social networking too while we're here? One more down. No, it's the same type of thing. Yeah, right there. It does capture the Zoom info profile, and it does capture the LinkedIn profile. It does have a Zoom info profile. Okay, so that looks like it's working. That's good. Do you know if this ever worked in the past? Or as long as you've known that Capture Tool works, is that how it's always worked? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, so then this is just like after you've used it a long time, you just know it could be better. You just want it to work better. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I could add this as like a feature request. Because I don't think it's like a bug. I think that's just like it does capture the info, but it's kind of weird in which placement where it puts it. Yeah. Is there somebody that you wanted to capture on Zoom info? Could we like capture someone? Yeah, sure. Hold on. Somebody maybe that's like a new name. Yeah, yeah, manager, power, supply. Okay, hold on. I wanted to see if we can take a look at your actual capture tool layout. Okay, so let's do this. Okay, so this guy, I'm trying to manager, manager, okay. Okay, so Christina Wyatt is also from the same company. Hopefully. Okay, hold on one second. I just want to make sure. No, that's not her. Christina at Bend, I think. Okay, here. All right, so Christina Wyatt. Okay, and she's with Bend. Perfect. So she's a new one that I need to capture. Okay, so add here, review, and then I'm going to put her in the a roll-up called mid and then submit okay and then let me find her in zoom Oh, maybe she's here. Christina. Oh, yay. It's right here. Okay. All right. So she's already in PCR. Now I'm capturing all this information from Zoom to put in PCR. So I just click to update. Before you do that, could you pull up the record in PCR so we can see? Oh, yeah. And we can see the change of email and everything. Sure. Name. Christina. I'm going to hide this. Okay. Okay. So, yeah. There. Yeah. Is there somewhere you want me to go? Did the LinkedIn profile have an email for her? No. Oh, okay. It's usually here, right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Could you... Okay. You're saying that the email gets overwritten, right? No, the email I... If there is... The email is usually being captured in Zoom, not in... LinkedIn. Oh okay okay yeah so you just wanted to go to a different field I thought it was like overriding a value as well as that okay yeah I thought there was like two things happening okay so okay all right well then go over you can proceed then yeah with your capture okay so I misunderstood before no problem so click to update mm-hmm you'll see all the things happening here so no Oh, wait. What happened now? Okay. Oh, okay. It sees a possible match. If you agree that that is a match, you want to click on that, and it'll change that record. Yeah, so this is what one of you guys told me to do is that I still need to pick or put the company information and make sure that I click on it because if I don't, it will create a duplicate company. So that's what I've been doing. So I go here, make sure that's one, and then this is a possible match in PCR. So I just click it, and then I review. Okay. So now what I do is I want to be able to capture the picture that is already in PCR. So I just unclick this. Yeah. And then all those names are already in PCR. So I just unclick it. so this one I need that so I'm gonna right you keep that there because that's the zoom info blip on the right yep the location because it's already being captured in pcr so I just unclick it and make make that a one I already have her in a roll up and then I'm capturing or I'm keeping all the information that I already have in PCR. So I go here. I actually do not have the website address, so I'm going to leave that alone. And this, I'm just going to unclick it because I already have that information. And so after that, I think everything is all set. I hit submit. Okay. Okay, and then I go back to Christina and I just, oops. From here, how do I reload all the information? Because what I normally do is I click out or I go, oh, I probably, I can go here and then go back and then it reloads it. You can, I believe you can just click edit name. You don't actually have to navigate away first. I think anytime you edit name, it will refresh the page. You could just click on it. Oh, okay, perfect. Yeah. All right, so this is what happened. Let me go back to Zoom. She has a business phone number that was not captured. It went to zero places, okay. Yeah, and then the – this is the email, work email went to the email address, which is supposed to be – oh, there's only one. Okay. Okay. So this email here – It is marked as business, though. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That business email should go here to the email work, but it didn't. there are sometimes on the zoom profile this particular example there was only one email right sorry yeah yeah question that i changed so that means sometimes there are multiple and it will it mark it as a personal email um i'm not sure but but uh but the one that we did earlier for john had two emails in zoom but only one email was captured could you go to john's profile again actually i have a screenshot sure it did mark it as personal okay i do have a screenshot of that Okay, great. Okay. So if it's a personal email and, okay, so it looks as if it's pulling probably the first email that it finds and it's putting it in the primary email field. I think that your request is that you would like the tool to notice that there are more than one email and then be able to delineate like, hey, this is personal, put it into primary email. This is business, put it into work email. Correct. the feature is kind of primitive and you're just like too advanced for it and yeah that's that's totally like a reasonable uh suggestion and i could actually explain that in words and there's like a reasonable example i have one here that like i've taken screenshots and stuff along the way i have like john's record and i could like i could like point to it and be like hey look like this email didn't go to the work email field like could you make that work and that's like an easily explainable pretty reasonable uh suggestion so i could definitely write up a ticket um and like put it through the process of like hey a zoom info capture user wants this to work and you know like along the way maybe maybe it'll get prioritized and verified and made okay um but that's like the best i can do right now it appears that the capture tool is it finding like the first email and it's putting it in the primary email field that's probably just how it's being currently used. Yeah, and then the only phone number that's being captured is the personal is the personal not the business. Yeah, okay, yeah. I can write both. Okay, email and phone numbers. This is true for, okay. So only one phone number is getting captured and only one email is getting captured. Correct, yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's a reasonable, I could enter that as like a bug or, or I'll, I'll, I'll make it appear as if I think it's a bug. They'll decide if it is or not. Okay. Like technically. Either way, just let me know. Yeah. I can make a ticket in our ticketing system. Okay. Your name is Gina. Is that your real last name? Academia? Yes. Oh, that's sweet. Are you smart? No, I'm mediocre. You seem pretty sharp to me. You didn't have trouble getting the screen share going like a lot of people do. Yeah, I've been doing a lot of screen share lately, but believe me, I struggled before. Well, you picked it up. I'm teasing. Anyway, okay, so Gina, what company are you with? Just so I have an absolute sure. Oh, J. Powers. J. Powers Recruiting. J. Powers, sorry. I didn't get that. Yeah, no problem. All right, well, I can log the call. I can make the tickets. I think I have everything. Is there anything else you want to let me know or go over? I just want to make you guys aware of it. Thank you. Yeah, I'll make a ticket. You can, you'll get like a correspondence through the ticketing system, I believe, automated email saying a ticket was created for you. And then, like, if any, any updates on that, we'll send you through that ticket system. Okay. All right. And your name again? My name's Mackenzie. Mackenzie. Very cool name. Thank you, Mackenzie. Have a great Independence Day. Thank you. You too. I appreciate that. Okay. Okay. Bye. Bye now. Yep. See you.",
