    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. Christy Burgess with Financial Recruiters. And I am having a small issue that I think I can't fix on my own. Yeah, what's going on? Sure. So my emails and my Kevin Taylor, who's my CEO, he is unavailable right now, at least temporarily. So I just thought I'd call you directly. My email, I emailed all morning. This is when it's coming from PCR, like if I'm trying to send just a regular email from PCR to a candidate or a hiring manager, or if I'm trying to send a form letter. And it keeps popping up this. I rebooted, and then I had a test from my – now, my Gmail works, but obviously, I can't always just go into my Gmail. Well, my Gmail works fine, but obviously, so it's in PCR. It says, and then I had my team test it from internal. I can't email them back, but they can email me. It says, uh-oh, PC recruiter could not connect to your outgoing email server. Please check system, carrot, email setup, carrot, email alias list to verify your SMTP server settings and passwords. I emailed all day yesterday. So this happened about three times about a half hour ago. And my IP, kind of my internal teammate who's an IT genius was like, you need to reach out to them. I can't help you. So. And it's Christy Burgess. And I will tell you. Are you using the Alexander Raymond email when you're trying to send? Fry. The financial recruiters one. I'm not using Alexander Raymond. And I typically, I have Alexander Raymond, but my day-to-day is all to your financial recruiters. Thank you. Let me pop in and take a look. And I was hoping to sell this in a couple minutes so I can take a quick break soon if that works. And if not, then you and I can decide what to do. Yeah, let me try sending one to myself here. ANDREA MITCHELL, OKAY. AND LIKE I SAID, MY TEAMMATE TESTED ANDREA MITCHELL, OKAY. AND LIKE I SAID, MY TEAMMATE TESTED ANDREA MITCHELL, OKAY. AND LIKE I SAID, MY TEAMMATE TESTED HIS AND HAD NO ISSUES. AND LIKE I SAID, MY TEAMMATE TESTED HIS AND HAD NO ISSUES. AND LIKE I SAID, MY TEAMMATE TESTED HIS AND HAD NO ISSUES. AND HE TESTED ME AND HAD NO ISSUES, HIS AND HAD NO ISSUES. AND HE TESTED ME AND HAD NO ISSUES, HIS AND HAD NO ISSUES, AND HE TESTED ME AND HAD NO ISSUES, SO I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH ISSUES. AND HE TESTED ME AND HAD NO ISSUES, SO I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH ISSUES. AND HE TESTED ME AND HAD NO ISSUES, SO I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH ISSUES. AND I DID REBOOT PCR. SO I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH ISSUES. AND I DID REBOOT PCR. SO I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH ISSUES. AND I DID REBOOT PCR. I REBOOTED MY SYSTEM, AND I DID REBOOT PCR. I REBOOTED MY SYSTEM, AND I DID REBOOT PCR. I REBOOTED MY SYSTEM, MY WHOLE SYSTEM YESTERDAY. I REBOOTED MY SYSTEM, MY WHOLE SYSTEM YESTERDAY. I REBOOTED MY SYSTEM, MY WHOLE SYSTEM YESTERDAY. THIS JUST HAPPENED. Maybe in the next 40, but I've been on the phone for about 40 minutes, so I've been waiting to call you. Thank you for your help. No problem. So I just sent myself a test email from you and it came right through. From me? Yes. Okay. So go ahead and have me test something, please. What do you want me to do? Go where and let me test it again. So if you do. Is there like a yeah, is there like a test name record that you can send to? Oh, you mean because you'll see it on your end? Yeah, I can just send it to my Gmail. I can go into me. That's not in the system. Does that make sense? Yeah. Like in PCR mail. Yep. Yep. I'm going to do myself. Christy Burgess. I'm going to send it to my Gmail just so it's not internal. Test from me. Do you want me to copy you on this or anything, or you can see it go through? If you copy me on it, it's just, you could do tyler at main sequence dot net. Okay. And Tyler, is it T-Y-L-E-R? Yes. Main sequence dot net. Okay. Test from me. Okay. Send. of course now it works hold on so you should have received it let me check my gmail on my phone that would be weird do you think it just had a hiccup now it went to you but typically mine comes to my phone faster than it comes to my even computer and I'm not seeing anything. Yeah, I'm not seeing it quite yet. Okay, let me test my financial recruiters because I'm not getting it. Yeah, I just, you know, my phone always gets things first when I'm sitting here working. Let me try it again. But it didn't do the, it didn't do the thing that it did last time. Uh-oh. Oh, I just got it. Okay, I just sent it twice, just so you know. And it's showing it went through. Yeah, it's showing both went through. So do you think I just called you and it decided to be my friend? Possibly. Was there a specific email or specific person you were trying to send? Amy White, but I tried like three different ones. I was going to say, do you want to try sending it to Amy again real quick? Yeah, because I have to reboot everything, so I got to get back to her, but that'll only take a second. Let me test it, and then I copied my email, which now I have no idea where it is. So let me just try it. Okay, I will just... Okay. So do you think sometimes it just has a hiccup or something? It's just life? Yeah, I mean, anytime you're connecting to like a third party, like if their servers are having issues. Follow up to my call. I work. Let me actually. Oh, hold on. Now I've got a phone call calling. Hold on. I am sorry. This is local. I need to make sure it's not my kids. Oh, not a problem.
