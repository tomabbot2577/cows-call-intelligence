When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Hello, Scott. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just to circle back, confirm that I'm closing the NIT Solutions Database today. So I just want to make sure you're not using it. I don't think you are, but I just wanted to confirm. If you have any questions or you need anything more, give me a call. My phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thank you, sir. Take care. Bye-bye.",
