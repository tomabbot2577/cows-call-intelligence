    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, sorry, what was your name again? Robin. Oh, hey Robin. I'm just trying to get some help here. I'm trying to do a mass email or like doing a send out of bulk emails, but it's not... it's giving us an error and it's not reflecting on our Outlook sent items. Okay, and what is your name? My name is Clyde. Okay. And your last name? Pizarro. How do you spell that? That's P as in Paul, I as in India, C as in zebra, A as in alpha, R as in Romeo, O as in Oscar. Gotcha. With titanium RCT? Yep, that's right. Okay. Well, it could be a couple of things. that could be... How many people are you trying to email? Sorry, Robin. Actually, it's not on my account, but it's for one of our new hires. Her name is Kimberly Augustin. Okay. Yeah, well, I was going to pull you up so that when we're done with our call, I write down that you call in. But what is the username that's having the issue? And I'll check their settings. Sure, it's Kay Augustin. How are you spelling Augustin? K-A-U-G-U-S-T-I-N? Yeah, that's right. Okay. I did something wrong. What's the username? How do you spell it? It's K as in Kimberly. Augustine is A as in Alpha. G as in George. U as in umbrella. Okay, now I got it. I think I hit A-U. Okay, so let me see. Okay. So one thing, how many people are they trying to bulk email? That's one thing. So we have like a list of people. Okay. I think that's around 100 plus, but we're doing it by batch, so like 20 recipients every 10 minutes. Okay. But we just realized it's not reflecting on our end. Yeah, her username does not have an email alias set up at all. Do you know who hosts your emails? Let me look it up in the toolbox. Do you know if you're hosted by Office 365, Gmail, or other mail server? Looks like it's in Microsoft Office 365. Yeah, it's in Microsoft. Okay, I'm going to start the setup. It's really just got a display name and a from address, but doesn't have anything else. So let me save that, what I've done so far. Okay. Can you log in? Are you at her computer? Yeah, I'm in her computer. Okay, perfect. Okay. So go to PCR, logged in as her, and go to system on the main toolbar. Go to system. Uh-huh. And then go to email setup. So email setup. Yep. and then go over to email alias list. So what this is is per settings how to connect to the mail server. So we don't actually send emails. We connect to your mail server to do it. So once you click email alias list, you're going to see a card down at the bottom. Card down at the bottom, okay. Okay, click the pencil on the corner of that card. It's just giving me blank, Robin. It says here email alias list. Okay, so system, email setup, email alias list. And then at the bottom, once you click email alias, you should see a card. Do you see that? Okay, yeah, yeah, I see it. Okay, click the pencil on the corner of that card. And I filled out everything else as long as that's her correct email address. But what she'll need to do is click sign in with Microsoft. and then sign into her account. And what that does, it goes through like the OWASP. Okay, now we might get one error even if we do this. Once she's signed in, it returns back to the email alias and you'll see like a really long secure password. Hit test connection. Test connection. And do you see anything like SMTP is disabled for this tenant? It says test complete status screen. Okay, perfect. So exit from just the test screen, and then in the alias screen, hit save. And then let me know once you've done that. Yep, done it successfully, Robin. Okay, let me just double check here. Because with Office 365, sometimes what you have to do, So she can send from PCR. Now, did she also need to be set up for her incoming email, which I don't see. She's probably done either. Yeah, I mean, if you can help me out with that one, that would be good. Okay. Now that one. Yeah, she doesn't have it. Okay. So setting up the incoming would also, like if somebody replies to an email if they're in a database where it writes the email received activity. Okay. so logged in as her this part I can't really do too much I can only do some parts at the very top right of peace recruiter where you would have a user image there's a little gear icon that floats on the edge okay click on that and they'll pop up a menu and select email email okay okay so I'll do some of it but this step I need you to do up at the top left click configure all right And then click Mail Servers. Mail Servers. Okay. Okay. So this is where we're going to get the incoming stuff. So follow that in that bottom section, follow that Mail Servers option all the way over to the right. You'll see like a three-lined icon with a down arrow. And then choose the option Add. Okay. Okay. For description, you can call it whatever you want. My email, my Office 365, whatever you want to call it. Then where it says save sent email to sent items folder, change that to no since Office 365 does it automatically. Okay. And then the rest of the details, click sign in with Microsoft. Sign in with Microsoft. Cool. All right. Okay. And then save that. let me know if you saved it okay so perfect okay so what i'm going to do now i'll just do it for you um under email folders i have to go in there and what's the send folder what's the trash since different mail servers have different labels so i'm going to get that done for you right now all right thanks robin now getting the incoming the initial sync takes a while you may not seem until like much later today, but after that, it's pretty quick. Yeah, sure, no problem. But the one that we initially called out, we can use it right away, right? Yes, for sending, you can now use it. And then it's just the incoming is going to take a little bit. And then what I'll do, I'm going to, is it cpizarro at titaniumrct.com? Is that your email? Yes, Robin. Okay, I'm going to send you, I have it in a Word document. I'll just send you that. I'm going to send you a document. So if you ever have to do this for anybody else, you would have all the steps, including the ones that I just did for it. Oh, nice. Yeah, I was about to say that as well. Yeah, very helpful to have this. And I have it specific to Office 365. Okay. PCR mail set up with Office 365. Okay. All right. And that email is on its way to you. All right. Let me just refresh my inbox real quick. Am I taking some time, Robin? Yeah. Yeah. But I think that's going to be it so far. Oh, yeah. I got it. okay yeah so it's just the incoming will take a little bit but she can start emailing now you just want to be very careful with office 365 you know kind of words you're using in your email but also how many you're sending because it's very important not to exceed any kind of their limits you don't want to get flagged as spam or get your account blocked right thank you Robin you are welcome have a great week you too I appreciate it bye bye thanks bye bye",
