I wanted to give you a quick call follow-up on your inquiry through our website the other day. I think I sent some emails too. I hadn't heard anything from you, so I thought I would follow up. Just check in. Give me a quick call. Let me know how I can help or what I can do to show you more around PC Recruiter if you have any questions. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I'll also send you over another email here. Hopefully we can get something set up to speak this week. I'm out next, so trying to get something scheduled for the week. Thanks, Mike, for the interest. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
