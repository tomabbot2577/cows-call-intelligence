    "text": " Hey, can you hear me all right? Yeah, I'm going to merge the calls now. Okay. Hold on one second. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm so stumped because I can't, like, I saw from your notes where you can, like, go ahead and save it and it would still work. But. Okay. So let's see this. So we only got through the admin portion. Can you see my screen? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Teresa, let's just go ahead and try this. Logged in as him now. Log in as him. Okay. Yeah, let me just see if it really recognized anything that we did even though it doesn't look like we did it. This is so confusing. Sorry. Okay so here are the users steps here. So make sure he's logged into his Zoom app and then log into his Peace Referrer account. Did I forget to do something for you guys? Do I need to share my screen. Okay I am looking at WorldBridge Overview Team dashboard was that on your other computer? Yes, that's the other computer. All right see if it will let you overwrite it. I'm on Chris's computer. Go ahead and go ahead and try try to present let's see if it'll override it okay actually there we go can you do a new share though make sure you go over to entire screen so that we can see everything otherwise we're just going to see that one PCR window only. Hang on where is it? Where was that at? I don't remember. In the meeting screen hit stop presenting I believe is how it's going to be labeled. Because you are presenting oh Should be the same icon that you click to present. Oh, stop presenting. Yes. And then do share. Click it again. That's what I did wrong. Yep. That's what I did wrong. Otherwise it doesn't show up enough. Okay. All right. So he's got, is he in his Zoom app? Okay. I see the icon. Can you go ahead and open that up? Let's just make sure he's logged into it? So he's logged in here and then here's the Zoom app he's logged in here. Sure okay pop up notes go up here at the lower right. Can you try the see that at the very top right where it's got the gold number one? Yep. Click directly on that gold number one. I wonder if that's our notification. Okay. Click there. Click sign in. Click sign in here. So I think the stuff for the activity writing is why we're having an issue in the other area. Does that sound right, Garrett, from what you've seen before? Yeah. Yeah, so the setup process, it'll show something like application not found, which is kind of alarming, but it's actually supposed to show that until we get the activity writer working. Okay, so allow this app to use my shared access. Yes, right? Yeah, towards the bottom is a little checkbox there that you want to turn on. Then hit allow. Okay. I kept trying to do save, but then it would still say that you're like not authenticated. so kind of we're going to like half part half do that but then really just have the person do this it sounds like so technically it seems like there's some some false uh um setup it's like false negatives throughout the setup but um yeah we should so do i need to hit do this launch soft one no that phone that no no no that is old old old phone stuff okay okay that anymore that was like so basically we just need to test yeah now the problem is because we can we still have to get approved by their app marketplace from what it sounds like it won't write the activities that's what the application is that's missing and that's fine we've got we've got our guys are writing activities themselves and stuff so that's not a big deal and I can explain that to him. I just want to make sure that it's working. Do you happen to have me in there? I'm in a lot of databases because I've been around forever. Try Robin Montoni. M-O-N? Yes, and then hit search. Let's just see if I'm in here. No, I'm not. Okay. Do you have the company main sequence in there by any chance? Or any, just any name that you feel comfortable trying to call. Let's see if it works. Name sequence. Okay. Go to any one of those with a phone number. Oops. Okay. And go to the right of the phone field and click the phone icon. Oh, there it is. Hit the always allow, open Zoom. Yeah. And it should be passing it over. Oh, yep, it's calling. Okay. It looks like it's calling. Yay. All right. Excellent. Thank you, Gary. I got really hung up on what you're supposed to do in the user area. Yeah, it gives you a lot of messages that seem like you're not doing it right, but for now it just is, you know. I was thinking like you go to release portion and hit save, but okay. All right. well perfect we got it somewhat working that's all that matters yeah okay i'm so sorry about this teresa but thank you for your patience with me no problem i appreciate your help thank you so much you are welcome and thanks garrett for jumping in yeah no problem have a great rest of your day all right thanks bye you too bye",
