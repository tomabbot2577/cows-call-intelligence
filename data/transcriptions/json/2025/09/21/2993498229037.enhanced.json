    "text": "Robin. Hey, what's up? Sorry. Hey, no problem. Kevin Saylor, I talked to him. Kevin Saylor can kiss it. Why can he kiss it? Have you talked to him? Have you ever worked with him? Oh, yeah. He direct emails me all the time. He sent me an email. Actually, he sent something. I had one voicemail from him from 5 o'clock yesterday, and then he emails Nick saying nobody's on support. It's like, well, you literally called and hung up. Didn't even leave a message. Like, dude. He sent the email to me saying, what's going on with support? I can't get anyone. And I didn't see that he tried to do anything. Right. There's nothing. I'm like, Nick, could you call this person? And he just sent them to you, I guess. Right. But then I just called. I emailed him back yesterday saying, well, okay, what do you need? Yeah. I received a missed call from you, but no message was recorded. and did you need assistance? No reply. Yeah, so he's set up a new user. He's actually added a bunch of users, but we hadn't been monitoring it, so we didn't know. So I'm putting in a user ad ticket for him too. But his new user, he needs to, I think, set up IMAP, I think. He's saying like somebody did it before for him that getting the folders into PC Recruiter, as best I can understand, it sounds probably like IMAP, and then something about the API key to set up some caller thing. There's no longer a sign-up. They just kind of, yeah, they just, there is no sign-up for it. There is no API key needed anymore. They just kind of put in their database, they need username, password, that's it. I tried to get from him kind of what it was to at least gauge what we needed for him and to give him a touch to get him pleased. And I told him, I said, so you know, I said, maybe he'd been emailing Josh. I hadn't gotten any emails, but I said, Josh is no longer here. And he goes, oh, what about Tyler? I'm like, he's no longer here either. So he may have been reaching out to people that weren't there. So I said, we've had some changes, a little bit of reconfiguration. So we're still okay. And he was calm. I was like, oh, okay. And that's why he said he couldn't talk until after 1230 Central. and I said, well, I'll put in a ticket and get you the help you need and just chill and I said, if you need anything, call me or call the support team, whatever. Yeah, or create a ticket or leave a freaking message. There's a good one. Don't just call and hang up because, I mean, yeah, there's like caller ID on some of them, but, you know, I'm not calling back just because you hung up. Yeah, he's a nut. Yeah, but I knew nothing. But that was the second complaint I got from support not picking up yesterday. afternoon so i don't know what it was i was like yeah we're busy that's what happens when you have no liz yeah i kind of sorry but i kind of went through this still he's like well we need you and then nick wants you on support i'm like okay like i could only do so much i literally worked till like seven o'clock again last night i actually looked at the clock i'm like holy shit it's like it's almost seven i didn't even realize it was that late it's not like nobody I'm pretty kingling that any one of us are not working. We are all working our asses off. So I really don't want to hear from anybody about what I need to be doing because I'm really like treading water to keep up. I'm the same. And I think that if Nick would get his goddamn ass on the fucking phone, this would help. But he won't. Like he's saying, oh, we're so busy, we're so busy, yet he doesn't ever do anything on the phone. It's like you need to make time to do some phone, buddy. You don't need to manage three people. you need to talk on the phone like he should be on there taking calls too no it's just processes more hoops for us to jump to yeah to get through everything like i just just let me get my job done like i that's what i need help with yeah we need help we need another person on the phone and there's nick there who could talk on the phone he's driving me up the wall and he's now not assigning training tickets so dimensional search offices are freaking out going we need we're late we got to go training by the seventh what's going on and he's like oh I've been interviewing I'm busy they're gonna take a little long and I said well DS's can't take a little long so you need to figure it out and I got the ticket assigned it doesn't take that long to sign a ticket over you know that's all I think look at it and go name you don't need to tell me all the you it like you could have assigned it quicker than the excuse you typed up to me. Right. I, I, that guy, he's not good. He's very detail oriented, which is actually very good for if you want somebody to monitor, like him and James, like whoever gets into that role, like Stacey, not so much. She would just make lists and, you know, like, but I, can you call me on my cell phone? Can you call me on my cell phone? Yeah. All right. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Thank you.",

00:00:30,253\nIt's like, well, you literally called and hung up.\n\n17\n00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,539\nDidn't even leave a message.\n\n18\n00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:34,287\nLike, dude.\n\n19\n00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,838\nHe sent the email to me saying, what's going on with support?\n\n20\n00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,959\nI can't get anyone.\n\n21\n00:00:40,745 --> 00:00:42,140\nAnd I didn't see that he tried to do anything.\n\n22\n00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:42,900\nRight.\n\n23\n00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,018\nThere's nothing.\n\n24\n00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:45,958\nI'm like, Nick, could you call this person?\n\n25\n00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,640\nAnd he just sent them to you, I guess.\n\n26\n00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:48,489\nRight.\n\n27\n00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,092\nBut then I just called.\n\n28\n00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,558\nI emailed him back yesterday saying, well, okay, what do you need?\n\n29\n00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:54,409\nYeah.\n\n30\n00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,899\nI received a missed call from you, but no message was recorded.\n\n31\n00:00:58,244 --> 00:00:59,180\nand did you need assistance?\n\n32\n00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:00,177\nNo reply.\n\n33\n00:01:01,881 --> 00:01:03,490\nYeah, so he's set up a new user.\n\n34\n00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,507\nHe's actually added a bunch of users,\n\n35\n00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:07,473\nbut we hadn't been monitoring it,\n\n36\n00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:08,137\nso we didn't know.\n\n37\n00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,276\nSo I'm putting in a user ad ticket for him too.\n\n38\n00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:13,675\nBut his new user, he needs to, I think, set up IMAP, I think.\n\n39\n00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,888\nHe's saying like somebody did it before for him that getting the folders into PC\n\n40\n00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:22,431\nRecruiter, as best I can understand,\n\n41\n00:01:22,452 --> 00:01:23,573\nit sounds probably like IMAP,\n\n42\n00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:26,558\nand then something about the API key to set up some caller thing.\n\n43\n00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,233\nThere's no longer a sign-up.\n\n44\n00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,810\nThey just kind of, yeah, they just, there is no sign-up for it.\n\n45\n00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:38,920\nThere is no API key needed anymore.\n\n46\n00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:43,211\nThey just kind of put in their database, they need username, password, that's it.\n\n47\n00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,387\nI tried to get from him kind of what it was to at least gauge what we needed for\n\n48\n00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:50,590\nhim and to give him a touch to get him pleased.\n\n49\n00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,456\nAnd I told him, I said, so you know, I said, maybe he'd been emailing Josh.\n\n50\n00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,975\nI hadn't gotten any emails, but I said, Josh is no longer here.\n\n51\n00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,300\nAnd he goes, oh, what about Tyler?\n\n52\n00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,580\nI'm like, he's no longer here either.\n\n53\n00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,400\nSo he may have been reaching out to people that weren't there.\n\n54\n00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,097\nSo I said, we've had some changes, a little bit of reconfiguration.\n\n55\n00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,111\nSo we're still okay.\n\n56\n00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,419\nAnd he was calm.\n\n57\n00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,499\nI was like, oh, okay.\n\n58\n00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:19,519\nAnd that's why he said he couldn't talk until after 1230 Central.\n\n59\n00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,582\nand I said,\n\n60\n00:02:21,384 --> 00:02:21,585\nwell,\n\n61\n00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:25,614\nI'll put in a ticket and get you the help you need and just chill and I said,\n\n62\n00:02:25,715 --> 00:02:26,296\nif you need anything,\n\n63\n00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:27,198\ncall me or call the support team,\n\n64\n00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:27,800\nwhatever.\n\n65\n00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:30,459\nYeah, or create a ticket or leave a freaking message.\n\n66\n00:02:30,862 --> 00:02:31,600\nThere's a good one.\n\n67\n00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,877\nDon't just call and hang up because,\n\n68\n00:02:34,877
