    "text": " You're calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is David Burden. I think we spoke yesterday. I believe so. How's it going, David? Yeah, doing okay. Hey, so I tried to use your online chat bot or whatever. And so it said create a ticket. And it says, you know, if you're registered, which I am. My company's been a customer for a long time. You'll get an email. and I don't have an email and then I looked in view tickets and if this thing is creating tickets it's not letting me know so that's why I'm calling so I am in PCR I'm trying to do the ad candidate wizard and so I go to you know add name parse from resume and it says a window should have popped up and it hasn't. I've already gone through in the Chrome settings and clicked Allow Pop-ups, so I'm not sure what else I need to do. Now, you downloaded the PCR launcher, correct? I think so. It has stopped nagging me about it because when I first used it, it said you need to have a launcher. I mean I can I can go out to the login screen and do that again yeah because you want to make sure you have the launcher in a Java runtime environment installed that's what controls that pop-up box okay is when you want to yeah so I'm doing that now it is not popping okay so it's It's starting the launcher dialog, but before it even gets into that, it says Java runtime is not installed or outdated. So do I just click OK and go through the launcher, or do I need to do something else? We'll need to download the Java runtime environment first. OK. So let me grab that link for you. I'll email it to you here. OK. and are you on a PC or a Mac PC perfect All right. I'll just email that on over to you. Okay. So the Java runtime environment that we're going to download is Amazon Coreto. Just works a little bit better with PC Recruiter. All right. And then when you click on that link, it'll just start the download. And then once it's in your download, it'll show up. Oh, there it is. Okay, yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. That's what I was, because I thought I clicked it. But, yeah, okay. Yeah, I did see that Credo thing on your downloads, but I didn't recognize it. I'm like, well, I don't think we're using AWS. But, okay. All right. It's just a free Java runtime environment. Yeah. Because Oracle Java always keeps threatening that they're going to start charging people. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so it says done in the downloads. Do I need to do anything else? Yes, you need to run that file to actually install it. Okay. and I'll go through like the install wizard you might get a pop up asking if it's okay that the program makes changes okay there it is Okay, so it's installing. So have you had a lot of setup questions with people getting rid of non-compatible Windows computers? Yeah, a lot of people are getting new computers, especially that newer versions. yeah because mine was just you know we've hit the end of life for windows 10 and and my machine couldn't handle the upgrade so i'm yep especially this time of year it's when kids are going back to school and college there's always deals on computers and laptops yeah okay all right and then you'll want to do the same thing with the launcher when that the credo's done okay all right so I think I need to start that over okay yeah so it's not giving me the Java error and just typical yep install okay and then when you go to log into PC recruiter after that's installed you'll get a pop-up that wanting you to open the control loader they'll pop up like the top of your browser screen yeah you'll check the little box and say always allow and then hit open yeah okay and then it'll ask you if you to update the launcher you'll just allow that update And then once that launcher updates, you'll be good to go. Okay, hold on just a second because I'm... So there it goes. Okay, yep. All right, it's working now. Thank you. Yep, not a problem. All right. Appreciate your time. Yep. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
