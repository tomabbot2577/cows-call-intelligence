    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. AI is taking notes. Hello? Hey, Victor, Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Jim, give me one second. Jim, how are you, man? I'm well, I'm well. Just thought I'd give a quick call. It's been, I don't know, some couple of weeks, a few weeks, maybe a month since we spoke. and thought I'd just check and make sure everything's going okay with PC Recruiter, with the whole Dimensional Search team, with the new offices that have been coming on here. Just kind of check into it if there's anything you needed. No, so far pretty good. I mean, we've been really good. Robin and Garrett have actually pointed us the right direction on a couple of things that we can actually take care of ourselves, which is great. So, for example, the template. So the template that we're doing for all new BS owners, a lot of times when they get there and the owner opens up not the admin area but their user, we didn't see the template. But that was just easy as copying the template set up from one site to another. That's perfectly fine. We also did a lot of digging into the PCR template itself. Yesterday I had a workshop with my team, like a live workshop in an office. And, for example, the roll-up configuration, all that stuff, we can get that from templates. So that seems to work out super well. The only thing is how can we approach older owners that didn't have that template set up? Because I know we had a disconnect before that we had a bunch of owners roll out, but they didn't have that template. And I think we had it live, the template, before. For example, Christian Kelly, he's an owner from a couple of months ago, maybe even a year, or he's approaching the year. And I know he had templates set up, but it was never set up in his head. So I have my people do the exercise on the configuration of new fields and then the name record views so those fields can be reflected. just because they're the ones connected HiReasy and ZoomInfo to PCR. So we needed kind of those fields done. So I don't know if maybe your team can offer to do some of that setup itself as we call on, or what do you think? Trying to get that template into some of the older ones that don't have it? Yeah, it's just pretty much adding new record fields, custom record fields, which are going to be the HiReasy and ZoomInfo fields into the name record itself. okay let me check around see what they can do on that cool and dude it'll be awesome if I know Brian Denton's pushing a lot of people that are having issues with PCR to hey take a look at PCR oh we're doing it on a case-to-case basis I'm I'm a little concerned that I am gonna run to the point that there's more of them that are doing PCRM and I have no idea about PCRM and I know I have my user for PCRM somewhere in there but I was wondering if you have some time next week if I can do a poll with my entire my entire tools training team so they can see it and then we can start coaching on it yeah yeah well and we can show you also kind of how the the new simple sequencing kind of works even I think a little better than the roll-up stages because that's one thing I I talked with Brian Dunn. We looked at a demo, and there's no roll-up stages in PCRM, but the simple sequencing kind of almost replaces them. So, yeah, I think that would be a great idea. Maybe I could include James or Nick or somebody on there as well so we could all kind of hop in. Yeah, and we're translating a lot of people from the PCR stages to a very long, complex sequence. And it seems to work for a lot of people that are semi-tech savvy and to use some people that are a little afraid. So I think once we introduce PCRM to some of those, they're like, oh, my God, this is awesome because we're doing all right. For example, let me give you an example of this cadence, which is automatic email, phone call, phone call, LinkedIn, automatic email, phone call, phone call. And then as you go along, email and so on, like I think nine to 12 touch points. But when you look at your calls, instead of just connected no answer left message and remove from sequence, we're adding additional conditions which match exactly what you do with a roll-up stages like marketing not now, no interest, interest, things like that. And what we're doing is just creating branches. So those names end up in those roll-ups automatically as you press that button and you have that call. So I'm assuming Simple Sequencing kind of does that in the back end, but we're kind of creating it for everybody, depending on the cadence that their coach wants the owner to do. So we're definitely offering that, you know, I guess a la carte, because that's probably like an hour and a half session that we got to do. But we create those roll-ups, explain those roll-ups, create the steps and so on. so if you think simple sequencing might be like a good like replacement of that we would love to see it sure yeah yeah I think it would I think it would well yeah let me figure out who I'm going to loop in and we'll see about getting something set up next week to take a look around and it'll be it'll be it'll be semi-private because it'll be just Paul Lamar and Augustine alone so Dave Batiste and myself so pretty much just my team that does the training so we can take a look at it and see how we devise it or so on I don't know Brian Denton will still have also a demo with his team and so on. But whatever you want to do, that's perfect. If you want to, you know, just, you know, two birds, one stone, that could work out. But, yeah, we're super ready next week to take a look at it. I know John Bartz is pushing me to, like, dude, learn PCRM right now, become an expert. It's not as easy to become an expert in something overnight, but I know John Bartz and his charisma. So that's what I wanted to – it's awesome that you called because I was thinking about, hey, we need to do this soon. For sure. Yeah, I will coordinate getting that set up. I'll see who I can include on my end and then kind of start an email stream with you in the group, and we'll see about getting something set up. Now, anyone in your end from RDS owners that we need to take care of on the training side, have you heard? I'm kind of like throwing the question that you gave me right now to you, brother. As far as PCR, I'm – As far as PCR altogether, like any owners that are saying like, hey, I need to learn more about this and that, and maybe they're out of their 10-hour training that we can take care of? Not that I've heard from. I haven't heard anything from my trainers, good, bad, or otherwise. I know we did have one that just added it. Who was it? Some dimensional search office just very recently added PCRM. They were handpicked by Brian. They were very tech savvy. I demoed her. And I think it was, let's see who it was. Jennifer Stanhope, maybe? Yes. I think that's who it was. Yeah. Yeah. She's now called DataCare Talent Solutions. Is that it? Yes. I believe so. Is that or Megan Archie? One of those two. Let's see. I think DataCare Solutions is... Oh, no. DataCare Solutions? That's... Ooh. Melissa Hunsinger. Yep. The Amazon girl. Yeah. She recently added PCRM because she had Amazon experience. She's like, I'm pretty savvy. I demoed her. She's like, yeah, I think I'd like to do it. So she just added it at the last month. I'm not concerned. She's not going to need support from us as much, though. That's good. Yeah. That's very good. Yeah, but nothing else I've heard? Hey, Jim, now that I have you too, this just came up in my head. A lot of people are adding call logic. And call logic connects with PCR, what they call the conditions or whatever, which is the activities of PCR. Since I'm assuming PCR 9 connects to data logic as a roll-up, PCR should be the same thing, right? With data logic? I'll double confirm it. Most of the connections, the API integrations, none of the back end of the database changed. So all of that pretty much still works. But I'll confirm just to be 100% sure. All right. Yeah, that's pretty much it, man. Love our calls. To the point. Fantastic. Well, I will be in touch to get something set up for next week. We'll get that, and we'll kind of take it from there. And I'll also check on the older database to see about getting the custom fields and the templates moved over. All right. Thank you, sir. All right. Very well. Thank you. Not even talking about you. Bye now. Bye. Thank you.",
