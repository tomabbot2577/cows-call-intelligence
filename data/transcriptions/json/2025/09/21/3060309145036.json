    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Chuck Draper. I've got an account with you guys. And just wondering, are you guys having any server issues? I think for the last five hours, I've had some real slow change in screen from PC Recruiter. Yeah, we did have a couple customers report that. Let me gather some information about your database here. Let's see. So you're with Chuck Draper, MR, Quaker Town. What's your username in PCR? I think it's just C. Draper. Perfect. And who is your Internet service provider? Comcast. Comcast. Everything else on the computer seems to be working fine except for PCRecruiter. Good. Okay. And what's your location, city, state? Quakertown, Pennsylvania. Excellent. And are you using a VPN at all to access the Internet? A VPN, what does that stand for? So that would be like a, I'm not sure what it stands for, but it's a program you use to change your IP address on a like 10 minute maybe cycle. No, I don't think so. So people usually, oh yeah, usually. Gotcha. Yeah. People usually would say yes, I'm using it because they would have to have set that up separately. So it doesn't sound like you've got one that's good. Awesome. Okay. I think I have everything I need. And you said it's just navigating through records. It's really slow. It's just anything. Just going to schedules, names, trying to upload everything. Everything's just super slow. Even email out of PC Recruiter. Excellent. That is everything I need. I will create a ticket and escalate this up to our tech team and get back to you ASAP once they get that fixed for you. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thanks. Have a good one. Bye.",
