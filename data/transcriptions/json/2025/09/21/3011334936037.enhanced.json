I'm sure I have some time tomorrow. What I'll do is I will shoot you over an email, if that's okay, with some times that I have available, and you can pick. Actually, let's see. actually tomorrow I'm open anytime before four. So if you want to just either give me a call or send me an email and let me know what time I'll get that meeting invite over to you. And you can just forward it to whoever you need to participate on your side and hope you're doing well. I will also send this in an email too, in case that reaches you faster. Thanks. Bye.",
