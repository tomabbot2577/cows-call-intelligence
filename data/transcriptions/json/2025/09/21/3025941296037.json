    "text": " Thank you for calling MWork Search, an industry leader in engineering and manufacturing recruitment since 2010. For Cliff Rusnak, press 101. Thank you for calling Cliff. Hello, Cliff Rusnak. Hey, Cliff, this is Jason calling from Main Sequence Technologies. I got your voicemail, and I just wanted to follow up with you. Yeah, Jason, I appreciate the follow-up. So I'm using RingCentral, and it's integrated with PCR. And I know RingCentral has changed sort of their version of the app. and the text so the the app that i use in ring central is different from sort of like the the version i'm using when i'm responding to taxes or sending taxes sort of through pcr so i'll click on the name record i'll click on the cell phone it'll go into a text screen that pops up from ring central and that's like an older version is that still the right version or did they change that too. Do you know? It might just be a display window. As long as it's functioning properly, I wouldn't think there would be any kind of concern. Because it might just be a display. Okay. Alright. Do you know if there's any way I could figure that out? Because it's... The other window sort of gives me everything. This one just gives me the texting. Like, texting numbers, texting history, and so forth. I might need to look at exactly what we're talking about. Do you have time for a screen share? Yeah. And I can show you both of them. Okay. So go ahead and open RingCentral and go to video. RingCentral.com or? The RingCentral app on your computer. Oh, okay. Hold on. I got to figure out how to open that now. Here it is. Okay. Okay. Give me a second. All right, it's loading up. Okay. All right, I'm in there now. You're going to go to video and then join? Where is video at? Let's see. So which, is it under home or is it under like? You might have a newer version of the RingCentral app, but mine's on the left side. It says like a tab for video. Yeah, I got home users, phone system, AI, meetings, maybe meetings. Yeah, try meetings. Let's see, meetings, recording, webinars, meeting rooms. Gosh, more. There's nothing that says like join a meeting or anything like that. At home now. No, not across like the drive-downs. Try meeting rooms. Meetings. Yeah, I haven't seen the New Ring Central app, so I'm not sure how to navigate it. I'm not sure if I even have a new one. I don't know. That's not why I called. So it's got recording management, meetings, but under meetings, there's nothing. Webinars, rooms. Oh, rooms, okay. Meeting setting, webbing, webinars, downloads, reports, AI, phone system. I don't see video anywhere. I'm sort of clicking on everything. Yeah, I'm just going to email you a direct link to the meeting. That might just be easier. C. Rusnak at mworkssearch.com? Yeah. Okay. You don't want me to go to conference, do you? I see conference. I don't think so. Try this. I'm going to email this to you and just use that link to go in. Let me know when it's there. I'll sort of go take a look for it. Yeah, I got it sent over to you. You did? All right. Maybe it's in Outlook quicker. Let's see. There it is, Jason. All right. So I just click on that one. Okay. All right, I clicked on it. Joining meeting now. Still not opening up. All right, here it is. Maybe it's coming now. All right, here it goes. Okay, it's sort of like loading up. Okay. there we go and you can continue without audio just skip through that and then there's that share button down at the bottom just make sure you share your entire screen share share screen how do I know which screen it'll okay so I'm going to show you I got three screens so I'm going to show you the first one which is the one I'm using it's the one from ring central new one okay so that's this one you can see everything is in there like message video phone text yeah the screen isn't shared yet try you have to click on that and then hit the blue share button okay all right so now you should see it yeah so this is like this is what my ring central looks like is this like a newer version of the older version i think this is a new version because the logo has the r in a square and i was told by ring central the r in a square logo is the new version so this has everything on it so if i want to transcribe a call or or make a call using a soft phone i use this um now i'll show you the one i'm using or or I just move it over. I don't even have to change it. So you should see another screen now. You see that one? Yeah, I can see this. If I click on a phone number in a PCR name record, this pops up. And this is the logo with a circle and a phone in it, not an R and a square. so I was told the circle logo is the old one and the square is the new one but when I click on text and PCR it doesn't go into that new screen it goes into this one okay I'm wondering if that's supposed to be that way or if I just don't have it set up right um are the texts syncing between the two meaning the other RingCentral. Yeah, and the other version, can you see the same text messages? So this is like the last one I received. So they're in there. Yeah, they're in both. So I'm like, why do I have both? I guess that's the question, especially since they're synced up. Can you search for RingCentral in the bottom left corner where it says type here to search? Like in your system tray? Down here? Even further down, like in your actual computer, it says like type here to search to the right. Okay, yeah. Type in RingCentral. I want to see if you have two versions. Okay, so it looks like you have multiple types of the RingCentral app open. so I imagine PCR is just kind of picking one and opening it um and what I would think would be happening is and this is kind of a guess shot in the dark um since you've used that text like the ring central phone one that's the same icon as the one that pops up when you do PCR um when you do the ring central phone one I imagine PCR has that just kind of stored locally to it so it knows to use that, so it prompts that to open. But it's also syncing to the other RingCentral app, so there's not really any kind of issue. It's just a weird type of display situation where it's prompting to another app, but they're syncing together, so it doesn't really impact anything. And I would... You could try... I don't know the specifics of how RingCentral works, to be completely candid with you. All I know is on my computer, the only thing I have is the RingCentral app. I don't have RingCentral phone, RingCentral meetings. I don't have those. And my texting and my calling works properly. So my assumption would be that you would be able to remove the RingCentral phone and RingCentral meetings apps from your computer, and it would then prompt to go to the RingCentral app. But again, it's not necessarily broken, so I wouldn't think there's anything we'd want to mess around with. See, that's the thing. I agree with you. I would like to just remove these legacy apps, but then my fear is they won't automatically open up the new app, and I'll have to call you again and then call RingCentral to somehow make sure that integration is taking place. The worst thing that would happen is we would need to set up the integration again. so if you want we can try and remove these from the computer and just make sure it's still working so you could try and uninstall the RingCentral phone app and then we'll just kind of see but my assumption is it's still going to work but we could do it on this call now if you want to it would be the so like this one this is the circular one this is the legacy one I want to go back ring central see I'm only seeing the square one I'm not seeing the round one the round one is the one I want to get rid of yeah do you see under apps it says ring central phone yeah click that and open file location like right click on it see this looks like it's legacy this one looks like it's legacy well I don't know maybe not I don't know about that one I would start with the RingCentral one and just try uninstalling that. I want to see what would happen. Because I know that mine will work with the new RingCentral app, no issue. So I think we can just uninstall this. The worst thing that happens is we just need to set up reintegration again. And that's no problem. So we could just uninstall this. I would probably say 95% sure there would be no issue. All right. That's a pretty good level of confidence. So, all right, I'm going to uninstall it. Let's see. Ready? Yep. so it should be searching for it and uninstalling it right now is that what's happening you think so yeah i think so um i'll just give it a second and see what it works its way through see i'm gonna have to figure this out because i have a new computer so i'm going to set everything up. I'm sort of in the process of doing all that, so this is one thing I'll have to make sure I set back up. Okay, so I think it's done. Yeah, try searching RingCentral again in the bottom and see if the RingCentral phone still appears. This one? That's the one we just removed. Try, go ahead and close the RingCentral phone one we have open in the back. Close that out. Yeah, close that. Maybe because it's open, it won't let us. Then let's try that again. I think this is the right one because this is where. Okay. All right. So should I test it and click on a name record to send a text? I don't think it uninstalled yet. Go back to that search bar and search RingCentral. I still saw it sitting there, so I just wanna make sure. Right click on the RingCentral phone app. This one, this one, right? Yeah, right click on that. Gosh, it's still in there. Do open file location. I lost your screen share. Yeah, you know what? When I opened that, I wonder... Here, when I stop, it says stop share. So you're still in there. Let's see, share. Yeah, I can see it now. It came back. It flickered for a second. But go ahead and share again. I can't see it now. All right, yeah. I tried to reshare. Now it's sharing. Okay. All right. That RingCentral phone app, try right-clicking on that in this list. This one at the bottom? Yep. See, that one looks like it's from 2020. Yeah. And then do delete. I'm wondering if this is just a shortcut, though. Yeah, hit delete. Yeah. Okay. Then go back to PCR and try prompting a text. All right. So the text screen won't allow me to text. Let's see. So I'm clicking on text. I did it again. um but it's not the number that i okay now it's the number that i click yeah okay uh i think just kind of where we are with this i think it's a non-issue yeah um but i it is interesting that it's using a different app but they're syncing so i i don't want to like poke the bear and make a problem yeah i don't have any issues either yeah because i'm concerned that those are like maybe they're offshoots from the main app and they're necessary. So maybe that's why it won't go away. Yeah. Okay. And all this was set up years ago. I don't know how it's set up. I don't know who set it up. I don't, and again, it's working. It's just, I have two apps, whereas I only need to use the one. Yeah. But I don't want to bother. I don't want to cause any issues. Yeah. If you do run into any issues, definitely give us a call. But at this point, I think it would just kind of be some type of legacy thing that's happening. But it's working properly. Yeah, it is working. Okay. So that's good. All right, Jason. Thanks for all your help. Yep. Absolutely. Bye. Have a good afternoon. Bye. Thank you.",
