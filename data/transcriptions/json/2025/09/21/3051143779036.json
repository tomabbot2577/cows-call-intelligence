Okay I went to the tab. Okay click on it. I did. Okay. So did you download Java and Launcher on this computer? I tried but nothing is I downloaded two different versions and nothing happened. Okay did you run the files once they downloaded yes I think so all right the windows search option at the bottom left yeah type in the word app and I think we should see system settings app yeah APP okay good okay go to assist settings system okay now it's on another screen okay slide that over on top of PCR okay click apps over at the left go to installed apps the first option okay let's see let's go back up at the very top okay so okay let's go down to the J's we shouldn't try Amazon credo as well okay you got two of them in here I don't know which one you need can you let's uninstall both of these so click over to the right with the three dots and then click on install we'll just redo this install I'm not sure which one you need but having to can definitely be an issue Okay, so you're going to uninstall both of those. And then we'll just run it when we can. Okay, now let's go down to the P's and look for PC Recruiter Launcher. Okay, so that's missing too. Okay, let's exit out of here. Okay. Okay, let's have you go to your Peace Recruiter login page, but don't actually log in. So just kind of bring up. Okay, I'll log out? Yeah. Joe, don't leave the meeting. Yeah, perfect. Okay. Just go to Peace Recruiter. Click on that. See where it says Launch or Install? There's Windows and Mac. Click on the one that says Windows at the very bottom left of your computer. Oh. Yeah, there you go. Click on that. So it sounds like we should have the – don't run it yet. Oh, shit. Stop? Yeah, stop. Okay, stop. Okay. So let's go to your downloads at the very top right of your browser. It's right next to where you see, like, work. We should see – so over at the left mark are the downloads. Okay. Okay, so that was the one. Why did it give you two of those? Oh, because I went twice. Yeah, but that's kind of weird that it gave you two different. Okay, I'm going to have you do this. Let's go to your Java download page. I'm going to get a fresh one just to make sure we're doing the right one. So go to a new tab. Go to java.com. Okay, download Java for desktop. Download Java for desktop. Okay, and then don't do anything just yet. Okay, that's the one that we do want. Okay, so let's open it. See where it says Java? up at the top. Oh, it went away. Yeah, so click on that, your downloads icon. Click on that most recent one. We're going to run this one first. So just click over on it on the left and hit open. Click yes. And then you'll want to, yeah. Then you're going to run through the steps to install that. It's over on the other screen. You have successfully installed, okay. Okay. Here's what it says. Okay. Go ahead and close that. Okay. Now we're going to go back to that downloads option at the top right. Okay. And this time pick PC Recruiter Launcher, which doesn't start PC Recruiter, but it is what opens up like the resume parsing screen. So click open? Yep, click open. It's what tells it to open up in Java. That's why you need both of these. Oh, welcome to PC Recruiter. Let me bring it over. Now what? Okay, hit next. I accept the terms in the next typical and then install finish okay so now I'm ready to go Not yet. What I'm going to have you do is go to your PCR login page. Okay. Now, the first time that we log in, we're going to see a couple extra prompts here. Go ahead and log in. And I'll walk you through them so you don't get them every time and get annoyed. Okay. Where it says, always allow, click on that checkbox. Open Control Loader. loader click allow basically you're saying when I go into PCR I need to be able to use that launcher which is what tells the rosemary parsing screen to open up okay the one other thing while we're here see at the very top right of PCR where you have your user image there's a gold number one letting you know about a station click on that click activate PCR browser notifications click says here and then over at the left you're going to see allow okay and then that so that's done okay now go ahead and try using your ad wizard There. It should be popping up. It won't come over. Yeah, it's probably on your other screen. It won't come over to the other screen. What the launcher is doing is opening it up in Java, which is why you need to have both of those. But you should be good now. Yeah. Oh, there it is. should be good now. Yeah. Oh, there it is. Jackburg. Perfect. Okay. All right. Thank you so much, Robin. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Have a good week. You too. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye.",
