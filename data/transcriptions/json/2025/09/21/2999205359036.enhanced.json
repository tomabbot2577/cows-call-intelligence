    "text": " Robin, how are you? Hi, Robin. It's Kenny Griffiths. How are you? I'm good. Yeah, I checked your account. Since like end of April, you've been billed for eight users. I think you dropped from 12 to 8, if I remember. Yeah, how much is it per user? Let me see. It was just in your account. Your action management. It was just in your account. Back there quickly. Yeah, your bill is $405.52 each month. and let's go a different way hold on one second Oh cheap rate 45 per user okay 45 what's 45 times 8 360 plus you have that PPI which is like that like kind of like inflationary it's like 0.43 percent yeah plus there's a Cuyahoga County tax. So is that, so what did you say 340 and then the balance is like the balance stuff? Yeah so it's the total comes to 405.52 and that's for eight users. Okay could you, Robin could you send me something because I I think all we get is like a total we don't get a like a breakdown. would you mind sending yeah I can send you one of your last invoices let me see let me go a different way to do this let me go in this way I'll send you the last paid invoice that should work that'll have like the full breakdown on it right yeah but like after you yeah after you do your first year there's like a slight like inflationary rate that they add it's like 0.43 percent or something like that um it does get added every year just after the first year oh wait I know why I gotta go to paid because you don't have any open invoices action management okay so if I go to this so they go to Dale that's who gets your invoices um here I'll do it this way I'm just going to download this one. And then I'll email it to you. Is it kgrippethatactionmgmt.com? Is that the best email for you? That is correct, ma'am. All righty. I downloaded one of the paid invoices. We'll have the breakdown. Download. Where did it go? Okay, that would be good. Just so I can tell him. Yeah, he should be getting, like, receipts and stuff emailed to him with the new system. Yeah, he does. He just sees the total and says, I thought we were paying $360, not $404, whatever it is. Yeah, it's that price increase and the tax because you're in Cuyahoga County. Yep, no worries. If I get a copy of that, that'd be great, and I'll give that to him tomorrow so he knows we're all on the up and up. Okay. All right. I am, okay, most recent invoice attached. I'll put in a subject line, and then the invoice is an attachment to this email that I'm sending you right this moment. Okie dokie. Thank you so much, Robin. I appreciate it. No problem. Have a great week. You too. Take care. Alrighty. Thanks. Bye. Bye-bye.",
