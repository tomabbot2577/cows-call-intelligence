    "text": " thank you for calling Jean Cantrell please hold while I try to connect you your call has been forwarded to the voicemail for Jean Cantrell no one is available to take your call at the tone please record your message when you finish recording you may hang up or press the pound key for more options hello Jean it's Jim Lombardo with PC recruiter I wanted to give you a quick call just to circle back with you I was following up to check on the your interest in the AI suite of PC Recruiter. That is, the trial has come to an end and I let it go a little longer than usual and my team is actually after me to see if you want to keep it or not, see if they should take it off. So give me a quick call, let me know if that is of interest to you. It would upgrade you to the Premium Plus package, it's just five bucks per user per month, but that would get that added to your accounts. So give me a quick call, let me know if that's of interest to you I can get everything set up to go or not but let me know which way I kind of what you're thinking my direct line is 440-856-0314 that's 440-856-0314 thanks Gina hope to talk to you soon bye bye",
