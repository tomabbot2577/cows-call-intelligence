    "text": " Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi, Teresa. Is Kathy in yet? Yes. Can I talk to her? This is Robin. Okay. Hold on just a minute, Robin. Thanks. Hello? Hey, Robin, how are you? Yeah, good, thanks. So I apparently overlooked an email that somebody wanted to go to two users and it was supposed to be out, you know what, let me tell you the customer name first. It's called GRC Executive LLC. Okay, hold on. GRC? Yes. Okay. Okay. okay so apparently the 7-11-25 invoice and the 8-11-25 invoice should have been for two users instead of four okay is it possible that i just go into those invoices no and go into all the invoices. Okay. All right. What's the best way to do this? Because he wants a refund on those. He wants a refund? It's a monthly subscription. Can't we just give him a credit on the 9-11 invoice? He wants it because it's really like two extra. So it's really talking about four users. Okay. Over the two months. Okay. Yeah. So I think deleting one of the payments, like refunding one of the payments would balance it out, right? let's see so he doesn't have the ppi okay so 489 so it's really um yeah if it was he should have had two users um one month and two users the other month um so it's 356 yeah um that's like we refund one payment we can either or we can have he has no payment in in september so i mean You have to pay for a refund. Okay. Well, today is actually the 11th, so I'd billed today. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I'll... Because I know you have a problem doing partials. Yeah, I know you have a problem doing partials. No, this one's probably not a partial. Yeah, because if we refund the one from today, it's a full amount. But I'll create a refund receipt. I'm going to go ahead and change this recurring right now for him. I don't know why we have people's names in our payment methods, like Ryan Allen and Kent Burns I don't know why we have people's names in the I noticed when you start putting names in it wants to use a person name it says a company name you know to come no I'm talking about with the payment method you know like credit card or that it said has people's names in there I don't know why so let me see I'm going to, let's see, so I'm going to go ahead and put dates in here. Um, it's hard to do this with one hand. Um, 89 was the rate, right? Yeah, apparently there was an adjustment that I did that was supposed to be for three. I don't know if that got written over with the whole tax thing, but then you say it's two. But then I looked through my history and I'm like, he did email. So I did the one adjustment for three. Changed to two users in July. And, oh, he's out of the country. He's in Puerto Rico. Okay. So that makes more sense. Okay. So I'm going to create this. Okay. And then I'm going to do that in Biller Genie. Shouldn't be a problem. Let's see. So it does tap in today. So I can actually, I think I can void today's payment. Okay. Because it doesn't say refund. It says void. So are you sure you want to void? It will also void my payment in QuickBooks. Okay. so i think i have to detach it from the invoice yeah okay so i voided the payment today so i created the change in quickbooks and i voided today's payment. So he won't have any payment today. So basically the July payment he made covered July and August. Okay. And then I have September already down to two users. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I think that one's good. Is that the only one? I believe so. look it out alrighty have a good day you too bye ok bye",
