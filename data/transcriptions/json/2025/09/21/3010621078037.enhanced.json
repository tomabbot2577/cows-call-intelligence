    "text": " Thank you for calling Maid Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Heidi Martin from Bain Consulting and Search. And I was just curious. I've noticed with PCR that I'm getting logged out like about every five to ten minutes. And I don't know if there's a way to change that so that it's at least 30 minutes, if that's possible. Okay. Let me check on your inactivity timeout. Are you in the BCSI or BCSI transfer database? Transfer, I believe. Oh, transfer. Okay. Let's see here. So this database is set for 180 minutes. So it's not a database setting. It's something specific on your computer. Are you using a VPN, do you know, to connect to the Internet? I don't think so. Not here at the – when I'm at my home office, then yes, but not here as far as I know. Okay. Yeah, so VPNs usually is what cause the logout. They change your IP address at random intervals, and whenever that changes, it'll take you out of your session. So if it's not VPN, do you have a lot of tabs open, like more than 10 tabs open on your browser? Right now I have four, and two of them are for PCR because one is the main PCR one, and then the other one is when I'm using the capture, it opens up a new window. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, as long as it's not doing more than 10, 12 tabs. That's the other reason we see people getting logged out, where Google says, you know, you have too many tabs open. We're going to make some of these inactive to save on memory. And if it chooses PCR to make inactive, it'll log you out. So, okay, it's not that. Yeah, my boss also has noticed that this has been happening to her as well. So I don't know if something has changed on our network or what, but I will let her know that it's probably our own network is the issue. Yeah, it might be the VPN. Let me check one other thing here. Is your username, is it H. Martin? Yes. Okay. I'm going to take your IP address that you've logged into most recently and put it as a whitelisted IP address. sometimes that helps. Let's see. Security. Okay, so your IP address has been whitelisted. See if that helps. If not, just double-check to make sure you aren't using a VPN and that you don't have too many browser tabs open. If that doesn't help, in the next hour or so, You keep seeing things. Keep logging you out. Give us a call back. We can continue to troubleshoot. Okay, I appreciate it. Yeah, it's just been within the last, I think, two weeks where it's like I was on it, and I'm even in PCR putting in the information for the capture, and I go back to my main one, and it just logged me out. I'm like, okay, okay, that's weird, but it's okay. So, I mean, I can log back in quickly, but it's just one of those, I just was curious what was going on. So thank you, and I appreciate your time, Garrett. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, just let us know if that continues to be a problem. Okay, I appreciate it, and you have a wonderful day. You too. Bye. All right.",
