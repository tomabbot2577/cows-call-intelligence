    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey there, Robin. It's Butch with Omega Point Partners. How are you? I'm good. Oh, I'm just reading an email from you that transcribed really bad. Oh, did it really? Okay. Oh my gosh, I'm laughing at this. It sends me an email when somebody leaves a message in accounting. Okay. Okay. Hi, this is, excuse me, this is Sweet Arm with the Make a Point Partners. Okay, that's right. Sweet Arm, huh? Yeah. Hi, Sweet Arm. Yeah. Well, anyway, hey, the reason I was calling is I was going to my statements, and on August 8th, I got charged three times the normal amount. Oh, I think I know why, based on that date. Okay, so you were probably, I'm going to look it up, but I'm going to tell you what I think it is. You are probably set up on like a sales receipt where we kind of send you a receipt and then try to process a card. And when we switch billing systems, you would have to be set up in our new system. So our bookkeeper probably went in the old system reprocess since that wasn't done. Let me see what we got. It's Omega Point Partners, right? Oh, wait a minute. I know why. I'm in the wrong area. I think sales. customers hold on that's probably exactly why but I got checked two systems to confirm yeah cuz it's normally like about 250 a month and when I saw that I went okay well that's interesting I better call find out why is this not coming up would we have you in here another way maybe just by name? S-W-E-E-D-A-R. Okay, this is in Butler County. Okay, that's why. Okay, so let me look it up the way we actually have it for billing. Yeah, that's exactly what happened. So let me see if you're R-7. Yeah, you don't have the details in stored in our new system. Do you want me to set that up with you? If it corrects it and credits me back, awesome. Well, no, those payments were correct because they were, you made a payment on August 22nd for, or it was processed for the August 17th invoice. And then August 8th, let's see. So let's see. So the April was paid in May. Then you had, April was paid in May. May and June and July, there was one payment covering all of them in August. And then your August 17th invoice was processed August 22nd. So the process of the three invoices on August 8th is correct, but that was for your May, June, July. okay can see I show a May payment of 275 43 on May 15th this is the charge of the car right but that was for April but that was for April okay okay that was for April yeah so the issue is we're having to go back in the old system and reprocess them because they haven't set it up in the new system yet okay that's supposed to do something I didn't do it yeah so your next invoice is scheduled for September 17th. If you want to give me the card details now, I could set you up for auto pay, and then that way, on September 17th, it processes automatically, just as you were previously in the old system, but it'd be set up correctly. Okay, because I also show another one charged on August 22nd. Right, that was for your August 17th invoice. Right, right. So I really shouldn't send it this way, but I will. because it's just easier to read than a statement. Okay. So let me see. Okay, so what is it I need to do? So let me, okay, so I've got, let me make sure it's here, though. Customer info. Okay. So if you want to give me a card that we store, I could set you up for auto pay in the new system. So everything is current now, but we just had to kind of do it manually in the old system. Everything is current now. It's just you had to make multiple payments because there was multiple invoices open. Okay. Do you want to give me a new card? Well, is the old card not good anymore? It's only in the old system. Oh, okay. You can't, like, transfer it over to the new because they're encrypted for security. So you just need a card number. Yeah. So what would the name on the card be? It's going to be Butch Sweetar. And that's S-W-E-E-D-A-R. That's correct. Okay. And the card number? Three, seven, one, five. Okay. 557-831-64001. Okay. I'm guessing by the format that's an American Express, right? Okay. Yes, ma'am. Expiration? 129. 129. And then the security number. So American Express, it'll be the four-digit number on the front. 9927. 9927? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Is the address associated with the card 8080 Beckett Street, I'm sorry, Beckett Center Drive, Suite 303, West Chester, Ohio, 45069? No. It's not even close. Okay. What is the correct address? It's 1-8827 Bienville. What is it? 1-8827 Bienville, B-I-E-N. V-I-L-L-E Court. Okay. Is that still Westchester? No, it's, I'm in Louisiana. Oh, okay. Okay. So it's Prairieville, I'll spell that. P-R-A-I-R-I-E. He is a victor. I-L-L-E. Okay. Louisiana. Okay. 707-69. 707-69. Okay, add card. I'm actually going to change that then. Okay, add that in. okay so I will turn this on auto pay on due date and a card ending in four zero zero one okay so going forward that's going to process correctly now what I'm also going to do though I need to change this address oh shoot wait a second let me see that is it What did I put in here? Yes, I can. Okay. I'm going to change this other invoice, like the address information. Sorry I didn't catch it earlier, but I was just going through, and I thought, well, that's weird. And I just saw that, because like I said, normally I see 250, you know, somewhere around there a month. And when I saw that, I thought it might be a good call. So I'm glad I did. Yeah. Okay, I'm changing all this address information. I'm going to put Omega Point Partners, too. Up here. Omega Point Partners. You handle accounting, too, huh? Now I am, yeah. Doing a little bit of both. Okay, let's see. I've got all that fixed for you. Why is she in here? Oh, why is she in here? who's she our bookkeeping consultant she's probably thinking i'm doing something or something's changing maybe she's getting out okay let me save that time okay so i'm going to take this address and change it in your invoice we're going forward so it has the nice clean address that we should have for you And I'm also going to change. Okay, this should be now. So now this becomes out-of-state taxes too. All right, let me make sure I got it all correct. Well, one good thing, too, by giving me the new address, you no longer have the Ohio taxes applied. That's awesome. So that brings it down for you. Okay. Okay. All right. So that is now all updated. Cool. So everything's squared away. There's nothing else we need to do? Nope. If it doesn't go through, I'll reach out. But now we have AutoPay turned on with the card ending in 4001 in the new system. Updated the address for you. which then also takes off the Ohio tax stuff. All righty. It comes out of state. And I think we're all set. If something doesn't process correctly, I'll let you know. But the next one is September 17th. Thanks, Robin. Appreciate it. No problem. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. All righty. Thanks. Bye.",
