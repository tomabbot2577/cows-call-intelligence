    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. I'm looking for Robin. This is? Robin, this is Ernie Bivona. Hi, how are you? How are you? I'm well. You sent us instructions for Chris to get into his MacBook with PCR, and he can't do it. well can he not get to the login page yeah so i'll go over here hi so my name is chris i um so basically i downloaded everything that we had to download and if i type in the wrong password it'll come up and say like you know password incorrect but uh when i when i type in the correct password the correct login i hit submit and it just nothing opens uh let me see Should go. What database are you logging into? I see you have three. Consumer, industrial. Okay, industrial. Okay. We don't use consumer. I'm not sure why it's still there, but we haven't used it in about 20 or 30 years. Let me see if it's tracking anything. You should have it for tomorrow. Yeah. I'm going to have it in my – And what is the – what is the username you're trying to log in as? C-F-P. F as in Frank. C as in Chris. F as in Francis. P as in play. Okay. I do show you logged in earlier today. 7-7-1-25. Wait, no. Yeah, today's the 7th. And you've logged in. So I have access to it on my iPad, and then I have access to it on the Office ThinkPad, like laptop, but I need access on it on my MacBook. I have a MacBook Air. It's new. I got it within the last year or two. Okay, and you're using the same URL and getting to the same login page, right? Yes. Okay. Can you do a screen share from their computer? Yeah. Okay. I'm trying to just see here. Okay. What browser are you using? So I've tried it with Google Chrome and I've tried it with Safari and both to get the same result. Okay Just want to make sure they're okay. So See if PL just go this way see if I can find your username And what is your email address? For the PC Recruiter? Just in general. Yeah, PC Recruiter doesn't use an email address for signing in or anything. It's just a username. Okay, cool. So then the email address would be Christopher, C-H-R-I-S-T-O-P-H-E-R. and then that's going to be at starboardconsultants.net. Okay, so I just sent you a link to join a screen share. now did you do the like um the amazon coretto and launcher installs on this computer yes i did but i um i can do it again so wait this is robin main sequence is that you yeah yep that's me All right. All right. emitting you. Okay so I'm going to turn off microphone and you could do the same otherwise it echoes. Yeah and you could also turn off camera if you want but what I am going to have you do is at the very bottom where you click share screen it's the rectangle with the arrow and then once you click that go over to entire screen. Allow share window, allow share screen. Is that, um, share entire screen? Okay. Okay. All right. So, I'm going to have you do, oh, it's a little blurry for some reason. Doesn't usually look like that. Okay. Um, let's have you go over to your Chrome browser. keep this window open that's okay just go over to a new tab because we're not going to stay in that tab anyway sorry we want to go to chrome yes let me get out of that tab just so it's yeah you don't have to look at but just don't close that meeting window yeah all right so i'm waiting for so i've been actually having a little problem with um google chrome except it's bouncing around right now okay I can't hear you. I don't know if she can hear you. I can hear him. Yeah. I wonder if it's something with your Chrome profile. Do you like force quit on Chrome? That might kick you out of our meeting for a moment, though. Well, I'm on Safari. Okay. Yeah, that's kind of weird how it's... just bounce around. Let me see. Show in finder. I'm going to replace it. It's just like a broken file, you know? There we go. Okay, so I guess we'll just do add and then sign in to just, let's do continue without accounts for now. Chrome couldn't update this. Oh, it's all, it's your person one, sorry. Okay, now we're on Chrome. Okay, see where it says the relaunch to update try that I just want to see go down to help go to about Google Chrome I'm just gonna have it like check for updates and everything okay hit relaunch That's something different. Okay, the URL that you get to go to your database, can you paste that at the top of this window or in a new tab? Yes. Okay, so let me go to... Oh, that's just PCR capture. That only pops up when you're on somebody's LinkedIn page. That doesn't take you to PC Recruiter. Oh, that's cool. Yeah that's just an extension like if you're on LinkedIn to bring them over to your database. Okay so this is the link let's see it what happens if we open this link in Chrome. Is that the link the PCR this one? Yes yes that takes you to your login page. Okay, so here we are. Okay. Hold on one second. I forgot the second. My password is... Okay. Password is... the username is not case sensitive but the password is. Yeah so I could log in. Okay so here you're going to say always allow then open URL and then hit allow here and then hit allow one more time and then next time you go in from this computer you won't have to get all of those options. And then this is just a little announcement you could say don't show it again and skip. Wait so we're in? Yeah so you're in. So what the heck was the issue? Was it just that I had to update my Chrome? Possibly. So what you're going to want to do is bookmark this link that you just signed into if you haven't done that yet. yet. So if you hit that little star over at the right of the URL. That little star right here. Yep that'll bookmark. Okay. And then hit done. And then what I personally like to do, if you go to those three vertical dots at the top right of your browser, um then click on, oh where is it, okay uh go to bookmarks and lists. There you go. And then say show bookmarks bar. So that way you'll see it as a little shortcut. Right here. Boom. Yeah. Now I wonder if this works on Safari. Should we try? Does it work the same way Robin on Safari? Well it's better to use Chrome because you would if you're going to use PCR capture because you can't put the PCR capture in Safari. Okay, that makes sense. That's why I was wondering why I couldn't. Okay. I mean, two different things. I mean, it's just like that extension, which is like if you're on LinkedIn or something that you see, that will only pop up if you have it connected to your database, but you're in through Chrome when you're on somebody's LinkedIn page. Okay, that makes sense. All right, that's perfect. Now I have it. That makes my life so much easier. I start school tomorrow, too, which is great. yeah I think you're in I think you're good and it looks like you had the the Amazon credo and launcher done so I think you're good there as well perfect all right thank you so much you're the best you are welcome have a great week thank you Robin you're welcome bye",
