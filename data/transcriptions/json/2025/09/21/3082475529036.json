    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Josh Bocek. I work with STSI, Staffing Technical Services, and I'm calling to see if I can get an updated API. Oh, you mean like an API key and app ID? That is correct, yes. Okay. So, we kind of did away with those, and if any integrations are requesting those, we would just put in, it's kind of like dummy text, honestly, where you would just type in API key, all one word, lowercase, for the API key, and then app ID, all one word, lowercase, for the app ID. Is there a way, could I give you my email address? I don't want to make a mistake of jotting that down wrong. So is there a way I could give you my email address and you could maybe send that to me via email? Perfect. Yeah, I'm ready when you are. All right. So it is J for Josh. B as in boy O-C-E-K at stsigroup.com Okay. Group.com. I guess what I need is that would suffice providing the new API credentials. That would be that. Right. You still, with some integrations, need to supply something called a database ID. And I can pull that up for you as well and put that in the email. I could just look up what the STSI database ID is. Oh, it looks like you are self-hosted. So I can give you the instructions to find the database ID in your database. That'll at least put you in the right direction there. But, yeah, I'll include app ID, API key, database ID. I think those are what's mostly used for any API integrations. Perfect. And then I apologize I rudely interrupted you when you were repeating my email address. Do you feel you have it? Yeah, no, no problem. I have it. It's your first initial, your last name at stsigroup.com. That is correct. Yes, sir. Awesome. All right. Yeah, I'll send that your way. And if any other questions come up, just let us know. But that should get you connected up to any API integration. Love it. I greatly appreciate it, Garrett, and I hope you have an amazing rest of your day. Thanks so much. You as well. Thanks. Bye now.",
