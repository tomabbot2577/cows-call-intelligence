    "text": " Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi, is Kathy available? Yes. Hold on just a minute, Robin. Thanks. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hey, how are you? Hey, good. Did you not get my email? I did. I'm just this one. Yeah. Yeah. And I just replied back. I was sitting on hold the whole time. It was music playing and everything. Yeah. You were on hold? I was on hold. Yeah. So then I called back in after I saw your email. I'm like, oh, I guess she doesn't know I'm on hold. Oh, she thought she had put it on hold, and then she thought it hung up. She was like, oops, it's not there. I don't know what happened. I was on hold the entire time. Oh, so sorry. I need you to fix something for me. This is kind of like really bad. So it looks like, only because of the amount. It's not really that bad. Four Seasons Talent Partners. Okay, hold on just a second. So I have to, I can only use one hand because on this phone, it does not connect with my Bluetooth. So I have to hold my cell phone up to my head. So hold on just a second. So I have one hand instead of two to type. So let me get to that customer. And it's Four Seasons, you say? Yeah, that should be enough to pull it up. Four Seasons Talent Partners, right? Right. So this is one that I didn't set up, so I did look it up and confirmed. The invoices on 12-19 and 12-19, those both had one month of user, but then their installation fee split over the first two invoices. So those were fine. And then 2-19 is when they started their regular monthlies. then 319 was regular monthly so i think what happened is when it was created from a sales receipt over to an invoice they used the original amount that was their install and not the 50 dollars that should only be i haven't changed anything yet so it needs to change obviously is we got to do something with these invoices. Anything from 219 on should be $50 only. Yeah. I can adjust the recurring right now if you want, but then we got to refund all that difference back. And I just don't know. I don't want to mess it up. So it's installation payments. Those were just the first. Yeah, that was just the first two invoices. And then after that, it was set up correctly as 50. But I'm guessing they went to kind of like a sales receipt in March. And then with a new billing system, the invoice was created, but with a 425 fee instead of 50. Yep. So I'll create a credit, and then we will refund that back to them. So I fixed the June to make it only 50. Okay. And so we have to refund April and May because they haven't paid June yet. So we've got $375 to pay for two months. We've got $750 to refund. Yeah. Okay. I'll fix that right now. Okay. Should I go to the recurring right now and fix it? Because it's coming out. Okay, I'm just going to take off the install line. Take off that top line, yep. Perfect, okay. Yep. I didn't want to touch it until you saw it, because it looked like it was the sales receipt to new invoice switch that kind of went and got messed up. So let me create the credit memo here. I'm going to put you on speaker so I can cut the phone down. Okay. So I'm going to... I think I'm just going to send this. Okay. So I'm going to... I'm going to send this. I'M GOING TO SEND THIS. WHY DOES IT SAY TOTAL CREDIT 25. Oh, because the original invoice was $50. So, okay. Let me fix the other one as well. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's see. So that would be that one. Okay. The March was... That one. Okay. Yeah, the April needs to be $50. Yep. I'm fixing that one now. Okay. I was reading 325 credits. Should it be 375 for each? Yes, it is. Oh, yeah, I see. Okay. Oh, because they got the one open death right there. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. so so they they're owed $700 because it should have only been $50 and so they're owed wait how come this one says $2 of $3.75 this one is this one is weird why is it $3.75 it says amount received so this says that on 7-16 they got a $50 payment so this actually did she just make that it says 7-16 right now she didn't have that before so I'm going to apply that to the 619 invoice I didn't know she could actually it's got a memo created by QuickBooks Online to link credits to charges Yeah, I don't know if that's correct. Let me, because the bill for 619 was not 50 before. I just changed it to be 50 just now. Well, her open balance is 700. So that would be... That's because it applied 50 of my credit to that change. So I'm fixing that, but I have to double check to see if she actually indeed paid 50, or if QuickBooks Online is just entering something wrong, because they were paying through Biller Genie, So it isn't something that QuickBooks should have necessarily adjusted. So I think it might have been something wrong. So let me look real quick. And of course, Biller Genie is doing something weird with their login. Yeah, it's marking the June one as paid now. I know. I'm just holding just a second. I'm just I have to I got to log into something else to check and see if they actually sent a payment. The last payment I see here says 425 from 519. So I think that is a mistake. And I'm just going to delete that. I will check Intuit as well. But I think it applied that for some reason when I created the credit memo, and I don't know why. So I'll double-check the Intuit merchant just to be safe. Basically, we need to be refunding. $375, $750 back. Yeah. She shouldn't be able to pay the $50 by credit card in QuickBooks. So I think that was an internal error. We saw that message that said QuickBooks did it, and I think QuickBooks just did it wrong. I think QuickBooks took your $750 credit, or one of your $375s, and took $50 of it and applied it to that June 1. Yep, it did. And that's why I deleted that because I was like, so it made it only a 325 refund instead of a 375. But I don't know what it was basing that on at all. Maybe because it thought, oh, well, you have an outstanding invoice, so we're going to apply the credit first to the outstanding invoice and then to the other. It could have been that. But it didn't ask me. It just did it. And I obviously didn't want it to do that. I guess, well, I guess that's a question, though. They do have a $50 balance for this month. And if that... Well, they're going to have June. Well, June's now showing as paid. And then they're going to get July soon. Yeah, refresh. So, yeah, refresh the page. So June shouldn't show paid. And then July will come on Saturday. Correct. So you want me to create the July invoice now, apply 50 to it, apply 50 to the June, and then give them the balance of 650 instead of 750? And then they owe us $100 back in two days? Hold on one second. I'm trying to think here because what is she saying? Did she do two payments in May? Payment payment. So I have no payments processing today. So that, so there aren't any, that's not funded by QuickBooks. And it's not going, it hasn't gone through Bill or Jeannie. So they do owe us 50 for the June invoice. and I could create July's now. Now she's showing this thing that she sent. Here, I'm going to forward this to you. Because according to her file, now I can't remember if it was open. I think it was. According to her thing, she paid this on 5-19 by credit card. Payment. Now there's 5-14. Yep, that was her bill of G-Me. And 5-19. Okay. Mm-hmm. But that was really for... Okay, so we got invoice payment, invoice payment. Those are all right. Invoice payment, sales receipt, the process. That's correct. Now we're into April. invoice dated 4-15 was not paid until 5-14 in the new system but that one was overpaid right so that 4-15 invoice needs to be 50 dollars yes i fixed it i created a i created a credit memo on today, 7-16, for 3-75 for the April and 3-75 for the May. Okay. Now do the invoices themselves. No. No. No. Okay. No. No. Because they've already been paid. I created the credit memo of the installation costs. Okay. And they have a credit memo on their account. The thing is, is they do owe us for the June 19th the correct $50. Okay. And I could create the July invoice now to take care of that and then apply $50 to it. And then they would have $650 they would be getting back. $600 they would be getting back. And then, wait, wait. So $750. No, $650. $650. Yeah, it'd be $650. They would be getting $650 back. And then they would be whole through July. They wouldn't owe again until August 19th. Okay. And that lines up with her numbers. Okay. Okay, let's do that. Okay. Okay. Let me go here. Let's see. I think the... This does not say... It should say do upon receipt. Let me change that. Save the template. And then I'm going to... And then I'm going to come here and do a payment. And... We're going to do this. And we're going to apply our credit. So now, yeah, so now it shows, if you refresh, it shows that it's, the open balance is negative $650. Okay. Okay. And then I'll create that payment to go back to them. I can do that. And it will be easier and simple, clear. Okay, so anything else while I'm doing that? That will, I'm getting that fixed and I'll get this refund issued for Seasons Talent. Okay, let's see. So we're going to refund. We're going to refund $650. And I'll go ahead and send the email to Cheryl so she sees that's coming back. Exceeds original transaction amount. So I'm going to have to split it. Okay. Let's see. They use the same credit card in QuickBooks and in Biller Genie. So, I am going to – I'll see if I can refund this through QuickBooks. Okay, I'll work on it. I'll get it paid out. I might have to do it in two payments in Biller Genie, or I'll do it in QuickBooks, but I'll get a way to do it. Anything else? Are you there, Robin? Robin? Are you there? Hello? Robin? Robin? Robin can you hear me yeah I can't hear you anymore Robin I'm sorry I'm going to call you back okay can you hear me now yeah my headset it sucks i need to get a new one i have a wire on it can you hear me now yeah okay it's a wired thing and so every once in a while i hit it like just the right spot that kind of cuts out so i need to get a wireless one okay so you're going to work on that are you going to follow up with her directly or should i uh it depends on what you'd like to do like i sent her I sent her a note about the refund but my payment didn't go through because it's higher than the one invoice that they show so I might have to do it in two payments That's okay as long as she gets her money I don't think she'll care As long as she gets it I just have to I just want to figure out the best way to get it back to her, but I'll get it figured out. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much. You're welcome. All right. Bye.",
