    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. you. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, this is John. How are you? I'm well, John. How are you? I'm doing well. All right. Yeah. So I want to show you around a demo of PC Recruiter a little bit. And I think you said you used it in the past. So you're somewhat familiar with it. so just kind of wanted to see did you have any specific questions or areas of interest or yeah yeah I think there's a couple things um that I was curious about to see if things have changed it's been two to three years since I've last used it um but when I was using it prior to that I had been using it for about five years straight so definitely familiar with what I know but if there are any changes, there was a couple of things I'd be curious to learn. One being when it comes to like linking email addresses, things of that nature, and just sending out like marketing emails, does it cost extra to like link my Microsoft Outlook email with PCR so that it goes through that email address? Or I guess how do I go about doing that? Okay, certainly, certainly. Yeah, That would be, I don't know, did you use our email campaigns and or sequencing back then? Sequencing, I don't know. Yeah, we used the email campaign. Emails were around. They were a little newer than that. Perfect, perfect. So, yeah, let me share my screen. I'll kind of roll through here as I answer your question. So there is no cost to hook PC Recruiter up with your Outlook. Okay, so when you're utilizing the system here, and let me get into my database here. Do you see my screen okay? Yep, looks good. All right. All right. So if you're looking at the screen, when you email out a PC recruiter, be it individual, in bulk, even as part of a sequence, when you go and you send your email, you would have to set up an alias. Yeah. So you would need to set up wherever your email is coming from. In this case, I have a Gmail account showing up in there, or I might even have an alias, maybe a different one that's Outlook. So you could hook that up. Sure. That's something that you need to do, no extra cost to do it. Part of the setup is we would help you to set that up. So, yes, you can hook that up. There is an Outlook integration if you're on a PC. There's an Outlook integration that some people use. It used to be a separately billed product, but now it's rolled into all of our packages called the portal. Oh, okay. So that is the piece that you can open up, and you can actually open PC Recruiter inside of Outlook. So it gives you a little extra, syncs your calendar automatically. But the biggest thing people want to do with email is simply be able to email out of PC Recruiter from their Outlook address and then have those emails that come back in be tagged into the database. So if I looked at, for example, your record in my database, I use PC Recruiter, and I can see any emails I've sent right there and any emails you might have sent back are going to come as email received. So they're automatically right there. Okay. So that'll work with Outlook or any other mail-compatible program. Now, if you're emailing out a PC, you could be sending an email campaign. You can also opt to utilize another, like a send grid or something like that. If you wanted to be able to email it, it'll still come from you. It just doesn't come from your actual Outlook address, but it'll return to your Outlook address and it'll appear to come from you. So in that case, when you send your email campaign, you just pick your other, your send grid alias or whatever other alias you wanted. Maybe you want to email it from an inbox ad or something like that. So you could do that too. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, because that was actually part of my next question when it comes to setting up like a roll up or something of that nature. What does it look like to, I guess the big things I would want to be sure to, I guess, just see and understand to make sure things make sense on my end is to, one, what does it look like to import contacts from like an Excel spreadsheet? and then from there creating a group or a roll-up of those contacts and then last you know previewing a bulk email or something of that nature for sure for sure so so yeah so as you know we have a generic file importer so anywhere you might have a file you can go to the quick add up here and you can pull in a list of companies whatever so we'll do names for now i would simply go to import list now the nice thing about this is the very first thing it does is it requires you to put it on a roll-up list so your roll-up list is either already there or you can create one down at the bottom you can add roll up and I could date it today's date let's say so okay if I create a new role since I could do that or maybe I want to add them to my bulk test I can just go ahead and select that list so be it that I add them to an existing or create my own either way that's going to work from for the import here so I would go to my generic file import and then I'm able to select my spreadsheet. It just needs to be a standard garden variety CSV. I'm going to go down through here and I keep a couple of ones here. There's a database so I can pull that. So as you open up that CSV you're pulling it in. It's just it's helpful if you have the the first column be the headers of what's in the column because it helps in the mapping because as you go through the mapping it kind of pulls in at the bottom there's the spreadsheet data and you'll see since I have names up here email first name last name LinkedIn that makes it easier to select email is going to be my email field so I can kind of go through and pick everything thought it okay so I can go through and I would map it in and kind of pick each each field I'll just pull it to because you get I don't have to go through pull each one so you can pull all your different fields no no map everything where it doesn't be and then you go next then you have the option to say do you want it to check for duplicates or not you can say that skip so if a dupe is found it just doesn't import it or you can even what a lot of people like is to do the update of duplicate found so you can say that if a dupe is found update the information found in the spreadsheet and add it to the record that's existing and I might do a specific maybe it's going to be their email address or maybe I want it to be their first name last name company name or last name and work phone or letter of an email address whatever and then when you hit import it's going to pull everything in import that entire spreadsheet and it will be automatically on that roll-up list so the roll-up list you picked is then going to contain all of the records that you pulled in okay got it and then from your roll-up list you can obviously control what fields are going to show on here you would then be able to select all results and you could go up here to the email it's a little envelope icon I think it's called letter in the system there and then I could just select one of my campaigns so I can create a new campaign maybe I want to use an existing one maybe I want to update your contact info and it'll give it like a category it'll give the subject you can edit that here you can pick which email you want it to come from you can it's going to go to that selected set of people and with email campaigns you also can by default it goes now but you might also say send it later maybe even a certain date a a certain time so you can kind of set it up that way got it and then you could even another perfect you can do in the setup you can say only sent out 50 emails a day so you can kind of squeak it out I like to do that when I send it to like 2,000 people because I don't get overwhelmed with everybody replying on the first day do 50 or 100 a day sure wait it stays under the radar you were able to better respond to the individuals and track everything that's going on okay perfect and then and then of course analytics that's going to show you the ability to report on your campaigns so you can look and see of all the campaigns you sent you can look at open rates and click rates and replies bounces I can even see who clicked what when and how many times perfect okay and then we've added now a little bit more recently the sequencing piece it's included in the premium package what that does is that kind of takes into account what happens to the initial email so you're able to set up a sequence the very first step is usually an email and then in the sequence you can say that if they open the email add them a second send them a second email or maybe you want them to go on a call list if they open the email or maybe you want to have one email wait three days send a second wait five days send a third you can actually build various different processes with main steps and then you have various different if it's connected do this if it's left message do this if it's no answer do that so I can kind of pick and choose a whole redirected sequence in here and sure it can be straight up emails only or it can also include adding them to a call list if you have ring central it can even send out text using the ring central piece and then okay the cool thing if If you add them to a call list, you're going to have a list of all your calls right there. And you can go right into the first one. With RingCentral, you can even click the little button there to dial their phone number. Maybe you put in a script. And then you go left message, brings up to the next person. You get a synopsis of their record, their activities, and everything like that. So it's a couple of ways. I do have, yeah, I was just going to say, it's definitely improved since. I do have RingCentral. Now, is there like a special adapter or link or some type of program that I have to purchase for those to be linked? Or is that part of it as well? It's included. So if you have RingCentral, part of the setup would be our team would hook RingCentral into your database so that when you go to any record, you'd be able to click the phone number button. So you can click the phone and dial the number. You can click the text icon and send a text. it's also going to record all the activities for incoming and outgoing calls like I have in here I use RingCentral so I can see I don't know if I have any here but it'll show incoming outgoing calls automatically recorded in the activities there right there outbound call perfect so these are automatically there so no additional cost if you have it we can just hook it right in perfect and then I guess the only last question frankly I'm probably a pretty easy sell just because I have used it and I like it quite a bit. It's just something where the last couple of years, it just didn't make sense when it came to using it, but it's definitely something I've wanted to get back to. The only really question else that I have, I understand this is all within the premium package. Is there other packages that exist? I'm just kind of curious what levels there are to it. Well, a couple of different options. So we do have an enterprise package, which is a little bit cheaper and it includes less software. So the enterprise leaves off the email campaigns. It leaves off the sequencing, and it leaves off that analytics reporting dashboard. So very simple package, but it doesn't have all of the advanced email campaign tools and everything. So that one is a little bit cheaper. I think it's $95 instead of the $115 per user per month, and $500 set it up instead of the $750, but it includes quite a bit less software. So that is another package. And then we have another package that it's a little – so we actually have another product called PCRM, which I have been including with the premium package for a little while now because it simply gives you another logon to PC Recruiter. It's a different user interface. It still has pretty much all the same functionality as the PC Recruiter. The searching isn't quite as good, but they're working on updating that. It does include a little bit of AI, so you can, like, generate a candidate summary, or it'll help generate an email. So you could do that. So sometimes I've been including that, that PCRM package, and that I usually just add five bucks per month. So it makes it 120 instead of 115 per user per month. To give you an idea of what it looks like, here's a screen, actually a database, a full on database. so you remember when I logged in I was looking at Terry Stidham or if I went over here and picked someone else maybe I go to Courtney Friedman I'm looking at her record if I log into my PCRM same database I'm gonna be able to go in here and I can go to names and I'm gonna see Courtney Friedman's gonna be the top one the most recent one I looked at right there so I can look at her record in PCRM. So again, a CRM product, but it has just about everything PC Recruiter has. It was originally designed, it's a long story, it was originally designed to be a renewed interface for PC Recruiter, but then they added so much CRM functionality, they've kind of spun it as a separate product, but it shares the same database. So five bucks more, same setup, it'll give you this if you needed it. This includes a little more AI functionality, but all the other same stuff, like you can look at your pipeline, roll-ups, all the same stuff, just a little bit different of a of a formatting. Got it. Yeah, I don't think I would need that, but I was curious just as to what things look like. I do think the premium sounds like a pretty good deal, just for an extra 20 bucks, getting that extra automation sounds worthwhile. And with that new piece, you'd be kind of hitting the ground new, retraining on everything, whereas you, since you've used PC Reader, you already know exactly how to use it, so that's going to give you a leg up there. training is also included so we'd help train you get ring central signed up hook your email in hook your outlook in all that's included too got it that's really helpful to know actually um okay perfect so then I'm curious what do next steps then look like I know it's pretty quick overview I guess probably just because I'm familiar with it but what do next steps look like in order for me to get things up and running well what I would do is I could email you the paperwork to review it comes in a panda doc which is just a different name brand like a DocuSign it will review that just one year agreement of one you one user you're right it's just you yep correct okay yeah so I could email that over to you and I would just need to make sure I have your company name and address correct and if I think I don't I just have the name sure yeah you want me to eat yeah you know that's yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll email to you just everything looks good perfect so what I'll do I can email that over and take a look at that if you decide you're ready to pull the trigger sign it that'll come right back to me I'll countersign it because I'm in the Panadoc system all the time then I have my team of what my my counting team will send over an invoice for the setup in first month as soon as that's paid within a day or two you'll have a link set up emailed out to you you're lucky because you don't need training to get started you can hop right in and start using but then the training will come we'll get a ticket in within a day or so we'll get a trainer assigned and then the training will be scheduled to your to fit your schedule with your trainer schedule kind of as we go forward over the next few weeks and good job and run out training and set up well that sounds good perfect yeah you can send that over I will also email you back let's see what do you need you need company name address I can send you to go to yeah that's perfect I can do that and then yeah we should be good then great I will send it on over then I'll circle back tomorrow afternoon maybe we're we're closed Thursday Friday for the holiday but also go back to touch base tomorrow afternoon to make sure you got everything see if there's any questions or anything from there sounds good thanks so much Jim I appreciate your time my pleasure thank you we'll talk to Talk to you soon. All right. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye-bye.",
