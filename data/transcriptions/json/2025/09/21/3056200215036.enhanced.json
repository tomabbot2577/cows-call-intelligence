    "text": " Hi, this is Sandy. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have your voicemail here that you're having trouble in PCR. Do you have time to look over that right now? Yeah, I'm sorry. I missed your name. Oh, my name is Garrett. Garrett. Oh, Garrett, I've talked to you several times. Yeah. So look, let me back out of what I'm doing here. Hold on. All right. So when I go in, I'm going to put the phone on speaker. Hold on. All right. You there? Yeah. Can you hear me all right? Yeah, I can hear you fine. Okay. So if I go into BCR and I put in my name as a candidate, Sandy Bishop, right? Okay. Okay, so now up comes Sandy Bishop. So I go to my email address under my name, and I click on the right button, which is form letter, right? Okay. Yep. So if I click on that, it shows me form letters on the left, upper left, of names and companies. my question my first question is how do I get interview letters on there okay interview letters are um used in a specific spot inside a PCR so the the letters available to you just by going to a name record and um emailing that's that's just going to be your name letters and or your company letters. What's the point of having interview letters? I like to send candidates an email that says, here's your interview, this date and time, and here's who you're meeting. Okay, yeah. So those would be used in conjunction with like your pipeline automations, or you can use it with your kind of like if you have a job board. So the interview letters kind of come into play there. There's also something called pipeline emails that can, and it's very similar to interview letters, But they're used with the pipeline, and you can include information like an interview appointment date and time. But those are only sent from within the pipeline. So with both of those, they just have specific areas in PCR where you're able to use the interview letters or the pipeline letters, as opposed to just opening up the name record itself. I got you so far. so staying in the same place form letters names or companies now I click on companies right yeah I've got a letter a letter says do you have urgent sales dates right so I click and when I bring it up and click on it it doesn't give me the name of the person and it just gives me hi, name, dot, first name, underscore, last name. How do I fix that? Okay, so company form letters, those are only able to reference company fields. And somebody's first name, that's on a name record rather than a company record. So it looks like you would want to use a name record or a name form letter instead of a company form letter. Company form letters can't really reference somebody's first name. Only name letters can. So what kind of info would you send on a company letter? Company letters, they're not used often, to be honest. You can only really include information about a company with those little codes, those little insert fields. the majority of the time people are just sending name letters because you can reference things from a name record like their first name or their phone number or whatever you need to reference from a name record. Okay, I get it. But who would I send a company letter to? A company? With no name? You could You could, as you're sending the form letter, type in somebody's name. You could backspace wherever it has that first name code and manually type in their name if it does contain information you want. But yeah, like I said, most of the time people aren't using company letters. They don't really have too many use cases. The majority of the time you just want to create a name form letter and then send that to whoever you're communicating with. So, by the way, I'm taking training on PCRM and, you know, simple sequence. I'm trying to figure out a way to create letters that I can send one after the other. And I thought breaking it up, you know, candidates versus companies versus interviews would be helpful. But it doesn't look like I can do that. No. Yeah. With your with your sequencing, you're most of the time just going to want to make a name form letter for all the instances, because if you're sending it to certain companies, you're actually emailing a person at that company. So you want to reference their name and stuff related to their name record. Maybe the hiring manager, you would put their name in there. So it's almost always going to be a name letter that you're going to plug into your sequences. That's the way I used to have it. Okay. I just thought it might be helpful to break it up a little bit. But that's not how you guys set it up. Okay. I got it. Awesome. Garrett, I'm cool. Okay. Yeah. If more questions come up, just let us know. We'll help you the best we can. Thank you. Appreciate your explaining. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day. You bet. Bye now. Bye.",
