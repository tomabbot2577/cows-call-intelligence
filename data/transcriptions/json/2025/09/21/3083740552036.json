    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yeah, hey, Robin. This is Rich Loeb. I was looking for technical support. Yes, what can I help you with? Great, thank you. So I had called in about a – I'm pretty sure you're going to have to dial in to my system to see. So you know how you bring in a file – when you bring in a candidate from LinkedIn, in. Okay. So, and you know, you get, you know, the, you know, the option to update. Yes. I don't, I don't have that. And then the other is, and by the way, I noticed a problem and this is what I want you to see. When I go to open up my Chrome, I have all these things along the top I've never seen before. Something is screwy in my settings and I was hoping you could help me. Okay for the issue with the capture I think if you click directly if you correct if you click directly on the extension at the top right of your browser that'll open up like like what sites it'll work on. At the very bottom right of that pop-up where it says basic mode do you happen to have that on because you'll want to turn that off. Oh, basically. It should be gray. Sorry. It is gray. It is gray. Okay. Because I was sounding like maybe. I have capture default company on. So, yeah, the different settings. What basic mode means, it's for the people that just want to be fast, like kind of add and go. It doesn't give you any review screen. So based on your description, I thought maybe that was it. And then capture to default company, That just means instead of trying to get their company, it just puts them into the default. Right. That's what I want. But basic mode is grayed out. It is grayed out. Okay. So let's do a screen share. Bear with me one second. Let me – let's see. Do you happen to have RingCentral? No, but I've logged in before. Is it RingCentral? That's okay. I'll just send you a Google. I'll just send you a Google Meet then. Let's see. Okay. I have the RingCentral login if you want. No, that's okay. I just sent you an email, and it's going to have a link to join a Google Meet. Great. Join call? Yep. And then when you are joining, it's going to ask you about sharing your camera, which we don't need because we're going to show your screen instead. And then it's going to ask you about joining computer audio. Don't join with computer audio since we are already on the phone. So ready to join, ask to join. Do I click that? Yes. Okay. Sorry, it's still doing its thing. Yep, you're in now. Okay, so here's what I'm going to have you do. I'm going to have you click on the share screen option, which is at the bottom of the meeting window. It's the rectangle with the arrow. That's going to pop up a window. Make sure you go over at the right and select entire screen and then pick which screen to show. You are show screen anyway. Okay and don't worry about that. We just go over to another tab. Don't close the me tab but just go ahead and kind of go over to something else. Okay so you see this tab Look at, see all this up here. I never had this stuff before. So that's your bookmarks bar. So if you go to the three vertical dots, those are basically like shortcuts, things that you bookmark so they're easy to get to. So if you go to the three vertical dots, go down to bookmarks and lists. Okay. then okay why is your thing so far when it's okay click with a show bookmarks bar okay then go back and hide it it's kind of weird like it said it would have This is actually hidden already. Go back to bookmarks and lists again. Okay, hide bookmarks bar. Why is yours not going away? Okay, let me think about this. Hold on one second. I told you I had a problem. Aren't you glad you got me? What else could be in there? So those are bookmarks. Okay, let's do the same thing and maybe next to reading list. Those are bookmarks though. Okay, go to reading list. Just above there. No, okay. Show all bookmarks. That's really odd. Okay, let's try this. Go to help down at the bottom right of your of that menu. So the menu kind of before it that you were in. Go to help. Go to about Google Chrome. Let's first try updating Chrome. I might leave. Okay, let's see if there's anything going on here. It's kind of weird. I mean, usually it'll say, like, whether to show it or hide it. Relaunch? Yes. Now, I still have you on the phone. If it doesn't put you right back in the meeting, I'll need you to have to go back to that email again and then rejoin, since you're rejoining through the browser. No problem. Okay, and go back to share screen. And just remember to share entire screen. Okay, looks like it's gone. If you go back to one of your other tabs, let's just kind of confirm. Oh, no, but it's still there. Okay. Let me Google this. Chrome. Why are my bookmarks showing in Chrome? one set not two. Okay so what this is saying is that your bookmarks are likely showing because you're assigned into a chrome profile that has chrome sync enabled which is syncing your bookmark settings across your signed in devices. so that could be why let's go back over to the three vertical dots again i didn't know i ever did that yeah so like i guess it's because you're signed in i mean actually how do i unsign in the bookmark options are nice though because if these are things that you go to all you have to do is click right there at the top um yeah but i don't go to this all the time. How do I... You may then need to sign out of your Google account and sign back in with a different account if you want to use a separate profile. Let's see. Chrome sync, accidents, shortcut. Let's see. Well, it's not hurting anything, correct? No, no. They're just shortcuts. If you wanted to go to PC Recruiter, you can just click up at you know one of those icons at the top left. Basically what it is is if you go down to bookmarks in that menu that you're in. But how come I can't delete why can't I delete them like if I hit this right click and hit delete and it should go away. it's not going that's the thing it's not going away okay right click it might be that sync it could be oh there that one went away didn't it delete i think it did now it's back i think it's that sync thing so you're syncing with your chrome profile um so how do i let's see how about i can unsync it right yeah i've not let's see go to settings click on you and google okay let's see to turn off chrome sync open google click the three line menu at the top right corner click settings so go down to settings click on you in Google in the left hand menu oh I can hit turn off can't I is this a setting click yeah click turn off under your account information okay now go over looks like they're off yeah so it looks like it was just a sync setting so maybe on another computer another browser maybe you have it set to show and so it's still that way um go over to the go over to one of those pages with the tabs at the left it's still all there I'm not seeing it go over to the left to like where PC Recruiter is okay are you on a different screen what sorry what screen do you want me to be on I'm what I'm seeing right now is that choose an account choose okay now you stop sharing you stop sharing oh shoot I don't know how that happened, but... You have to go back and join again. Continue without microphone and camera. Sorry, it's getting you back in. It's still... You'll join the call when someone lets you in. Oh. Is it asking to be let in? Yeah, sorry. I have a meeting coming up, and that pop-up was on top of it, so I couldn't see it. Sorry about that. There we go. Okay, so go back to share. Okay, let's go over to a new tab. And they're all there still. Okay, let's go up to the three vertical dots. Not signed in. Go down to bookmarks. okay okay I don't know not really sure because normally what it'll say is if you were to show bookmarks bar it would say hide bookmarks bar like let's toggle these let's see if that does anything and go back to show bookmarks bar again. Toggle those. Go back. When you say go back. Yeah. Go back to the settings. Not finding bookmarks. Okay, say hide. Oh, hide bookmarks bar. Yeah, but the problem is we're toggling that and it's not like changing. and I don't know why. But I mean, try to hide it. Maybe that'll do it this time. But they're still showing. I still can't even believe it. chrome colon slash slash flags so replace version with the word flags. And as you're searching for the power bookmarks, inside the flag panel. Hold on one second here. I'm not really familiar with this area. It says extensions on Chrome disabled. Is that a problem? I don't know. Now, These are just flags, though. Yeah, I'm really not sure on this. Let's go. I mean, it's not hurting anything having them there. So I don't really want to make any more adjustments to your browser without, you know, knowing why it's happening. I'm not really sure. So how about this problem where it doesn't show anything? I refresh the page and you see it doesn't have the... Okay, let's click directly on the extension. Actually, you know what? Before we do that, let's go to the manage extensions icon, which is kind of like that funny looking puzzle piece just next to capture. Oh, sorry. No, just next to it. Okay, click on the one that says PCR. Let's go down to manage extensions first. 1.2.2 Cloud bookmarks, cloud passwords. Okay, nothing there. I don't think this will do anything for us. See where it says updated at the top left? I mean, there's the current version. I'll go ahead and click that. Let's just see if it does anything. It won't. It shouldn't, but... Extensions updated. Okay. Let's click directly on the PCR capture extension at the very top right of your browser. Here? Yeah. Current user database. Let's go and hit log out. Go ahead and hit login. And then put in your PCR username, password, and make sure you check your database. Okay. You're on LinkedIn. You're on LinkedIn. Okay let's go back over to somebody's LinkedIn page and click the reload option. There's something going on with your Chrome. I'm just not sure what. Go ahead over back to the three back to the user image and click the sign in option which is up near the top. Oh, not signed in. Okay. Okay. Is that the problem? No, I don't know. Let's go to the person icon at the top. and then how would you normally sign into this I never have to be honest with you it just was automatic okay because I was saying before that you were signed in so that's why I was like not really sure oh well I guess Let's open up a new browser tab for a moment. like open Chrome down at the bottom again? Should I hit no thanks? I don't know. This might be a message that it's not sharing with me. What does it say? Oh, it says turn on sync, back up your stuff and use it on any device. Yes, I'm in or no thanks. I would say no thanks because it might be settings on your other profile that are causing it to change here. Okay, now what would you like me to do? I'm not sure yet. Oh. Because it's not really showing me anything is changing. Let's open up a new Chrome option down at the bottom. Oh, it looks like you left the meeting. I left the meeting? Yep. Did the browser close? I do see. Unbelievable. Actually, can I move this meeting over to maybe like 10, 1030? I'm supposed to be in a meeting at 930, like an internal meeting. You know what? Let's. The other thing I would try. How about restarting your computer? I can. Okay. Let's do that. And as soon as my meeting's over, I'll email you and have you rejoin with the link. Does that sound okay? Yeah, I have a meeting. It probably won't be until like with 1130 work for you. Yeah, yeah, I'm open at 1130. Here, I'll send you a new meeting link, but I'll do it for 1130. I'm really sorry. That's okay. Let's see. Okay, Richard Loeb. Loeb, L-O-E-B. Yep. I might want to check clearing cache in your browser. There's a couple things we could try. All right, CHHP2024 is connected. Ready to connect. I just sent you a meeting invite for 1130 today. Thank you. Oh, no problem. Thanks. Appreciate your help. Robin, I know we've talked before in a different – Oh, yeah. You've been there for a while. It'll be 20 years in March. We're in a different capacity? Oh, no, I do training, support, a whole bunch of stuff. All right. Training. You and I worked together on training years ago. Yeah, I've been here almost 20 years. Yeah, that's how long I've had PC Recruiter. Yes, that's been a long time. Yeah. All right, I'll let you get to your meeting. Thank you. All right. Thanks. Bye.",
