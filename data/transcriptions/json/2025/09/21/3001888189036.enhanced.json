    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. I'm wondering, I just got a voicemail from, is there a Garrett? Can you hear me? Yes. I think you put me on hold from home there. That's okay. Yeah, I did. I think I got a voicemail. Is there a Garrett there? Yes. Is he available or no? I'm not sure. What is your name? Bruce Bradford Royal. with Ottawa County. Let me see what he's talking about here. He needed me to, I need to empty out my cache. I've never, or I think that's how you say it. I've never done that before and I have no clue how. Oh, okay. I can help you with that. Okay. Let's do that. Are you in Chrome or Edge? Like what's going on? Are you getting like small email screen or things aren't popping up or something like that? It's happening on my in PCR when I'm trying to change the stages in rollups. It's super small and I can't keep my options. All right. Yep. Okay. Clearing cache will fix that. Okay. So in Chrome, what you're going to do is go at the very top right. You have those three vertical dots? Yep. Click that and then select delete browsing data, but don't do anything else once you get there until I tell you what to delete. because I don't want you tweeting things that you don't want to. And hold. Okay, and hold. So time range, you're going to set that to all time. Yep, it's there. Uncheck browsing history and cookies, leaving only cached images and files selected. That was the only thing that was selected, is cached images and files. Okay. Yeah, I just want to make sure we didn't delete other stuff on you. As long as that's the only thing, then do what? All right. then select delete data okay and then what you're going to want to do is fully exit Chrome and then go back in to your database All right. And come on. And then try to do that? Yep. And it should be fixed now. Well, pick one change you rock alright are y'all set we don't need no Garrett no we need Garrett thank you for your help no problem and I'll let Garrett know that I talked to you and that you're all set sounds good thanks alrighty thanks bye Thank you.",
