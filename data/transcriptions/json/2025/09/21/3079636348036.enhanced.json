    "text": " Thank you for calling Maine Sequel Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I'm having some issues with PCR right now. Weirdly, when I am not in an incognito window, it won't load all the way when I go to just, like, try to log in. it doesn't like it loads all of it loads everything except for the place where I might put in my username and password but then when I went into an incognito window which I just did on an off chance it loaded and then but in that incognito window when I'm sorry that sounds like you have something in your browser that might be keeping it from loading Yeah, so I updated my browser today, and nothing else is having a problem. Do you have any Chrome extensions running? Not to my knowledge. What type of computer are you using? I'm on a Mac. Okay. And then do you use a VPN by chance? I don't, although I should. Well, VPN can cause issues like that. No, well, that's why I don't. I'm like, all right, I'll, you know. All right, let's hop on a quick screen share here so I can take a look for you. I really appreciate it. And what's a good email address? Well, of course, you know what? I just, it just loaded. I'm the non-incognito so let me just see if the other issue has resolved itself before I make you because the other thing was that when I would like try and, it doesn't matter, let me see if it works and if it does then I will release you and chalk it up to gremlins Was it logging you out? It wasn't logging me out it wasn't even letting me log in when I wasn't in an incognito window and then now it let me write in, and once I'm not in incognito, it was fine. So, you know. Yeah, could have been a temporary network flip too, especially with updates. Because what can happen sometimes is when browsers update, especially if you leave your computer out overnight or just put it to sleep, the cache can get stuck, causing it not to load properly. and sometimes it just takes a while for it to clear itself out there. Okay. Well, I appreciate you holding my hand like this. Thank you for your help. It's like taking your car to the mechanic. As soon as you take it in, it stops making the noise. You know, yes. Yes. But thank you all the same. I really appreciate it. I hope I'm your hardest problem to solve today. Yeah, me too. All right. Have a great day. You too.",
