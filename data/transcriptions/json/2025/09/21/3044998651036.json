    "text": " Thanks for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. I need a little help with timesheets. Okay. What can I help you with? So we have one of our contractors that is on assignment, and the timesheet was approved and closed, but it's bi-weekly and she started on an off day so the time sheet is closed and she can't add additional hours. Okay. Let me think about this here. Which database is this in? It's Robert Peskind. Okay. So I believe that's probably just that one well it's probably because let's see contract so it's period ending 8-10 okay if I go into edit and I go into hours it's all closed out but it shows zero hours for August 4th through August 8th where she can't go in and edit okay well let's see okay so yeah somehow it went to any chance you happen to change the dates of the timesheet or anything that change the dates of the timesheet yeah like the period ending or the frequency like the pay period I didn't change anything okay so somehow she I wonder if I If I could go in and put the hours in on this one. You should be able to. Yeah, you should be able to. The other thing that you would be able to do. So if you go to contract, go to hours. I'm on there right now. Okay, Kimberly Engler. Okay, click time sheet. I'm in there. I'm in hours. Yep, I'm in there. Okay, so you see the current time sheet period, and then go to action, select edit. Yep. I'm in there so she's got hers from last week and then it's zeroed out Monday so if I go in yeah you should be able to do it the other thing that you might want to do if it does really need to go back to the approver again is over in that left navigation where you have hours there go two spots down where it says approvals yep maybe clear that out and just say in process where it says status. Let's just say that. Because it won't let the, if it's been approved you wouldn't want a contractor going in and adding more without another approval process. So that's why she would be locked out. Yeah let's see all right so I cleared details. Yeah because we had closed it out once that other times because she started on a Thursday the week before. So really she's getting paid from Thursday, July 24th through August 1st today. And so it's like it's all screwed up and off. It's going to be off. So what you might want to do is like if she is going to be weekly going forward, makes sure that in her placement record that if it is going to be weekly, that it's set to weekly. So the next time she creates a timesheet, it is only one week. Because when a new timesheet is started, it's based on what's in the placement record. So if this one was just going to only be one that was two weeks and you need your next one to be one week, just make sure that the contract record is set to – because right now you have it every time she creates a timesheet, it's set to biweekly. Let me call her with you on the line real quick and just make sure this works. Hold on one second. Okay. Hey, Kimberly. Good morning. Morning. Hey, sorry about all this. That's okay. I actually have a PC recruiter on the line as well. So I just changed the details so that it shows that this pay period, because we started on that Thursday, got everything kind of out of whack. Right. So that's why I just want to make sure if you can't do it, I can manually go in for this week and do it for you. But you should be able to, because I changed it back to in process, instead of approved when Alex approved it. Yeah, it is letting me add hours. You're just going to want to make sure that you work with your team so that they don't double pay me for that past week. Right. Yeah, no, we have it all documented. So we're good. And I have one of the reps from PC Recruiter on the line too. So if you can't do this, you know, I was going to make it easy. You're planning on working eight hours today? Yeah. And all the other days this week were eight hours? Yesterday was seven. I had to leave a little bit early. Okay. It would be better for her to actually put it in because then when she's done with the end of this pay period, that's when she'll want to hit submit for approval. So you don't want to do a submit for approval like midweek if there's going to be more hours. Okay. Okay. All right. So you should be able to, if you want to just check it while she's on with us. Let's see. Like she can go in and add hours every day. Just wait to submit for approval until the entire timesheet is complete. I just put the 8 in for today because I know I'll be here all day. Okay, yeah, it's all in there. Okay. Yeah, it should be, everything should be moving smoothly from here on out and we'll make sure that with the direct deposits that it comes to you on the Thursday, so make sure it's in your account on the Friday. Yeah, that would be awesome. I just, the weird part for you is just going to be the fact if they're not able to make it weekly, that the pay period is going to be off. Yeah, I mean, we're going to, we'll, all you have to do is worry about you putting your hours in and then we'll take care of all the other stuff. Okay. Yeah, don't even worry about it. I just wanted to make sure you can get back in and I can check it right now. Let me just see. This week. Okay, perfect. Okay, perfect. Yep, we're all good on this end. Okay, great. All right, thanks, Kimberly. Thank you. All right, thanks, Rob. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye-bye.",
