    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Julian Rees with Chapo Solutions. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Thanks. I had questions on generic file map or importing. Okay. Imported. Gotcha. B files, kind of where my head's at. The first question, I'll tell you what I'm trying to accomplish. The quickest, most efficient way to import multiple CSV files into PCR without doing too much, yeah, without it taking too much time, essentially. And I have files that have – and correct me if I'm wrong. Did we connect earlier, like two weeks ago or a week ago? Possibly. I know you talk with a lot of people. Yes, sir. Okay. Basically, I have – see, a CSV file has columns with a lot of different data, like a lot of different data. And it's coming from Salesforce, essentially. And so, it's data I would like to have in there, but maybe only a couple I would really want. And so, if I import these columns and I just map them to customized field, and there is not a customized field for it, it will create a new customized field and put the data in there. Is that correct? That's correct. And it will create the custom field based on the exact title of that column. So if you name that column like, you know, email secondary, that's exactly how it will display as a new custom field. And if other. If I do one Excel file and the other one has a column with the exact same name, it would import it into that column. or that customers field that already exists then at that point. Yeah, because you created it with the first one, yeah. Okay. That might save me. Importing the keywords, like into the keyword field. Oh, right, yeah. If I wanted to do multiple, like, hey, how does that work? And if I wanted to, in one column, let's call it keywords, and I had multiple keywords in there, how does it differentiate and separate them, et cetera? Good question. So for the keywords specifically, well, anywhere in your CSV file, you don't really want to use commas because comma tells the system it's a new cell. So if you have multiple keywords, instead of commas, you need to put the double, it's two bars. It's the pipe. I don't know what they call it, actually. Above your enter key, if you hold shift, there's that straight line. You'll want two of those double bars in between each keyword term rather than a comma. That will separate those out so you can have a list. I think the only limitation is there's 250 character limit for each cell. So if there's too many keywords, it might start cutting things off after 250 characters. Because, like, I have a lot of tags from, like, half of me thinks. Otherwise, for a customized field, is it unlimited or is it still 250 characters? It's still 250. Oh, man. Can you have it mapped to two – one column mapped to two different fields in PCR? are? Oh, I've never tried that, but I imagine you can use that drop-down to map to different fields. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's like, hey, put it here and also put it here. Yeah, I imagine you can, because it doesn't disappear from the drop-down if you go to map that, you know, same column to a different destination field. As you map them, they don't disappear from the list. So, imagine you can point it in two places. Okay. Another thing, if I had columns that all said notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes. I'm just thinking, I'm thinking out loud, like, could I import multiple columns to the notes and they create multiple notes? It would, no, yeah, you can only, so the destination would be notes. So you can only choose one column to send to that. You would probably have to combine the notes in there into one column in your CSV file, most likely. And that's still the 250 character limit and the double bars separates the notes? Right. Yep. Okay. We do have, let me think here, we do have an option. If there's stuff you really need past 250 characters, There is a way to import by making a Microsoft Access database file. I could find maybe instructions for that, if that's something you want to explore later on. If there's, you know, things past 250. Yeah, no, I appreciate it for sure. If you imported notes, does it import the column header? No, it'll just... Just the cell data. Just the cell data, yep. Multiple import. Duplicate found. Basically, I've separated it out by lists, and I'm going to import it list by list by list, if that makes sense, like roll up by roll up by roll up. And then there's a final CSV that has everybody. Oh, okay. I am thinking the best way to duplicate check that when I do the final one. I don't know if I'm going to do the final one or not. But probably his first name, last name, and then update if found. The only options there will be, they don't have one just for first name, last name. It would be first name, last name, company name, I think is the safest one to use. There is one thing I always, whenever I'm training on this, to point out with that duplicate checking. If you use duplicate checking criteria that includes any blinks, so if you said first name, last name, home phone, and you had even one blank cell for home phone, then it'll cause problems. PCR will say, oh, blank. I see that value matching perfectly to other records, and it'll start merging things. So just make sure that your duplicate checking criteria is a column that has no blinks. So usually the safest is first name, last name, company name, because most of the time people have all of those filled out. Just a kind of a warning. When importing, one thing I learned, thank you for reminding me, is just to put an X if there is a blank field. So true. Yeah, you can put an X, but it'll it'll still it'll still say, oh, X, that's a perfect match to this other field that has an X. These are. Yeah, it's kind of differentiated. Yeah, I would definitely steer clear of that. But, yeah, just try to choose the criteria that has no blanks or something like that. Do you have all the company names for each person? Is that like a column in your CSV file? Thanks. That's a great question. Most of them should have. I mean, I see some of them that don't. If they don't, those need to be basically just filled in. Yeah, with the company name, you can... And like my default company name? Yeah, your default. I was just going to say you could put that in any of the blanks and they would all go there. Yeah, that might be a good solution there. That helps. Import field notes. Keyword importing. Yeah. Do the keywords have to already exist or it will just import it into the database? Yeah, that's fine. And it won't create a new keyword in your back end list, but it will add that data into the record. So they'll all import. It's just it won't be like a clickable selection for other records in the future, if that makes sense. Ah, yeah. I would have to go in and import it into the keyword. yeah if you want that one to be like one of the clickable selections but it still will import to that exact name record keywords to the name work and i could yeah still search by it yes yeah got it It will create panning can still search. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Yeah, I'm thinking like the – oh, no. I could do that and slice it out. I'm thinking out loud because I have them all on different lists and I'm thinking through like either I do multiple imports and have it organized by the list, by the roll-up list I want to see. Okay. Or I could do one and then separate it out by the customized field that it's on. Oh, I see. So if you make a customized field and then identify them that way to break them off into roll-up lists later? Yeah. Okay. And I'm like – Otherwise, like, my strategy is, like, do you want to go one by one? And if, essentially, if it finds a duplicate, my first name, last name, it would still be on both roll-up lists. It would just update it. It would try to update it. Yeah, it will be on exactly both roll-up lists. Yeah, let me think here. Is there a better chance? Yeah, I think that's just going to take, I mean, it's a longer route because you do have to map the fields each time. Right. So that might be the time saver to do the large list, but I don't, yeah. Yeah, once. It's like once, but then I'm going to have to totally separate them out. I'm going to need the double bar cadences. Oh, okay. I'm like deep into like, how much time do I think about this versus just like start importing them. Right. No, yeah. It sounds like a big task, but you sound like you got it well thought out so far. Yeah. Anything else I should be thinking about or aware of? I think, yeah, I guess just the main thing I always tell people is about that duplicate checking criteria to not have any blanks there. If you if you pay attention to that, it'll save you the headaches of having to delete things or restart over. But, yeah, usually that's the main problem. yeah and then see if you have every once in a while somebody will try to do an import where they have multiple phone numbers in one cell separated by a comma that's the other common one those have to be in you know their own separate columns because we can't map a pair of phone numbers to a single field like cell phone so you would need a cell phone field and then make maybe cell phone two or secondary phone. That's the other real common one we see. Yeah. But that begs the question on extension numbers. How does that need to look if you have extension numbers passed it? Oh, you can. Yeah. If you just continue the phone number and add more numbers than the seven plus area code, it'll add the trailing last few numbers as the extension automatically. Okay, great. I'll have to do any special characters or anything there. Yeah, that's good. Cool. Awesome. Thank you for the help. Yeah, no problem. It's dangerous. I don't screw it all up. Yeah, best of luck. Just let us know if any other questions pop up. Awesome. Thank you. Take care. Bye. Thanks. Bye.",
