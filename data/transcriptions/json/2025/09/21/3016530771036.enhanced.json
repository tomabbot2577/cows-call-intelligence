    "text": " Hello, this is Connie Rose. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received your voicemail. You're having trouble in PCR? Yeah. Sorry about the loss of your family. I got the voicemail. Oh, yeah. Thank you so much. Now I'm trying to, what was the voicemail I left? Because I'm in five different directions. You mentioned about notes. You're having trouble editing them. Yeah. Yeah, what happened is I was getting in messages which needed to be added to the candidate's file. And there was like four or five of them that came in, and they came in at different times. So I was copy-pasting them from the text. One time he gave them through a text, and another time he came in through an email. He was driving to Wisconsin, so I think when he stopped to get gas or something, he was trying to fire off this information. That's what I think of that. So I copy pasted it in. But of course, now I have like four or five notes for the same day. And I was wondering if there was an option to combine them. And I thought, well, I'll just copy paste and put them all on one document. But then I didn't see a place to edit notes. I see. So, yeah, right now I just logged in as your admin user of your database and I'm checking on your user security. security. I have a feeling that the Connie, yep, there it is. The Connie username is set for notes. You're set to add only rather than editing or deleting. So your admin user would have to adjust the permissions for the Connie username to have more flexibility with notes. Thank you. I think we had the same issue on something else. And I sent an email to my um to my boss and um he's busy and so when i speak to him every day multiple times a day um and i think he'll get around to it but for now i'll just leave it like there you know if i don't make a problem of it it won't be a problem it's just you know hopefully people will you know i was just trying to be more concise and so what i'm going to do moving forward is i'm going to take all the notes that someone sends me like that and um i'm if i get a bunch back to back like that that's not that's that's very uncommon very uncommon but um i'm gonna do some more ai and get into a little concise summary and then oh there you go one note yeah yeah that's you know but hey you know i'm learning your software i'm learning some other software that we have here And at the same time, I am building out titles, designations, what each one of these means, what's a junior, mid-level, senior level. So I'm trying to get those so the owner can input specialty codes. Because in the area where you have the specialty codes, I'm in one right now where it says title selection. My specialty is insurance, all lines. And it's vast. There's a lot of insurance type of positions. Right. OK. I mean, I've been working on this list two days now and I'm still adding because you forget. Right. You forget. And then you go, oh, wait a minute. I forgot about where I was. Oh, wait a minute. I forgot about some of these specialty underwriters are oil and gas and, you know, some of the other ones, you know, cargo and hull. And, you know, so I'm trying to add because these specialty niches like that, you've got a place for niches here on your board. they bring big money because they're very hard to get most recruiters not they cannot move in that space and so i can and so it's just real helpful i am putting in the notes you know their designations and of course that appears on their resume so it's not like it's not there but we're looking for a place to put it inside the company like just a minute ago i titled and I'm looking at an adjuster. He's a senior person, and so there's no title for him. And my boss, he's working on the title. He's adding to specialties and adding to titles as I put them in the spreadsheet. Oh, there you go. We're working hand-in-hand with that, you know. So it's just going to take a little bit of time. And I'm on the ground. I'm asking for business. I'm reaching out to people because I'm waiting on my data Thursday afternoon or Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Not that it matters to you, but that's been the promise date from my IT company because I brought a book of business with me. Oh, okay. We create a CSV file, comma, separate value, that's CSV file, so we can upload it to the company. and then that's when those titles and that kind of thing is really going to come into play. It may solve some of our problems, but it could probably create other problems. Quick question. I'm going to work created there. Yeah, that makes sense. Go ahead. Yeah, I got a quick question. I'm glad you called me. Regarding attachments, now when I worked solo with my staff and agency for over 20 years, I had a lot of attachments. You know, they had to fill out an application. They had to fill out lots of, you know, I-9s and, you know, all types of legal documentation. And all those files are saved. All the notes are saved going back many years. And I tried not to have that be saved and uploaded because I just really wanted the resume and the client database so I could send a bulk email to all my clients. and then just resumes, right? And any resume that's outdated, pop it over to offshore and let them figure that out. Well, I was told it's not, you can't pick and choose. You either don't bring any of the documents over or attachments, which would include resumes, or none. You got to bring them all because you can't onesie twosie, right? Gotcha. So it's going to be something else. Trying to figure that out. Yeah, it sounds like a lot of documents there that you might not want. Oh, my God. Just think about it. I started in 2004. Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah, and I was very thorough. Contracts that I don't need anymore. But we're going to have to figure that out as we go. And I'm sure Kevin will be calling for sure. Yeah, that's totally fine. Yeah. He's got full authority, much further than me. But yeah, so regarding that notes section, I'll let Kevin know what I'm needing tomorrow morning. I need admin approval, which I don't think I'm going to get. I really don't want it. But he might be able to give me some approval on certain things, you know. Right, yeah, just maybe the notes section. He can adjust your permissions for name record notes and give you a little bit higher. So you can edit and delete notes, maybe, something like that. Right. You've got to control, right? I get the process. You've got to control because if not, your data could get really messed up. True. Right. Real quick. And then nobody's happy, right? Right. Anyhow, I appreciate you and I'll let you have the rest of your afternoon back and I'll be talking to you guys down the road, I'm sure. Sounds great. Have a great rest of your day. Reach out if you need anything else. I will. Thank you. Bye.",
