It's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. I had you down on my calendar. I think you're back from your trip and all your traveling. I wanted to give you a quick call and follow up, just kind of touch base, see if you had any additional questions about PC Recruiter or if you were perhaps getting ready to make a move and get set up. Give me a quick call and know how I can help, or if there's maybe a better time in the future, I should check back. I can be reached direct at 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I am going to be in Monday through Wednesday of this week. We're off a couple days for the holiday, but that will be back on Monday. Give me a quick call. Let me know how I can help. Hope you're well. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
