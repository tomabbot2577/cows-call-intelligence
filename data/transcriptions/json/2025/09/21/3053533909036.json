    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. This is Tyler. Happy to help you. Yeah, hi, Tyler. This is CJ Owens with Summit Employment. How are you doing, CJ? Hey, I'm doing good, man. I just need to get – I got a new employee that needs the, I guess, the PCR training sent to her so that she can get started on it. I sent Jim a message last week. He may be on vacation. Jim Wise yeah and then I had my employee call so Jim Wise is no longer with the company he retired oh did he that might be the problem and then so I had them call you guys and they said that you need to talk to me about it first let me see here uh yes so that would be because you have a training ticket with jason let me see if he is available here real quick for you okay looks like he's on the other line what i can do i can transfer you to jason's voicemail because he's the trainer that's assigned to your account and has that training ticket for you is there any way that he could just send that i'm traveling right now? Is there any way that he could just send that training to her? So he would just need, so he just needs to confirm with you that she can schedule that training session. Because you have one hour of training left. Can I do that with you now before I, I'm traveling, so I'm getting ready to hop on a plane. Yeah, let me just do, do, do. Let me find that ticket real quick. Thank you. And I'll just throw a note in there to him that I talked to you. Thank you. And have him reach out to her. Okay. And about what timeframe should I tell her? That I'm not 100% sure. I don't know what Jason's schedule looks like. Sure. today, but I'm guessing probably either today or Monday at the latest, he'll reach out to her so they can get something scheduled. Okay. Sounds good. Alrighty. I'll leave that note for Jason to reach out to Callie and then they'll get it set up. Alright. Appreciate it. Yep. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye.",
