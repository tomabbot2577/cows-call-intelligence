    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Sorry, say Robin. Robin, yes. Hi, Robin. I just have need assistance with PPR because I just noticed that there are some roll-ups that I have access before, but when I search it under the roll-up name, I cannot find it. But when I use a different computer, it's allowing me to search it. So it's kind of weird. Like right now. Okay. I wonder if you have any filters in place. When you go to roll-ups on your main toolbar, do you have anything where it says roll-up name? Nope. Okay. Where it says category. Does it say select category? Yes. It says select category. okay okay and then at the right of there where it says show recent versus show all show what is it it says show all yep okay so you're not under show recent because that would be a different view or it'd be just showing you the ones you went into recently show all yep okay what is your name uh my name is karen and our company's targeted recruiting group. Okay. Let me see. And then the usernames that you have selected, are they with your username? Like maybe it's something with the users that are selected? For the username, everything is checked so I don't think that's an issue. Okay and what username are you logged in as? Garen A. Gamu, DMU. Okay, so if you go into roll up, that, that, that, so then selected. I see you in the show recent mode. So where they had the show recent show all that blue slider is over at the right, not at the left. Yep. Okay. It's in the right, decide, show all. Okay. And what is the name of a roll-up that you feel you're missing? Let's see. I'm going to go on to that. Let me just. I see seven pages. I see seven pages. How many do you see? PN Alert 5. That's the name of the roll-up. PN Alert 5.22.25. Okay, I see that one. If you just type where it says roll up a name at the top left, just type CN. Does it come up? It's only showing me CN Layoff 24-7, CN Layoff Prompt, CN MKP Campaign. That's the only one that I can see. There's only three results. Okay, that's really odd. Okay, those have the username of Todd. Okay, when you go to username, the filter at the top, how many are selected? Seven are selected. Including Todd? Yes. Okay. That's very odd. I think we're going to have to do a screen share because I'm not able to see that, like what you're saying. Hold on one second here. I'm going to send you a link to join. Yep. And then when you join, it's going to ask you about computer audio. Just go in muted or don't join the audio. Sure. Since we're already on the phone. Where are you going? Just send it in right now, please. So you should be getting an email any moment now. Oh, okay. Hold on. And it'll come from Robin at Main Sequence. I definitely I just read something. Oh, there. Okay. Oh, this is Google Meet. Hello. Oops, hold on. I'm sorry. There we go. Okay. Now can I share my screen? Okay. So we have, yeah. So you're going to hit share screen down at the bottom, but go over to where it says entire screen. Okay. Now you see my screen. Okay, let's go over to PC Recruiter. Okay. Okay, so when I search here, you said you asked me to search CN first. Yeah, CN and then hit enter. on your keyboard it's giving me three results that's the result and either name everything is jack including todd recent we are in show all private roll ups are also included category select a category it's not giving any but this is the roll up that i'm looking for B is zero results. Can I have you try logging out and going back in? Let's just do it. I'm logging on to the same thing. Let's go and see. Log out. Log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. I'm going to log in. Okay. And it happens not just for this roll-up, but for other roll-ups too. Yeah, it feels like it's something with your view, which is kind of odd. Okay, let's go to roll-ups. Let me search that back. Let me start with DN. Still the same result. There's only three. Okay. Clear that out. This is so weird. Okay. They're not. Something's different here. Okay. I'm going to redo each one of these selections. Okay. Where it says category. Let's go into that drop down. Switch it to something else and then go back to where it says select a category. Just pick anything. And then go back to select a category. You want me to search it back again? Yeah. No. Just type, okay, CN, and you're hitting enter after that? Mm-hmm. give me three results. Okay go where it says username uncheck all and then reselect all. For there now it's showing if you unselect everything. Okay let's go back and hit select all click roll-ups on the main toolbar I just want to refresh go to roll-ups on the main toolbar if you made that change yeah just to make sure that it sticks okay now say now just type CN for roll-up name and hit enter. Enter. Now it's C, it's giving me more options now. Okay, well they all start with C-N. Yep, because earlier when we checked C-N, it's just giving me three options. Yeah, it seemed to be something with not recognizing Todd, I guess. So that list is under his name, right? Yeah, it's got just- Yeah, it's just, I'm not sure, but that seemed to have fixed it. So should I do that for those rollouts that I'm not seeing? It probably was a list under Todd. Do you remember another list name? Just maybe start doing that. Yeah, monthly distribution for newsletter. Hold on. Yeah, let's see. Under category newsletter. Oh, I think right now it's showing up when we do the reset for the username. I don't think you need to. I think I fixed it. If it's showing up now, I think something it wasn't recognizing that you had Todd selected is what it's showing. Yeah. So this one, newsletter distribution, it's not showing up either before. Yeah. That also has a username Todd over at the right. So I feel like it was like maybe looking selected, but really wasn't somehow. That's weird. Yeah. Okay. That was also the last name in the list, though, too. So... I don't know. We didn't really look at it. But it seemed to be like for some reason his were hiding. Yep. But thank you so much for that one, Robin. It's very helpful workaround. You are welcome. Have a great week. I just have one question. Just one more question. I've asked to see you last time. I believe I spoke with you most of the time when I called CS. When I do bulk edits regarding the opt-outs, hold on. let me just pull that up because i just want to learn more about it hold on let's see the end um can i stop sharing now or no i i think i have to share uh one sec this is about the opt out thing uh let's see one sec I want to show you again just give me more time Okay, so for the bulk, for the opt-out, you said that's going to be for category, right? Mm-hmm, which is right below the letter. So that is only for a campaign. So the one at the right is a campaign category. It's really just used to say this is a campaign that we sent that's about job opportunities. Really, that's only used in analytics. In the summary area, if you just wanted to limit by certain types of campaigns, where the category underneath the letter option is really your opt-out category. So there are two different categories. One's a campaign category. and then the category shown so it's behind the screen the category directly below the letter yeah that's related to opting in and opting out i see okay that makes sense because that's our question it's gonna be there's like two categories here okay one's a campaign category so like somebody could like would have to do like the opt-out category which is that one right below letters but they may not even have mail campaigns so they're two separate ops two separate but we can put an email category right what we can create an email category like an added a category no these are defined as they are oh okay we can only yeah you wouldn't really want to change them too much after they've been used only because if somebody's already opted out or in and you start getting other descriptions then it could stop them from getting other things so it's just the set list I see. Okay, well that answers all my questions now, Robin. Thank you so much. That's really a big help. No problem. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. Alrighty. Bye.",
