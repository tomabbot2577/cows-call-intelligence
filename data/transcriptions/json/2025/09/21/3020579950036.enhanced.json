    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah, hey, Tyler. How are you today? Good. How are you? Good. Can't complain. Even if I could, it wouldn't do me much good, right? Yep. Hey, quick question for you. My company, we use PC Recruiter, and they told me to give this number a call to see if you could help me set up my email on PC Recruiter. Does that make sense? yeah so you just need to set up like your outgoing email yeah yeah to like be able to send bulk emails out of out of pc recruiter and stuff yeah which uh database do you log into um good question um how do i know when you say which database so like when you're logging into pc recruiter before you put in your username and password you'll see your database name up at the Oh, gotcha, gotcha. Let me see. One second here. It is, okay, database. It says RB-construction. Perfect. And then what is your username for PC Recruiter? Yeah, TWL. Right. And then do you need the password as well? Nope. And then do you know who hosts your email, like Outlook or Gmail? I believe it's Gmail. Let me check real quick. Yes, it's Gmail. All right. So first thing we're going to do is you're going to go to System up at the top. oh sorry do you want me to log in oh yeah go ahead and log into pcr all right here we go okay system up at the top yep and then email setup and then email alias list okay and then you'll see down at the bottom half of the screen there's like it says PC Recruiter email address. You're just going to click that little pencil next to it. Okay. Perfect. And then you're going to, in the from and reply to address, you're just going to put your email address in both of those. Okay, so in the from address, I got trey, T-R-E-Y, at rockbridgesearch.com, and then put that same thing in the reply to address? Yep. Okay, got it. And then you're going to do that sign in with Google option. Okay, one sec. And then you'll just follow the prompts. Google. Choose an account. Trade at rockfordsearch.com. And then. Yeah, you'll accept all the stuff it asks you to accept. Oh, and then when it says select what, there's a send email on your behalf. I want to check that, right? Yep. Okay, boom. Boom, okay. And then go ahead and hit save. Cool, yeah, because then it came back to that edit alias, and now like the SMTP server board is filled in. Okay, so now just click save. Yep, and then I just tested the connection on my end. That's all good. And then you'll see up top where it says email signature. That's where you can add in. Oh, like the signature that I use if I were to send it directly from Gmail or whatever? Yep, yeah, you can just copy and paste it in there. Okay. Okay. Then let me see if you guys are using iMap or not. Okay, beautiful. I put in that. Put in that signature and then from there do I just always include? Yep. Oh, excludes bulk mailing, is that what I want? Yes, because in the bulk mail letters there's like a mail merge field to put the current user's signature in there. Gotcha, okay. So yes, so always include signature, excludes bulk email, and then save, correct. Okay, that's all done. And then let me just check one thing here. Alright. And then the last thing we'll want to do is just set up your IMAP, which is like the incoming email so it writes those activities. Okay. Let me just check one thing here real quick. What was your username one more time for me? the username was oh right there, TWL. Perfect. I just want to make sure of one thing before Thank you. All right. So next thing we're going to do is you'll see up in the very top right-hand corner, there's that little profile picture silhouette. Right. And next to it is that little gear icon. Click on that gear icon and hit email. Okay. And then when that new tab opens up, you're going to hit configure. and then mail servers. Got it. In the bottom half of the screen, you'll see a little options icon over to the right. It's that three lines that kind of look like a cheeseburger. Got it. And you'll hit add. Okay. You'll go ahead and give it a description. So I normally tell people just call it like Gmail. Okay. Where it says save sent email to send items folder you're going to say no on that one Save sent email to set items so there's a no yep, and then you'll do the sign in with Google again Then after that's done you'll just hit save. Okay done with that and then hit save. Yep then I can go in and check out my end. Yep, that's good. Cool. And then do I just hit close after I hit save? Yeah, because what I'm going to do now is just set up your sent in trash folder for it to do its sync. And then you'll start seeing everything sync in here in about 24 hours. Okay. So, and does that mean, so like, for example, if I were to send an email out of Gmail, not like in PC Recruiter, but it goes to an email of, like, say, a candidate that's in PC Recruiter, does it automatically log that as an activity? Yes, it does. Cool, cool, okay. But, yep, so you're all set up with your outgoing and incoming email. Okay, perfection. Well, awesome. I really appreciate your help. Yep, more than happy to. If you need anything else, just let us know. Okay, thank you. Yep, have a great day. You too. Take care. Bye.",
