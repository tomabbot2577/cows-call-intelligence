    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hello, Robin. It's Jeanette. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Hey, thank you so much for that great training. We are sending out the emails to those contractors and hiring authorities today. Oh, good. Good, good, good. Yeah. But that was, we would never have been able to figure out how to add all that stuff you had. I was just coming back to that this morning. So thank you very much for that. That's a lot of bouncing around, isn't there? Yeah, yeah. I was like, oh, dear. I've never been able to do this. So I was calling. We also did training with Garrett on PCRM, which he was great to, last four days. And he sent us the directions for the PCR portal for Outlook from the Learning Center. But is there a Mac version of that? Because the tech guys like to get a bunch of people on Macs. No, you can only do the PCR portal add-in with Outlook. on a Windows computer with the classic installed version of Outlook. Okay. Good to know. Everyone can be set up with PCR mail, so at least they can get their email activities and they can download into PCR. But the portal add-in, it's a com add-in. Okay. If you go to file options, there's like com add-ins it's one of those and so that's why it's not even supported on like the new outlook or like the web version of outlook okay that's a bummer so if we were going to set up say pcr mail for the mac users is there directions for that are you office 365 or gmail office or other Okay. I have instructions that I think, hold on one second. Let me make sure. Did I update? Oh, no, it's a Gmail one. I had to update. Let me send these over to you. It's just like a Word doc. The one thing that you'll need to do is in the Office 365 admin portal, which you'll need to do for all your people is make sure SMTP authentication is enabled. otherwise when you get to the part about the alias list when they go to hit test connection it'll say SMP is disabled for the tenant and what that means is if like you go into the office 365 admin portal there is um what is it um you go to users active users you click on their name and then there's like your like manage email apps or things like that it'll check off like things like IMAP stuff like that but they by default don't enable SMTP authentication meaning that okay you can't like use it outside of like Microsoft products or something so that has to be adjusted in Office 365 otherwise they'll go through all the steps and once you set it and that's just for the Mac users right is that for everybody anybody that's going to use Office 365 within within PCR mail. Okay. Or actually, even if they just do their email alias, you have to have that SMTP authentication. So they need to change that for everybody, right? Basically everybody to use the PCR like this? Yeah. Office 365, they have it turned off by default. Okay. In case someone just signs in and still can't send it to you. So it's basically saying, yeah, even if you're authenticated, you can still go ahead and send me or send as me using like some other application okay great well thank you yeah let's see okay I just sent you the document and that will record their activity in VCR it just like the pain that the pain that you look at inside of Outlook? Correct. Okay. It's really just for email. Yeah, at least it's just for email. But especially if someone's going to have like if you're going to have like analytics and sequencing, everybody should have PCR mail anyway, because that's going to be required to like, let's say if you're doing a mail campaign, you have to have PCR mail because that email, like say if it's a reply to a campaign or a sequence, it has to come in through PCR, I'm able to read the tracking image. The Outlook portal can't do that. Okay. Okay. Well, thank you. And I just got your email too. So I'll send him to that and then we'll just go from there. So make sure they don't skip a step in there. Like they want to do a step by step. Otherwise, he's a new IT guy and he's supposed to log in as people. So we'll see what happens with this. Okay. Thank you, Rima. I appreciate it. Also, if you're going to have one person doing it for others, you're probably better off going in an incognito window when you log in as a PCR user. Otherwise, like if, let's say you already sign into your Office 365 account, it'll try to just sign you in however you're logged in. So if you do it in incognito window, that'll help. Great. I will remind him of that too. Thank you. You've been very helpful as always. alright well have a great week hey you too we're almost at the weekend alrighty thanks okay thank you talk to you later bye",
