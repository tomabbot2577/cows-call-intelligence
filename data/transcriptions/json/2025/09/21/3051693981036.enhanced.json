    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press . You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Hey, sorry. I forgot all about this meeting, so I apologize for being late. No problem. No problem. I just was waiting a few more minutes to see if you couldn't join us or join me. Is Jonathan on? No. No, he is not. I don't know that I ever got an accepted invite, so I don't know if I was expecting him fully. Let me just quickly text him a second, Jim. Hang on a second. Sure. Because it would be more important for him to be on this call than me. It's better if we both are. All right. I sent him a text, Jim, but we'll see you. We have to give him a call. We'll see if he can join. He's the only one free to call. Are we going to be sharing a screen at all? I may, because I can show you some of the new stuff you don't have with PC Recruiter, if you're interested. So I might share it. Okay. Are you going to – can I – I'm calling you from a cell phone. Can I pull up my laptop and get in that way? That way I can see better. Absolutely. Okay. So I'll be back in just a few minutes, okay? Sounds good. All righty. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye. Talk to you soon. Thank you. you you you Thank you. Hello. Hello, Jonathan. How are you? Hey, good, good. Sorry about that. I completely lost track of time. No problem. No problem, man. Brian was in. He's dialing back in. So he was in on his cell phone. Okay, good. He's dialing back in. Perfect, perfect. Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. How are you? Where are you about at, Jim? Ohio. Cleveland, Ohio. Ohio. Okay. Okay. Okay. How are things out in Cleveland this time of year? sunny and warm. So that's just, it's all right here this time of year. Really the only bad thing we have is snow, and it's not even that much snow anymore. Yeah, well, we're both down in North Carolina, and it hasn't been too bad the past couple weeks in terms of the heat. We've actually had a lot of rain and stuff, which has been good because I've been dealing with a lot of AC issues the past several weeks. That's no good. Luckily for Jonathan, it's only been like 115 degrees here. I'm back on my cell phone. I'm just waiting for my laptop to boot up and all that stuff. When I get out of the laptop, I'll get off the cell phone. For sure, for sure. All right, yes. I wanted to talk a little bit about your PC Recruiter account and talk about some of the new stuff we have. I wanted to see, kind of, did you have any questions initially that led to you originally reaching out, or any thoughts or things you've heard about that you want to see, or anything like that? No, I talked to, we read some past two invoices that were going to an old email account that we weren't using anymore. So as soon as I found out, I go, oh, my God. And then, I don't know, Jonathan, did we have anything in mind? Did we say we had something better? I think it was just the way the invoice was laid out, it was, you know, we have an a la carte service, I guess. Right. And we didn't really know what each of the things we were being billed for were. And we just wanted to make sure, whatever they were, they were things we were using. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Sure, yeah. So let me look. Let's see if I have that. I had the invoice open for a little while here. Yeah. So, Jim, it's just Jonathan and me now in our company. And the more I can avoid PCR, the less it screws up Jonathan. So, you know, he uses it all the time. I use it when I have to kind of thing. but I just want to make sure that we're paying for stuff that we're using. Sure. Sure. Let me see. I don't even have the invoice at hand. Let's see if I can find it here. Yeah, if not, I can probably forward an email we got from your billing person. Yeah, if you can forward that along, that's easier to find because, like I said, I don't have – I had it open and I closed it and I don't even know – I think it came from Robin. Yeah. It came from Robin. Yeah. Jonathan, my laptop's booting up. Do you have that access? Yeah, hold on. Let me see here. Here's one of them. So I will just forward it to Jim. Yeah. I'm Jim at mainsequence.net. Okay. So is Main Sequence still under the same ownership it's been under for years and years? Yep. Yep. Still the same ownership, but no changes there. So is he still surfing? Yeah, not as much, I think. He's been here for most of the summer. All right. I just forwarded it. You all run an older antiquated pricing system. Actually the pricing that you're paying per user for I think it was literally one nickel more per user per month. You could get the premium plus with PCRM, our new product. You could get everything the PC Recruiter offers for a nickel more than what you're paying out per month per user. Let's learn about that and see if it's stuff we actually, you know, that's why Jonathan's on the call. The stuff that he says, oh, God, that'd be awesome. I'd use that. That's great. Yeah, so let me look at it. So I'm opening up the invoice that we have right now. If I was a customer and I came and I got the same exact services I have today, would I get them from us? You would, yeah. Because what you're doing now, so you're, like I said, on this older pricing. We started packaging the features a few years ago, and your package usually probably would be, I think you're on enterprise package, which would be about $95 per user per month. And you're paying $124.95 per user per month because you're on the older pricing there. So your invoice, to kind of break it down, the ASP, that's basically PC Recruiter, and that is the two users at $49.50 per user per month. Then the software portal, that is the Outlook integration. So that is the portal for Outlook. That's that Outlook integration, that piece that puts PC Recruiter into your Outlook. That's $24.95 per user per month times two users. So that is kind of another piece that's included in the Outlook. I don't even know what that is. What's Outlook integration? What does that do? Inside of Outlook, you can actually have an additional tab added that is PC Recruiter. recruiter. So you could open PC Recruiter up in your Outlook. You could also sync your calendar, sync your emails. It gives you the ability, if you right-click on an attachment, you can parse it right into the database. So it looks like that's the portal is what you have there. It's something that's loaded into your Outlook. Okay. Do you use that, Jonathan, or do you want to use that? I've used it before. I found that it would crash a lot in the past, and I don't remember how to reconnect it either, so I haven't used it in a while. But basically, the one thing it did that I thought was useful was that it would, you know, if you send an email to a candidate that's in PCR, it saves it as an activity or whatever on their profile in PCR. So that's certainly useful. It just seemed like it would cause my Outlook to crash a lot, I felt like. Sometimes it does. Back in the day, and it's gotten better now, it used to conflict with a lot of other add-ins in Outlook. So if you had Microsoft Teams add-in in there or a few others, it wouldn't crash it sometimes. That has improved, but that was an issue at some point. So that's... Is that a feature you'd like to have, Jonathan, or even if it worked, would you just not use it? Well, I mean, like I said, I think the fact that it captures emails and then writes them into an activity, that's useful for us because we can go in and pull up a candidate's profile and not have to necessarily search through our inbox to find an email or something. It would automatically save it right there to their profile in PCR. So I do think if it's gotten better, it certainly would be beneficial. Okay. Well, we want that done, Joe. But I'll never use it ever. Do I need to be paying for it if Jonathan's paying for it? Well, it is because it's database-wide, so your users have to be on the same level because everything is there. Okay, true. But that's why we started bundling it so that you get everything. It's not a la carte like this. Now, it looks like you're actually also on – so we have Enterprise, Premium, Premium Plus. You're kind of on Enterprise and a half almost because you actually have one premium feature. Because you were a la carte, somebody at one point just added the analytics dashboard. So it looks like you have that analytics dashboard. Do you use that at all? No. I don't know. Yeah, I don't even know what that is. No. And I wouldn't use – it's just the two of us, Jim. So, you know, I'm not like on a team and, you know, seeing how Jonathan's doing versus other people. Okay. So that is something you're not using. Yeah. At some point you were added. So that's a premium feature. Yeah. Yeah. I don't want to pay for that. The dashboard. Okay. So no, that. And then you also have the web extensions, which is the job board piece. So that's the ability to interface with your website and have jobs posted to your website from. We don't. We don't. Yeah, we don't need that either. We don't even have a place on our website that shows our job postings. Okay, okay, so that is something you wouldn't need at all. So actually, if you were doing this, I think it would still – so to keep you – so you're kind of, like I said, you're on enterprise plus one premium feature. But if you went to the enterprise package, it's $95 per user per month. So you'd be looking right now, you are paying $49.50 plus $24.95. So actually, yeah, if you went to the bundled pricing, because it also includes the new job board, you'd actually go up a little bit. So if you went to the enterprise pricing, you'd be at $95 per user per month. or if we kept this old pricing here and you dropped the features you're not using, you'd be at $74.45 per user per month. So it will be a little cheaper to keep you on this pricing but get everything adjusted. All right, let's do that. Did you need any kind of sequencing or anything like that? Because we now have a sequencing piece, email campaigns, so you can send out bulk emails and see who opened, who clicked, who replied, all of that? No. You know, we do all that through MailChimp. Okay. When we send a campaign. You know, it's just the two of us, so we're not a big off. You know, we don't need those features that much. Okay. So, yeah, so that isn't something. And then the other thing that you could do, we have, I don't know if you've heard about our new PCRM. it's like a CRM piece that is running off the same database as PC recruiter it's a newer format and then it's going to also give you a sales pipeline if you were tracking like sales and potential leads so I don't know if that no interest yeah yeah okay so yeah so that you wouldn't need to upgrade but what we could do is if you're not using the web extensions or the the dashboard I could drop a hundred bucks off so that would take it like from what 255 255 30 is what it is now so minus a hundred so that would put you at 77 65 because there's a little PPI price increase there that was just a custom price increase they put on some years ago, but it could still be $7,765 instead of the full $95 for the enterprise package. So I could keep you on your current contract here, just put in tickets to drop those additional features and drop you there if you need to. All right. That's a deal. Okay. Yeah, let me do that. And since you're not using them, you're probably not even going to notice that it goes away. You don't have the web extensions hooked into your website. Nothing you're going to notice. You can leave them there as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, you won't even miss it because you weren't even using it. So yeah, let me put in tickets to get that done and if there's anything else that you need, just let me know. Can you send over instructions on how to integrate that Outlook portal? Yeah. I'll send you some instructions. I have that. Text support can help you or I can put in a ticket if you need help on that. to go with that. Other than that, PC Recruiter, for what it's doing for you, is working okay? Yeah. It's what we're used to, and we know it pretty well. Haven't used it for a long time now. Yeah. We're satisfied with PCR for sure. No thoughts whatsoever of changes. Very good. Well, yeah, let me get the tickets. It's good. I like it. They keep improving, too. Yeah. Yeah, so if you ever have any need for, like, sequencing email campaigns, let me know because we do that basically. What MailChimp does is be integrated into PC Recruiter. Let me know on that, and I'll go ahead and get everything in action to kind of reduce your drop to things you're not using here. All right. All right, man. Well, I appreciate your time this morning. Sorry we were both – Jonathan, I realized, like, at 10.15. Oh, my God. And so, fortunately, Jim had clicked in and was patient with us. Yeah, appreciate that. I'm all coming from Worthington, Ohio. And who it was, I didn't answer it. Are you actually in Worthington? Me? No, I'm in Cleveland. Oh, I don't know the phone number I saw. I thought it said Worthington. Maybe not. I might have said Willoughby. I don't know if it says Willoughby or what it says. Oh, I said Middle East when I did. That's exactly it. Which direction are you from? East. We're about 30 miles east of Cleveland. We're up along Lake Erie. Near Warren? Kind of northwest of Warren. Warren's about 45 minutes southeast of here. All right. Got a college made from there, so I'd love to see him go golfing once in a while. well listen Jim thanks for your time today it's been helpful and we got a price reduction if that's a good thing yeah we'll do I'll go ahead and get that underway and anything else you need let me know alright thank you alright thank you both bye",
