    "text": " This is Robin. Hi Robin. Can you hear me? Yes I can. Hi Robin, I actually need help on PTR. So I'm trying to do a bulk update for PTR but it's actually not working for some reason. What are you trying to say? What is your name? Karen. And your last name? Camu. C-A-M-U. I'm sorry, what company? Targeted Recruiting Group. Got it. Okay. Alright. So what are you trying to update and how? Okay so if you, I'm not sure if you're replicating my account, but if you go to roll up, I created first a temporary, the roll-up name is temporary PJN. Okay I'd have to go to your database hold on one moment please yeah sure yeah okay what username are you logged in as can you say that again can you spell it yeah like karen and k-a-m-u So K as in Karen, C as in Charlie. Okay. For your roll up, let's see. So the name of the roll up is Sam for PJN. Okay. So what I'm trying to update here, you see that candidate status? Oh, okay. I think I know where you may be going with this. Okay, go on. Okay, go on. Sorry. Seems like you're so far. Say that one more time. I think I might know where you're going with this, but go on. Yeah, so I'm trying to do a bulk update here, which should be in the global change, right? Okay. So you're trying to change the status field, and you're running to it for every record on this list? Yeah, so I'm doing it in bulk so it would be easier for me. Okay. Okay. What are you trying to change it to? Hiring Authority. Okay. All right. So in the back end of the database, while you might see candidate or even some abbreviations, what's actually stored in the back end is a single letter. So if you want all of these names to be Hiring Authority, when you do the global change, that value has to be H. Just H. Just the single letter H, and I always do capital letters. So if you go to system, go to global change, and then select change name. Okay. First, your field name, you're going to pick your status. So that's under predefined, right? Yes, because that's not a field that you create. It's one that's part of the database. So that's where you'll pick status. and then you'll limit to roll up. Very important step there. And then where it says new value, just type in a capital letter H. Okay. And before you hit apply, just make sure you got the right roll up selected. That way you're not running it on every database. Okay. So when you hit apply, everybody should pick up hiring authority. I actually did that already. So you mean I don't have to put anything under original value or check that box that says modify only empty fields. I don't have to do anything about it, right? Correct. Correct. We just want everybody in that list, which is why it's important to pick the list, to have H for hiring authority. But if you happen to spell it out, then it picked up a wrong value that it's not recognizing. Let me try that. Yes, but just make sure you're doing just the letter H. And it looks like you did because I see a gavel next to all of them. Hopefully this will work now. But how about for if it's going to be like a candidate, should I put just letter T? Yeah. You know what? I have a list somewhere. Actually, you know how you could always tell the list if you ever want to look? If you go to name and go to advanced. Oh, yeah. I actually saw that earlier when I'm doing a search. Yeah. And then like when you pick status and then go to that picker, we actually store C for candidate, E for employee, H for hiring authority. So those are the values that you actually have in mute. Okay. Okay, so let me just double check. Oh, now perfect. It's now working. Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah, you probably spelled it out like H-A or hiring authority. Yeah, I did. But it needs to just be the letter H. So I actually picked that letter H earlier. However, I'm putting like a number on the all records plus I'm checking the empty field. And it's not doing it. Yeah, this one, as long as you get them on the list, you can just use that alone. It just depends what you're trying to change. If you need it, like, only if it's empty. But, yeah, for this need, it's probably just that you didn't have that letter. Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much, Willie. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
