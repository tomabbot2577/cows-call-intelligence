    "text": " Thank you for calling me. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Mark Dillon from NADEC. How are you doing today? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Question for you. I have a second home up in the Adirondacks. I have my computer that I have all set up with PCR on it. And I was trying to, for whatever reason, my RingCentral is not connected to this one. How do I get it connected so that I can, you know, just when I click on the little phone icon, it can dial a name for me? Do you have their app installed on that computer? Yes, I do. Okay. Let's see. So what's happening, because it should still stay connected, because really the connection is kind of pulling from the logs. Is the problem the click to dial? Yes, not doing anything when I click on it. It doesn't, whereas like if I'm at my office and I click on it, you see the RingCentral little box pop up and start making the phone call. Is it a different computer? Say that again? Is it a different computer? Yes, it is. This is a different computer. okay we probably should do a screen share can you open up your ring central app and go to video and then select join okay I'm looking at text video click on video okay okay and then go over to join or join okay and then it's going to ask you for a meeting ID yep go ahead 050-394-810. Okay. And you don't have to join with computer audio. If you did, just mute yourself. Otherwise, you're going to get a little background noise since we're already on the phone. Okay. And then let's have you click share at the bottom of your meeting screen. Got it. And go over to entire screen. And then you'll have to click on this screen to show me. And then click share. It goes select tab. Now you'll have to, so go to entire screen first. Share. Yeah. Entire screen, got it. Okay. And then click on which one to show in case you have more than one. Okay. Yeah, so this is my PCR share. Okay. Show me your RingCentral app. All right, so the RingCentral is here. Okay, I wonder if that's just... I don't think you're joined through the app though. Like if you type the word ring, so if this is kind of like their web version, we can't integrate with that. It has to be the one you download to your computer. Can you, in your Windows search area, can you type the word ring? All right. Hang on. All right. So down here, just ring. Okay. All right. And I guess you can't see this. If I move it on this side, you can see that. So it's a Windows search option at the very bottom left of your computer. Yep. And that is, yeah, that's where, so when I hit ring. Hit the word ring. There it is. That's just taking you to their website. Okay. So let me get the link. You'd have to download their app because that's the one that we would integrate with. So let's see, RingCentral. Yeah, you'd have to go to RingCentral downloads. Right here, download. Can you see what I'm looking at? You know what? Go to their – let me see. What is the link? There's one page I prefer to go to because I see everything. This is www.ringcentral.com. Yeah, but I want to make sure it's giving you the right one. Exactly. Go to that page that says download. Let's see what's on there. Right here? No, go to just below that. Download the app? But I want to see which one it is. Maybe just try their download page. Otherwise, I'll just let me give me a moment. I'll look for the URL that you usually go to. OK, so it does download app, right? Or download. Hold on one second. I don't know which one it is. I know there's a page that has like they're different ones. I just want to make sure we're going to the right one, though. Where did I? Oh, because I've made it in a group. Downloads. Here we go. What is it called? Okay, can you replace the bar at the top, the search? Replace that with support.ringcentral.com slash download.html. okay you want the one that says download for PC yeah hit it yeah I feel like sometimes when people go other places they get something different that's why I just wanna make sure we get it all right and I mean yeah for sure on that so just so quick on it I know I think that's something else go back to your downloads it looks like it said that the download was blocked download for PC right yeah well it's already down look well see over at the top right it's kind of like grayed out right now up by where you would have your just below that right next to your picture unverified download block so somehow you have your computer restricting downloads where where is that just to the left of your picture Right there. It disappeared, the little circle. Want me to search it and see if it pops up in my search thing? It's probably in your downloads folder. So if you go to, like, your file folders, go to your downloads folder. Otherwise, it seems like you have some kind of safe browsing turned on or something. Oh, what the heck. From what it sounds like. But you'd have to download and run that file to set it up so they can recognize. Right, I can just go to apps, RingCentral. Well, it's not installed yet. You have to go to your downloads folder. Oh, where the hell is that? If you go to your Windows search option, or like usually there's like a yellow folder. File Explorer. Yeah, try that. Oh, download. Okay. So it's in there, or that's where it's trying to go. Can you see that? What happens if you try running it from here? Ring Central. So it looks like it's downloaded, right? um we'd have to run the file let's see if you can open that because this was actually installed it on your computer oh and then you'll have to sign in and all that kind of stuff but once you're on your computer then it should be able to work with it um have you ever installed job do you have java launcher installed on this computer as well i have no idea i mean i i use i come up here you you know, once every a few months and work out of my, you know, a second home. Okay. So you'd have to run this. Let's also see if you have, so you'd have to run that file. Okay. It, it looks like it's almost done. Okay. Then you'll have to sign in, but in order to even pass it over, you have to make sure you have Java and launcher. Can you go back to your windows search option again? Is it Java? No, I, no, I don't know yet. Um, So close this. Go to your Windows search option again at the bottom left. Bottom left, yep. I'm not seeing where you're going. The Windows search. Are you on the screen that I'm watching? Yeah, no, I got two computer screens. So let me just open that up. Let's see. Because you can see that screen, correct? Yeah, so the window search option at the bottom of this screen? Yeah. Type in the word app, A-P-P. Yeah. And go to add or remove programs. And then close or exit out of the search that you did there. Okay, let's see. Let's look for J's. You don't have that. Okay. Okay. And then type in the word or clear that out. And go down. They're in alphabetical order. Go down to the P's. And look for P's Recruiter Launcher. Yeah, you don't have that either. So those I'll have to send you links for those because you'll need to run those files as well. Okay. Otherwise, like things like your alarms, your resume parsing screen, a whole bunch of stuff won't work. right when you're in peace recruiter but i'll get those over to you as well okay all right and then i'll i'll go in the meantime i'll i'll log into ring central make sure that's all up and going on my end and uh yeah i don't know if they're going to have a restriction like if you can have the app more than once i don't really i'm not really sure on that one um but we would require that it's that installed version. It may detect that you have it installed somewhere else. That could potentially be an issue, but I'm not 100% sure on that. I feel like I've seen that with somebody before, though. Okay. Where it would be an issue, I can only have it on. But I definitely have, whether it's on my phone, whether it's on, you know. Yeah, but I think, like, if you install their app more than once, I don't know if they let you do that. So that people can't be kind of, you know, trying to share an app, I guess, is my guess. But I'm not sure. I'm not 100% sure on it. Possibly an issue, though. Okay. And I can try to figure that out. But, yeah, if you can send me whatever you can. And it's just a lot easier where also, too, so I'm tracking everything through PCR. It logs in calls. I mean, so it's just, it's a lot easier if I do things through the PCR app. Yeah, you should probably still get like your activities because you would still have that connection through the API because we check about every 20 minutes. It's just a click to dial. You'd have to have the app on your computer. Okay. All right. And you're just going to send that over. And in the meantime, I'll get this all set up. and then I'll just, is it something that I can do once I download the other app? And does it automatically connect, or do I have to call you back? No, it should. As far as our side, you would still have your credentials stored. But you do need the Java and Launcher installed on your computer, because that's what actually passes the number over to the RingCentral app once you have it. Oh, okay, got it. All right. Well, that's, so I'll do that. And then, so bottom line is you're saying that once I download that, you're saying that you should recognize that I'm connected to PCR and it would work? It should, yes. Okay. My only concern is if you have the same app installed on two computers, does that cause an issue? Right, right. Okay. and I can I can I'll see if I can I guess worst case scenario we'll try it out and if it doesn't I'll give spectrum it's a spectrum business which is the brain central they're partnering with one central or whatever it's the train central but I'm going through spectrum business yeah ours just only passes the ring central app I mean you just still get again get your activities just that click to dial is probably what's not working right right okay all right perfect well I appreciate it thank you and I'll look forward to downloading the Java and all that and see if I can get it going okay sounds all right thank you have a great day Thank you.",
