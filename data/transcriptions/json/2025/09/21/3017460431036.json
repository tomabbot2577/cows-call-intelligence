    "text": " Thank you for calling me. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. I had a quick question. I'm using PCR's capture. And you can on LinkedIn. Let me see if I can do it again. When I'm clicking capture, it allows you to edit field configuration. But when I make edits, I can't keep them so that they remain. Oh, okay. So that same spot where you got into the edit field configuration, once you're in there, it turns to a save option. Do you have to hit save at the top right? I'm pressing save, but it's not. At the top right or at the bottom right, though? I think the top right. Okay. That should do it, then. Let's see. Here, it's still. Let me press save again. Let me go to a new one. Let's see what happens. Yeah, the talk rights don't work. But here, let me open a new one recently and see if that helps. All right, take two. Okay, that worked. I had like 10 LinkedIn's opened and I forgot I needed a brand new LinkedIn for it to reset. Oh, yeah. If you already had it open, that could be an issue too. But the other thing I've seen people do is when they go in there and they see like save or how it's labeled at the bottom, like you got to do the one at the top right. So for the ad activity, it's making me get the selector and it automatically always selects 12 a.m. Is there any way to get it just to put up the time I'm submitting it at every time? You know what? I haven't really used that one that much. Because the one thing I wish I'd had is, like, you know, do I want to put it on my schedule? Let's see. I don't think it picks up current date and time, if I remember right. I have to manually select it, which is annoying. But it's just there's a workaround. Because it's just an endless list that keeps recycling. Yeah. Now, what are you using it for? Like what kind of activity are you writing on there? Because some of these activities aren't going to be generated for you automatically. Like added or updated the record? No, I wanted to put down that I just, you know, I spoke with them, didn't connect with them or whatever. Gotcha. Okay. So do I have add activity in my setup right now? No, I do not. Let me add that in. Okay. Let me reload my page. And I am so sorry, I did not pull up your information. What is your name again? Michael Shuler. S-C-H? S-C-H-U-L-E-R. U-L-E-R. It's S-S-I. S-S-I. Okay. I got a bunch of Michael Schillers. Used to be at Spectrum, so you might have an old profile. Oh, you know what? Wait. Oh, I think I did just have that. Sorry, hold on one second. Let's see. Okay. So you said it is part of Spectrum? Is that right? Okay. No, no, that was my old company. Oh. I'm just saying, both were on PCR. Oh, okay. Well, that makes it a little bit easier for you, right? Mm-hmm. How do we have... Is there, like, a long name for SSI? trying to remember uh super systems okay yeah that sounds similar okay there we go put you in here And what's your email address with this company now? mschuler at supersystemsinc.com. Okay. All right. I think this is the one. Perfect. In the capture stage, is there anything else you recommend adding these fields that you find your people save a lot of time with? I really like the add note. So if you just want to kind of add a note, like, oh, here's something I want to know about them, or just kind of point out when I'm looking at notes, that's a really good one. The add to roll up and link to position. Those are used more often than the add activity, to be honest. Let's see. And then also that there's other fields. You don't want to put anything under overview unless it's – Overview stuff's all automatic, right? Yeah, and it's required. So you can go in – actually, you know what? An only administrator can, so you probably can't configure that part. But like I said, there's maybe like custom fields or some other fields. You can make other field groups or pick fields that go into an existing field group. so it may not pull the data but at least you could populate it as you're creating the record but the add to roll up link to position are pretty good yeah i'm seeing it doesn't pick anything okay well i didn't even know that you could edit fields i wish i knew that at the last jump it's a huge um time saver just inside of the capture yeah like if you because a lot of people are asking for things like well i want to put it in like their industry for example and then that way you can just do it at the time that you're bringing it in. Real quickly, I used to get notifications when I captured someone on my desktop that would then take me like if I clicked on it, it would pull up their profile on PCR. I no longer get those. I was messing around with my settings. It could be that you don't have your Chrome notifications enabled. Okay, let me see. It's like if you're like on Windows if you go to notifications? Yeah, I'm on Chrome. Let me try settings. No, not settings. Maybe this. Accessibility? No. Let's see. Usually if you go to, let's see. I feel like all these different versions of Windows are a little bit different. If you use your Windows search option, type in the word notifications, and at least on mine, it's labeled as notification action settings under system. Let's see. Thank you. No, you're not tech support, but this is really helpful. and then at least on mine with my version of Windows you would see all the apps and you'd want to make sure Google Chrome is turned on says it is turned on okay what else could it be then do you do like a focus or no like that notifications are on launch allow app to send important notifications I think what other setting it might be hold on one second here they need to be priority notifications not that I'm aware of let's see what about on your notifications do you have that get notifications from apps and other senders like that's on yes mine doesn't say that I think so I don't think do not stir zone people turn on like a focus thing we're like you know if I'm certain certain hours don't turn on this stuff let me see what else it could be I I can't remember. No Chrome notifications was one of them. I feel like there might be somewhere else too. Let me see. One more time. You're fixing all my problems. This is wonderful. Trying to. Let's see. Let me turn the setup page on. Let's see. Configuration, default company, data fields, notifications. Okay. that page. Let's see. Configuration, default company, data fields, notifications. Okay. Data is working now. Okay. Yeah. It does have to get notifications from apps and other senders. and then you also do the chrome one yeah i think i'd silence the pcr extension notification or something so oh okay i probably had silenced a couple places on accident okay but the other thing yeah the other thing could have been is um the chrome settings for like under privacy and setting like your pop-ups have to be enabled two or three places to check so where can i find notes because when i'm in pcr like regular regular big uh big boy pcr i have edit name resume pipeline activities roll up i can quick oh i just the pin notes up though that's the easiest way okay yeah you can either pin it or depending if you have the security to customize your layout you could customize your layout to show the notes on your front page yeah i was trying i have the security to customize it but i didn't know how to do that customing it okay that makes sense yeah so let me make sure hold on once again i want to be in this database doing it because this is not mine i can't make it on that customer's database so what you want to do is just like open any name record it doesn't really matter who and then in your menu at the top right of that record you're going to click customize yeah so i'm in there and okay when you're in your layout section yeah i just don't know how to get the note okay i can customize this okay yeah so what you're going to want to do is hold on something to get there so i can give you step by step stop fumbling around here okay up at the top left kind of top left you'll see add group yep click that and then switch it to shortcut and then click done I see okay and then what you'll need to do is scroll down to the very bottom you should see this kind of like big banner flint across the bottom yeah I can put in view notes yeah you click yeah click to set fields and don't use private notes. Some people pick that by accident. You want just a view note. Notes or anyone, private notes are just mine. Private notes is a whole separate area. It's not just yours. They're stored completely different that nobody would ever be able to see those other than you. It's not even like a filter. So you would never want to use that. So the private notes, are those searchable in keywords or no? I don't remember if they are because I honestly never have anybody use those okay nobody's ever wanting to just say only show me my notes ever like even an administrator wouldn't be able to see stuff you put there I know that's or something else if you have people that want to steal your leads yeah they're they're not even stored as regular notes where do you recommend putting things so that they're the most searchable if I'm typing in a Boolean string. Is notes a good place to do it? So there's different areas that are keyword searchable. Your resume is, if you're bringing people in from Capture, that profile is your notes, your keywords, and your summary. So the way I usually explain the difference of notes, keywords, summary, summary is like your good, like, overall write-up about the person. Like, if you ever get into presenting them, like that's what you would say about them. where notes are date and timestamp information like what you learn about a person that really doesn't fit in a field yeah and then keywords are just like tagging a record basically yeah i'm using this on the sales side i'm not a recruiter and what's nice about the notes too is that you can like prioritize the notes because You know, let's say over time you've added 15 notes about a person, and it may be a much older one that's more important to see. You can click the star on that note so it shows first, and then it goes by most recent to oldest. Hmm. Okay. Exciting. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Anything else? No, you just saved like probably 40 minutes of my time of workday just by a couple times. So thank you. You are welcome. Thanks.",
