    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Garrett, are you there? Hey, how's it going? Not bad Okay, I think we're waiting on Andrew here Alright He's a Pacific time So he's a little bit earlier than us. Okay. I think that's him there. Good afternoon, Andrew. How are you? Good. How are you? I am well. I have Garrett on the phone as well. He's going to be your trainer here at PC Recruiter. Okay. How's it going? Good, good, good. Very well. Yeah. So I wanted to kind of run through here. So what we are doing today, I'm going to run through or we rather are going to run through a few questions around PC Recruiter. So Garrett's going to have a few questions to ask of you. Since your dimensional search, we know kind of that you need to ring central. We know you need higher easy. We know a lot of the basics, but he has a couple of unique questions for for each user that are a little bit different that he'll run through. I'm going to be primarily your main account manager. If you need to add users down the line, take away users, gesture billing, anything like that, or if you don't know who to go to, come to me and I can help you or get you to someone who can. Garrett's going to be the one to go through the how-tos and the nitty-gritty of the training of the software. So I am going to turn everything over to Garrett to go through these questions, or at the end of that, you'll get a couple of sessions, It's two to three sessions set up as well. So I'll turn everything over to Garrett. That sounds good. Thank you so much, Jim. Nice to meet you, Andrew. Yeah, like you said, just a few questions here. What is the industry you're going to be recruiting in? Is that something you know yet or not yet? Yeah, it's going to be financial and wealth services. That's the industry. the particular verticals will be risk management and legal compliance and quantitative research. Awesome. You said qualitative or quantitative? Quantitative. Quantitative. Okay. Yeah. Excellent. All right. And then are you going to have any additional admin level users on your database starting out here or will it just be you? hopefully at some point soon but for the time being it's just me okay yeah that's good let's see what operating system are you on Windows or Mac I'm my primary computer like the computer that do most of my work is the Windows but I also have Mac phones and tablets and all that stuff okay gotcha All right. And then what browser do you use? Are you in Chrome or Microsoft Edge? Yeah, mostly Chrome. Okay, excellent. Sometimes if it doesn't work, I try some of the other browsers. Gotcha. Yeah, Chrome and Edge are our two preferred browsers, so everything should work. We have browser extensions you can install, so that's designed for Chrome or Edge. Excellent. Who is your email provider? Office 365, Outlook, or Gmail? Office 365. Excellent. Yeah, I went to Dimensional Search. They set everything up for me, but it's Microsoft. Perfect. Okay. And, yeah, since you are with Dimensional Search, we know that they do use Zoom Info, higher easy integrations, RingCentral. Are there any other integrations that you plan to use besides those that you've come across? Not that I know of. So I know, I mean, of course, PC Recruiter is definitely the one. But I think the other ones are probably more optional. So I'm going to try to see. I'm going to sign up for the free trials and see how it goes. Oh, good idea. Okay. Excellent. And I think that's it. Yep. Those are all the questions I have. Let's schedule training. You're in the Pacific time zone, correct? Yes. Yes. Okay. I am in Eastern, so I'm a little bit later. Okay. So I pull up my calendar here. Starting next week, I have some availability. So you'll probably want more of my afternoon slots, I'm imagining then. um okay so um tuesday the 26th it's still kind of early i have 11 30 eastern which is going to be 7 30 yeah 7 30 okay so that one's probably too early uh wednesday thursday friday i have all my afternoons available um so 27th i have a 2 30 eastern or a 3 30 eastern I have that for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday if either of the 2.30 or 3.30 slots work for you So 2.30 will be 11.30 here, right? Yeah And how long are the sessions? Oh, sorry, yeah, each session will be one hour One hour So how about just to be consistent and easy we do 2.30 your time for all Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday okay that sounds good yeah 30 um yeah the dimensional search does like us to pass you over to them for training after the second so we'll do like two together you'll go over to dimensional search then you'll come back for some more training for me so why don't we just schedule the first two uh it might be a good idea to space them out wednesday friday just so you have a day to play around with whatever we talk about. Would that work for you? I mean... Or we could do back-to-back Wednesday, Thursday. Yeah, we could do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. I don't want to load up too many things. Okay, yeah, no, that's fine. Especially the Friday before Labor Day or something like that, right? Yeah, I think that is coming up. You're right. Okay, cool. Yeah, let's do Wednesday the 27th, Thursday the 28th. That's going to be 1130 Pacific time. And I'll send invites for both of those. Okay, good. Awesome. Good. You have my sort of the new correct email address, right? The afsu at wavepressridge.com? Yes, perfect. Okay, good. Got that one. Yeah. Awesome. Okay, yeah, that's everything I needed. Any other questions for us? Either Jim or I? I think for the time, is there anything I need to install beforehand? Oh, sure. There is something called the PCR launcher as well as Java. I can actually just email you right now the two links to get those installed. Okay. Do you have your PCR web address to kind of get to your login screen for your database? I might have, but I haven't gone through all the emails yet. So it could possibly be in one of those emails. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. You'll find the web address there as well as a username and password, kind of like a temporary password to get you in there. So look for that. But, yeah, like I said, I'll send you Java and PCR Launcher, links to download both of those so you can run those installers. Okay. Okay. Great. Awesome. Anything else, Jim, you want to add? No, no, that is all good. Thanks for the time today. We look forward to getting you up and running. Yeah, sounds good. So just a little bit of a heads up. And then so my dimensional training class starts on September 5th. So that's kind of when I need to be a little bit more proficient on things. Good. Yeah. And that'll be great because we do have our first two trainings before then. We'll get you all set up so you have email connected, RingCentral connected, so you'll be good to go for that training. Excellent. Sounds good. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, thanks so much for your time. Sure. And so you will send the invites down, right? Yep, absolutely. Great. Just want to make sure that calendar's booked. Yep. That makes sense. Thanks so much. Thank you. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
