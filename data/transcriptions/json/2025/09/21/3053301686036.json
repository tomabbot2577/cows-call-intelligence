    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yes, sir. I do IT for aviation personnel, and I'm trying to get the PCR portal to work with the new Outlook, Office 365. So it is only available on the classic Outlook. The new Outlook doesn't support the add-ins, which is the PCR portal. Oh, it's the classic Outlook? Yeah, I meant new as in not like 2019 or 2016. Yeah, I definitely got the classic Outlook on there. I just can't get the portal to – it's a fresh install, and I just can't get it to pop off when I open Outlook. Okay. Did you add it as an administrator? It did ask for administrator permission when I went to install it. Gotcha. So you might just have to add it manually. and I can walk you through those steps real quick. Okay, let's do it. So you're going to go to File, inside of Outlook, and then Options. Yep. And that will open that, like, general options box. Yeah, go to Add-ins. Yep. And you're going to go to where it says Manage Com Add-ins. You're going to hit Go. Okay. And then in that box, you're going to hit Add. Yep. and then go to program files x86 yep main sequence technologies yep pc pc recruiter portal all right i'm there and then it's the ax loader eight or the adx loader 64.dll got it and then you'll hit open yep there it is let's see if that works and then close and reopen outlet yep yeah you'll just hit okay and then there it goes man that's perfect i got what i needed yeah so anytime it does you run the portal as an administrator that can happen or like if it asks for that administrator right password you just got to go in and do the manual entry see i was doing it manually but i didn't know which flipping dll to choose uh yep it's that uh yeah adx loader 64 thanks man i appreciate it yep not a problem you have a good one you too bye",
