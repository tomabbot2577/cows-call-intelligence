    "text": " Hello? Hello, Sabine? Yes. Yes, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. I just got your inquiry a little while ago through our website. Thought I'd give you a quick call. Just kind of touch base, see how I can help. Oh, sounds good, Jim. This isn't a great time for me, so maybe we could schedule a time to chat. I'd like to learn more, you know, certainly about the product. We're in the market for a CRM. Sure, I'd love to get a demo scheduled with you. We're closed the next two days. Another reason I reached out just to get something on the schedule. Do you have any time early next week? Might work? Yeah, let's see here. I think Monday, no, but Tuesday or Wednesday I should have some availability. Let's take Wednesday because my Tuesday is pretty full. My Wednesday is wide open, though. Okay, perfect. I could do like 10 or 11 in the morning Eastern if that would work. I'm going to open my calendar real quick. Let me do that. Bear with me. It's a little slow. Oh, for sure. No problem. I just shut my computer, so I should have popped back up. What time zone are you in? I'm in Eastern. Okay, me too. Yeah, I'm in Florida. Yeah, I'm in Ohio just getting a little caught up today and was working along here and not paying attention to the time. Oh, no problem. And I know I just didn't put that request in too long ago, so I appreciate you getting back to me so quickly. Let me just see if I can open it up on my phone. Oh, I know what it's doing. It's going to the top screen. Hold on a second. Multiple screens. Do you work from home? I do. I do. Yeah. I like it. It works well. Me too. We're fortunate. All right. Tuesday or Wednesday. Okay, so that's the 9th. And, yeah, so on Tuesday, it looks like I currently have availability at 9 a.m. or in the afternoon. What's better for you? What about Wednesday? Could Wednesday work? Oh, Wednesday. That's what I meant to say. Wednesday. My two-fifth fall. Oh, Wednesday. I could probably do like a 1 p.m. Would that work? Or 2 p.m.? Let's see. Yep. One is great. One is great. Yeah. And do you have my email? You want to just send me a Teams invite? Is that what it would be? Actually, could we do two? That would be a little better. 2 p.m. Eastern? Yep. Two is fine as well. I've got your email from the inquiry. I will send you over Zoom. with an invite as well. All right. Well, thank you. Enjoy the long weekend. You as well. You take care. We'll talk again. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye now.",
