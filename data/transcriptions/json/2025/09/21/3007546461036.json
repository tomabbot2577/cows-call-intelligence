    "text": " Yo, yo. Hey, what's up? Hey, so they're looking for... They're trying to find everybody that hasn't had a specific activity written in the past six months. Yeah. I'm not sure which activity. I was just seeing if it was possible to do anything related to last activity in general, but I don't know. Okay, yeah. So... So I believe – let me send this over to you and see if this works for you. Okay. So obviously, when I send this, you'll have to change the days and the activity type. Oh, okay. Got it. Bulk email. Okay. Entry date. Oh, okay. Very nice. Yeah, I will try that. and I'll ask them what the specific activity is they're looking for. That would be great. That doesn't work right now, so don't lose it. There we go. All right. So I would put this in the – can I put it in the generated advanced search area? You should be able to. Let me test it real quick. Okay. So on mine, it's 34. for my PCR query, if I put it in generated query. Or sorry, advanced search custom query. Yeah. Maybe that works differently. It didn't look like it was working. Yeah, looks like it just blanks out. Yeah. Okay, it might just be useful for the custom stats. That's fine. Which, hey, if it works for the custom stat form, that's good enough. They can roll them up from there. Yeah, that's even better because it's always updating each time you log in and stuff, so that's probably preferred anyway. Awesome. Great find. I'm pretty sure I've done that before. Nice. Let me know if that ends up working for you. Cool. I'll save it on my test database so I have that available in the future. That'll be great. What I always do is before I tell the customer it's working, put it in as my PCR query because it might generate results, but you always want to spot check it. Okay. Like some of the names that come up. Let me just make sure real quick, too. Did you add it as a query already for yours? Yeah, my test database, I have it there. And it worked? Yeah, it worked on custom staff. Looks good. Okay, perfect. Because that was like half of a different query. because the full query was finding everybody that had no activity in a certain amount of time but excluded bulk email. Oh, okay. So, like, if bulk email was their only activity. Gotcha. Yeah. So, yeah, this is... So, if the candidate or activity type is bulk email and entry date is... Okay, so this would show anybody who got... Wait. Oh, hold on. Yeah, I think I might have confused myself, too. Anybody who had not received bulk email for more than six months, maybe, is one way we could reword it. No, hold on. Maybe it's just a less than. less than X number of days oh yeah where you can change the get to a yeah let me try that real quick What, L-E? Instead of G? Yeah. Okay, I never heard of that one. That's sweet. Okay, let's try that. I think that's it. Refresh that. Yeah, I think that works. Let me send you the updated one. Okay, cool. It's so hard to tell because I was gone for three months. Nothing. Yeah, it's probably a lot to try to reignite in your brain. Well, it's not even that. It's just these activities are old, so I can't tell how I do math. Okay, let's try this one. Yeah, we'll do a 180 day. That's a good idea. Okay, pop that in there. Save. And refresh. Okay, so that gives me 12 results. This should be anyone who hasn't got a bulk email in the last 180 days. So those Darren activities. This is the last bulk email. Oh, wait. I think I messed that up too. Yeah, 627. Yeah, okay. I'm not good at this so I'm going to try something that's going to be wrong but let me just try. Oh, I'm an idiot. What? So this one is find all names where there is an activity or a specific activity type. Or, yeah, find all names where there's an activity. Yeah, where a specific activity type was written. But we could just do candidate ID not in. Oh, okay. Candidate not in. Select candidate from. Try that. And it would be the GE still. Okay. Pretty sure. Okay, that gets more results. And then if I go to them and I say activities, they did not get a bulk email 180 days the first guy went to. That's great. This person. I think that one's working. I know somebody got an email 12 days ago, so I'm going to try it with 12 days and see if they show up. Yep, that's the one. Bingo. Good work. Good old not coming through clutch. Excellent. Cool. All right, yeah. I'll just do it once in the customer's database too to make sure it's all coming up right and then I'll send it over. Awesome. sweet well glad that worked out just yeah i just need to talk through it a little bit yep very cool all righty we'll have a great rest of your day you too man talk to you later bye",
