    "text": " Hello? Yes, this is Robin. Thank you for calling me. Okay. Sorry, you broke up a little bit. Hi. I started to go with Red Tide, and I have, I guess, to download something so I can open an attachment. We have an accompanying profile. Deanna said just to give you guys a call for help. Okay, yeah, there's a couple apps that you have to install. It just kind of depends on your operating system. And I can send you those links over. Let's see. Bear with me one second here. Hold on. I've got too many windows open. Okay. what is your name Amy Nelson okay let me add it to red kite And what is your email address? Amy, A-M-Y, at redtightrecruiting.com. Okay. I'm giving you the links that you'll need. So for PCR to work correctly on your computer, you said your Windows, right? Yes. Okay. So you have to add Java and what's called the PC Recruiter Launcher because the launcher was actually opening our add resume screen, alarms, and also allowing it to open attachments. And then it also needs Java. I just sent you an email. Let me know when you get that. Okay. And if you're in PC Recruiter now, you might as well go ahead and log out. Okay. Because you'll need to log back in anyway afterwards. Okay. Okay, so let me know when you're out of there. And then back to my email. Okay. I'm out and back to email. Okay. All right. So there's going to be two apps that we have to install. They're listed under where it says Windows. The first one is Java. So go ahead and download that file. And then once it's done downloading, you're going to open and run that file. It's asking, like, for do you want this. Does it have to make changes to your device? You need to hit yes. I can usually hear that ding. Out of date Java version detected. Okay. So uninstalled. So, yeah, that means you probably already had Java. So is it at the end where it already tried to install and that was like at the very end? Yeah. Okay. So go ahead and uninstall. Yeah. That way you only have one version. Because basically what it's saying is you're replacing with a new version. Do you want to get rid of the old one? Okay. I've successfully installed. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So then you're going to go back to the email I sent you. And you're going to go to the second link under Windows where it says PC Recruiter Launcher for Windows. Okay. All right. Set up wizard. Yeah, you'll basically just go like, I accept. Next. I, you know, kind of. Two setup types, typical or custom? Typical. In my 19 years here, I've never had to use custom. I'm not really sure why that's an option. It's always typical. Just in case. Okay, so my computer stopped doing things, so. Okay. I think I'm good. Okay, so once that's done, so it went through the process. Sometimes it's kind of slow in the beginning, then kicks in and runs. It all looks good? The window, like, it swirled and the window closed out. Okay, you probably ran pretty fast then. Okay, so what I'm going to have you do now is go to your PCR login page and log in. But the first time you log in, you're going to see some extra prompts that I'm going to talk you through. Okay. Okay. So once you hit log in, the first one's going to be your browser asking if you want to open the PCR control loader. There's a little checkbox. Hit that checkbox. Oh, okay. It's not logging in. My password is not working, which is weird. Hmm. I'm sure caps lock is off too. Yeah, okay. Open control loader. Okay, so before you click that, there's a checkbox. Hit the checkbox. That way you're telling your browser it's okay to run this when I go to the site. Otherwise, I get that option all the time and it gets annoying. Okay. And then after you do that, it's going to tell you about checking for an update. New version is required. Yes. Click Allow. Okay. And then that should do it. You should now be able to open attachments. and if you went to like a company record and were using ad resume, that would work as well. Let's try that. I was looking for someone's pay agreement earlier. And I'm like, I say action, I see open, it's doing nothing. Let's see what this is. CC Recruiter Loader is not running. Oh, and you checked that box and then said open, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's have you log in one more time. Okay. That's that launcher tool that it's looking for. again okay I'm back in again all right let's try this again I already said. Yeah. Something's not right. So. You have RingCentral, right? Yes. Yes. It says PC Recruiter Loader is not running. And I hit OK, and it says PC Recruiter Loader is not running. It just said the same thing twice. Oh, that's really weird. Okay, so let's do a screenshot. You have RingCentral. If you open up RingCentral, go to Video and select Join. And let me know when you're ready for a meeting ID. Okay, I'm ready. Okay, it's going to be 050-394-810. Now, once you get in, it's going to ask you about joining with computer audio. You're going to want to not join with audio since we're already on the phone. Got it. Okay. All right. Join without audio. Okay. And then at the bottom of your screen where it says share, select that. All right. And then go to, then go to, go over to entire screen. I don't know where it says entire screen. I had just shared my screen. Let me do it again. It just says screen one or screen two. Oh, there. Okay. I'm sharing. I'm going to ask for remote control if that's okay. Go for it. That's really odd. Oh, I wonder if... Hmm. Can I... Can I try restarting this? I wonder if this has anything to do with it. Because it's wanting to run an update. Just in case. okay Okay, one other thing I want to try here. Let me see. I always forget. Remove. Nope. That's probably where I should have gone. Is this opening on your other screen? Yep. Do you need to see it? Yeah. Can you drag it over? Yep. Okay. Okay. Done. Okay. Good. One and only one. one that means we did get rid of the other one sometimes what happens is uh if it doesn't install the old one you have two and then it gets confused or something okay and we've got piece recruiter launcher okay so that's good um i'm gonna try one thing here i'm just clearing cached images and files nothing else did they happen to give you like somebody else's computer yeah somebody else had this and it was sitting in a closet for a year or two and then Deanna dug it out and got it okay yeah that could be why maybe there's some like old stuff being remembered so I'm just going to clear that cache images and files and now let's try going in here because it should recognize it so let's see can you go and put your password in Okay. Okay. And where were you on, the name record? Company. Was it this one here? Yeah, just pick a company. It doesn't matter. Okay. So, like, I was looking for their priority search right there. Yep. All right. That's cool. Not opening up on another screen? Nope. It says, TC recruiter loader is not running. Oh, okay. Not opening up on another screen? Nope. It says TC Recruiter Loader is not running. Okay. It didn't pop up. And then it says Java 32 bit not found. Okay. Oh, Task Manager, is that going to your other screen as well? Yep, you need to see that. Okay, yeah, if you can drag that over. I wonder if something's hung up in the background processes. We did the install. Oh, it doesn't let me scroll. Can I have you scroll to where just after, like under background processes, let's look for Java TMSE platform binary or something like that. It's going to be listed as. No, okay. No Java. It seems to be alphabetical, yeah. Okay. Let's exit here. I'm going to try something, kind of force it, see if we get anything there. Java 32-bit not found. Okay. Let's run that Java one again. I was going to say, it's like it didn't load. Yeah. Let's go. I think we were here, right? I'm just going to redo these from scratch. Just in case. Never know. All right. This says, do I want to allow this app to make changes to my vice? Yes. Hit yes there. Okay, it loaded. Also, actually, I'm not going to uninstall Portal, but while we're here, I'm going to at least update it for you. Okay, allow to make changes. yep okay all right let's try this all over again let's see what happens and then I'm also going to update your portal because it looks like that's out of date too okay so first one will go to Java Now some of the stuff I won't be able to see. We're going to go to your other screen. Yep. Yep. Hit yes. Now it says updated license. Can you drag that over? Because it did say, you know, when you try to do launch or how it was kind of like really quick. So I'm just going to redo these. Let's see if something just got interrupted in the process. Let's hit install. Okay, I've successfully installed Java. Okay, perfect. All right. Then we're going to go to, where do you have your bookmark for PC Recruiter? Do you have it under Recruiting Tools? Oh, I don't know. I'll just. Oh, I see here. Okay. There you go. You got right there. Okay. We're going to do this one again. I'm a tab person. Oh, sign in. Hold on one second. I'm going to redo this one again. No, hold on. Downloading. run this one. Can you drag this screen over so I can see it on top of your login your PCR screen? Can you see that? No, can you drag the install for the launcher over? Just drag it on top of Peace Recruiter. I did, but my screens have just like the backdrops, like everything else is gone. so I can hit yes yes that's one screen I can't see now I have this okay perfect now I can see it that one screen that says does it have to make changes to your device it never shows me that one okay hit next I accept the terms and then next typical and then install now did you see that before I mean it was kind of quick though okay let's hit finish okay put in your password now Couldn't hit okay on that alert. Oh, for Kate? Yeah. Now I'm a little concerned because I'm not seeing what I would expect to see about, like, the allow stuff. So let me try this first. Name. Is this opening up any kind of window? Nothing you can't see. Not even on your other screen, right? No. It opens right on top. What is going on here? I don't usually have an issue, especially with the windows. Macs I fumble around, but this one not usually. Can you... Let's see, I'm trying to... Can you not move the mouse around for a moment? Yep. Okay. Oh, they don't have that as an option. Okay. Let's see, do I have anything? Thank you. that right all right the resume that I opened are you seeing that yep Got it. Yep. Okay. Let's try this one. Okay. Yep. All right. That seemed to work. I think you're good there. The other thing I wanted to download for you though, because here's this out of date. Do you use Outlook? Yeah. Okay. Let me just see your Outlook here. Can you slide that over for me? Mm-hmm. Okay. So this looks like it's the web version of Outlook. We do have an add-in. So I had to open it that way, unless you can help me fix this, that would be great. I had to open it that way because that was the only way I could see the Amy at Red Kite Recruiting and the HR box. If I look in the other way, it doesn't show the HR email box. Okay. Yeah, because right now this looks like their new Outlook. I don't see the classic version of Outlook installed on your computer. I just see the Outlook app. so to use our PC Recruiter portal add-in you would actually have to install that version that classic one this newer one they don't support com add-ins which is what it doesn't say Outlook new well here it is apps Outlook classic that's That's the one we want. So if you use the Outlook Classic, which we could pin down here, I believe. Let's see what happens here. Okay, sign in or create an account. It says I don't have a Microsoft 365 license. Okay, so that you'll have to work out with, I guess, Deanna. Yeah. Yeah. Like, who hosts your email? I thought you guys were Office 365. Well, I mean, like I said, this is all – I'm on week two here, so it may not be tough, right? I don't know. Right. Okay, so the version that you have is out of date, but you'd have to use that classic version of Outlook for the Outlook portal. But we do have your Java and Launcher working. Do you know if she – let's just double check. Let's say she did do an email setup for you, because I know you guys use sequencing and analytics. Yeah. Okay, she didn't do any of that. Okay. Let me see what they have for email alias list, if anything. This is wrong. God, I have a delay when it's Office 365. Test. Okay, so it is in Office 365. Let's go to mail servers. Oh, why were they not in here? Interesting. Oh, because they set it up wrong. Okay, we're going to delete this out. They set up a pop which is like really old technology. So we're just like downloading emails off the server and not keeping things in sync. So we want to redo this as IMAP. Okay, sign in. Okay, that's all correct right there, right? It looks like you're already signed in technically. Okay, test. That password is not real, I'm assuming. It's huge. Right. So Microsoft requires you to do like a sign-in method to connect, and then they generate this like super long, secure password that nobody would be guessing. Okay, so then we have to do this. Okay, so we have to tell it what is the name of your sent folder, what is the name of your trash folder because as it keeps things in sync it needs to know where things go When you send an email, this is fine, but I did add, oops, I need one more zero there. I did have a delay, so it spaces them out a little bit, but we want those emails going to that mail server. Let's double check this. Okay, perfect. okay so now if you were in pcr you could come up here and go to email now the emails themselves they take a while to actually sync but at least we have your folders from now. So then I don't see myself using an email that way. You won't have to use it, but what it does is let's say if you're emailing with candidates and things like that, it'll write the activity for you. Okay. But also because you have sequencing and analytics, if you were ever doing like a sequence or an email, we have to have PCR mail set up. to say that this is a reply for this sequence or this campaign. Okay. Okay. So that will take a little bit, but certainly by Monday, you know, when you come back to work, it will be in there. So you should be good. But I can still use my email the way I would use yours? Oh, yeah, absolutely. The things that you have in your email, what it will do for you, let's say if you go to me as an example. If you were to send an email to this email address, or if I were to email you from this email address, it'll automatically write an activity. So I'm sure somebody in here has an activity. There we go. Let's see how email received. You can see Lisa and I have emailed back and forth with each other. Got it. But we need to read that for this to work. and then the other thing that it'll do now you won't you'll see like for example lisa's activities with me there is also an emails tab it's just not pinned oh actually it is in there somewhere um but what it will do is if you have an email to or from me it'll list them here and clicking the subject line takes you into the email but those aren't shared it's actually just looking at your own PCR mail because when you click on the subject line it'll actually have like reply forward delete options and you would not want somebody having that much access to your email so others will be able to see it as activity but you would actually be able to jump to the email right from here rather than having to go to your outlook or even going to pcr mail and then having to do a search for the email you can just jump to it right from the record so it's really nice someone says oh i emailed you last week and you don't feel like digging for the email as long as you don't permanently delete it you'd be able to get to it um from pcr as well got it so you should be pretty set there then awesome all right um so this other i'll contact the stamp for gross people about the microsoft 365 um um do i do i it should say that you well what's nice about this if you wanted to think your calendar, if you had a resume in your email, it could open it up. Can you show me what your, can you slide up? Because you do have an Office 365 account. Can you drag it over? Can you drag it, because I mean, you have an email account at least. Because that's what you just authenticated as. That's what it says. I know that I'm going to sign in this. Amy asked me to sign in. Yeah, that you probably got to run by them because you did sign in, it looks like. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would ask them about that. Maybe they didn't give you a license for Outlook apps or, I'm sorry, Office 365 apps. that could be what it is. Okay. I will ask. You at least have an email account with them. Okay. All righty. I'll ask there next. Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome. Have a great weekend. Thanks, you too. All righty. Bye. Bye.",
