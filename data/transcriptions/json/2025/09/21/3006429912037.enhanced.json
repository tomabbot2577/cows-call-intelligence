    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and close the session. Jim, how are you doing? I am well, Colin. How are you? I'm doing all right. Sorry for the delay there. You should be more on time. Oh, no problem. Jason actually just chatted me and said he's just getting off another training, running a little bit over. So he's going to join us in just a couple of minutes here. No problem. So what we're going to do today, yeah, we will, he has a series of questions that he'll want to go over with you to discuss how you're going to use the system, what specific integrations you're looking for, anything like that. Like since you're dimensional search, we know that you're going to want to set up RingCentral. We know you're going to want to set up HireEZ. And then he has some questions, just kind of the basics of like, oh, what do you use, PC or Mac? What do you use for email? Just a series of questions to kind of gain a little insight into what you're using now, how you work, etc. So he'll run through those questions there. So he's going to be the one to give you all the trainings, all your training and everything. I'm going to be the one, if you ever need to add users, email me. If you need to drop users down the line, any contract-related items and stuff, that comes right to me. Or if there is ever anything you don't know who to go to, find me, and I can either help you or get you to someone who can. Okay. That does lead me to immediately a couple questions. Sure. So I do intend on getting a SDR here very soon. And then I contact you and then we do the same thing? Yeah. Well, anytime you add a user, just pop me an email and let me know, and I can put a ticket in for my accounting team to increase your user count. And then no additional training comes with the new user unless you have some hours left. In that case, you can go ahead and schedule an hour with them or anything like that. we also have a learning management system some nice online help as well so we do have some other resources should you need to do that okay that's all I got thank you so much certainly certainly and then also the training so I think you're in the August 4th class are you I'm not I'm in the July 7th class oh okay that's today Jason will get something scheduled as soon as possible, maybe even as early as tomorrow. I don't know what his schedule looks like, but he always tries to get something scheduled ASAP. If you meet anyone else, most of your colleagues might have had a couple training sessions already, but not the end of the world. He'll get you strained up as quickly as he can, and we will go ahead and get a couple sessions under our belt. And then what will happen, Dimensional Search also has kind of a process that they go through, a scheduling training process. They will go ahead and train you a little bit, and then they'll pass you back to us. So you essentially have two teams training you on the setup use of PC Recruiter as well as recruiting. So you have a couple of different people helping you out there. So I think, Jason, you just joined us? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Sorry for being a little late. No problem. Not a problem at all. Yeah, so I was just kind of talking with Colin about the basic setup, how we'll get everything set up. He is in the dimensional search training class that starts today, I think. So as quick as possible, we'll want to get him scheduled because we just got him in. So we'll go ahead and get that scheduled. I'll just turn things over to you to run through the few questions you have. I'll explain kind of how everything goes and that you have a few questions prior to getting something on the schedule with him. Perfect. Um, well, uh, hi Colin. Nice to meet you. I'm Jason. I'm going to be your trainer. Um, so the questions I have are going to be kind of help, uh, help me shape and guide the process of training and getting you up to speed with PC recruiter. Um, the first one I have is what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing? Like a full-time, uh, permanent placement contract? Like, what are you thinking? I'm thinking permanent placement. Okay, cool. Awesome. Um, if you ever decide to, uh, take a dip in the contracting stuff. Just let me know. There's contracting features inside of PCR and we can cover those if it ever becomes relevant. Is there a specific type of industry or niche that you're going to be focused in? Yes. We're putting systems engineers in the avionics industry and data scientists. Cool. Okay. Have you worked as a recruiter before? I have not. Okay. Awesome. Within the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? Yes. Okay. Once you reach that point, I imagine Jim had already said this, but just let Jim know, and he'll help you get all that contract stuff straightened out. Perfect. Okay. Just a few I have to answer. Have you ever used a CRM or an ETS before? Not like these. Okay, cool. And then this next one is going to relate to training speed. I know with the dimensional search class starting today, we want to make sure we knock out a few pretty quickly this week. But in just kind of the traditional how you would like this to go, we have a fast, moderate, and slow pace that we can go at. That would be three trainings a week, two trainings a week, or one training a week. They would each be one hour long, and you have a total of 10 hours. So what are you thinking for how fast you would like to go? Three hours a week. Okay, cool. What kind of operating system are you using, like Windows or Mac? Mac. Okay. And what browser are you using? Google Chrome. Perfect. And who is your email provider? It is Microsoft Outlook. Perfect. A few more I got to answer. Okay. So usually at this point with dimensional search clients, there's an intention of having a website. It's just not completed yet. Is that where you are? Yes, that's correct. Cool. And then just so I have an understanding of what beats to hit inside of PCR, there's a wide variety of automation that can be done inside of PCR. How do you feel about automation versus like a more manual hands-on approach? I prefer automation to its fullest extent. Okay, cool. So that's all the questions I have. The next thing we want to make sure we get done is get some scheduling on the books. um so i know we want to make sure we get a running start on this because with dimensional search starting today we want to usually with the dimensional search classes they just kind of want to have like a baseline understanding for that first one um so being that that was today i think maybe we should uh try and hammer in at least two for tomorrow and wednesday um if that would work for you. The first one is going to be fairly administrative. It's just some user setup, connecting your email, connecting RingCentral, things like that. So just anticipate that first one being administrative. But by the second one, we're going to start talking actual course material. Being that we want to do three a week, maybe we can just get three on for this week. usually how I like to schedule these is I like to choose specific days of the week at specific times and just say these are the dates and times that we're meeting. How would Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday at 11 a.m. Eastern, how would that work for you? How long are these? 11 a.m. Eastern? Yeah. Run into that the FFG training for me, so it does not work. Okay. Would earlier be better? later is actually preferable do you have anything what about 4 p.m. Tuesday Wednesday Friday perfect Tuesday Wednesday Friday 4 p.m. Eastern could not be a better time perfect let me just get this down really quick while I get this entered any questions for me how long are these trains there an hour each yeah they're an hour each and you have 10 hours being that we're going three trainings a week you'll probably get done in like two and a half weeks sounds like a plan i'm game for it awesome um so with that if you ever need to reschedule anything move anything around i'm fairly flexible so just let me know and we can reschedule them that works perfectly for me cool um gm do you have any questions no no i am all good i'm all good thank you for the time today both of you Glad we could get connected and get things started. Okay. Awesome. Then I will send out those meeting invites for Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and I will see you tomorrow, Colin. Perfect. I look forward to it. You all have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
