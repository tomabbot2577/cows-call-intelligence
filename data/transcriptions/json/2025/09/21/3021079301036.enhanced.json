    "text": " Hey, Russ, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm doing good, Joe. I was thinking about you. Thanks for getting back to me before the weekend. No problem. No problem. Got your voicemail. Wanted to let you know I'm going to put in a ticket to take that user off your billing, and then someone from my accounting team is going to be in touch as to how they do credits for the prorated of the rest of the prepaid year. They'll take care of that. They'll be in touch. And if you deleted the user out of your database, or even if you just marked it disabled, that will work. If they're not able to log in anymore, you should be good. Yeah, that's what I did. I disabled the account, so he shouldn't be able to come in, which is fine, but I just wanted to make sure that he doesn't have access and I'm still not getting charged. Yeah, I'll put the ticket in today, so they'll put it as of today, and they'll work on the credit, and then he's not able to access it anymore, so you should be good. All right, man, I appreciate it. Thanks very much for your follow-up, Joe. My pleasure. All right, take care. All right, have a good weekend. All right, bye. You too, sir. Bye now.",
