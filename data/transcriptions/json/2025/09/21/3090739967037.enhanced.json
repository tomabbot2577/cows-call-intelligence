    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, this is Garrett. I've got Todd Eikenberry with Elite Recruiters wanting to change his credit card information. Oh, okay. Alrighty. I'll send him your way. All right. Bye. Hello, this is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Todd Eikenberry. How are you? I'm good. How are you? So refresh my memory. How do you spell your last name? Yeah, it's E-I-K. E-I-K. E-I-K-E-N-Berry. Okay. I couldn't remember if it was E-I-C-H or – okay, gotcha. Yeah. Elite recruiters. Okay. I need to find my – you know what, Todd? Getting old sucks. I know. I'm like, if I don't zoom in on my screen, I'm like, oh, these eyes. Sometimes they're not too good. Other times they're fine. Okay, so right now it looks like there's a visa stored which ends in 0461. Right. You want to take that one off? Yeah, I just need you to help me with that. Is that the deal? I could do it online or I can do it with you. You could do it online or you could do it with me. Do you want to just have me do it? How do I do it really quickly? Okay. Do you have the customer portal link? No. If this is involved, I can just do it with you, right? I just got this card. Okay. Why don't I do it for you, and then what I'll do in the meantime is I'll also send you a link to the customer portal. So I'll go ahead and send that. Okay. That's fine. And then that way you can take your time. What you would have to do in this link that I just sent you, you would first need to create a billing account. If you haven't done that yet, it doesn't use any PCR credentials. So you would put in your EIK or was it EIK or ELK? That's okay. You can just help me change the card. Let's change it real quick. Yeah. But if you ever want to do that, you can always go in. Okay. So let me turn the auto pay off for a moment. and then I'll take out the card that we have. Okay. And I'll add a new card. Okay. So the name on the card, is that your full name or is it something else? It is. Okay. My full name. And then your card number? It's 4246-3154. Okay. Okay. The expiration month and year? 10-27. Okay. And the security number on the back? 162. And is this card also 11281 Mirador Lane, Fishers, Indiana 46038? Yeah, I think it's actually 37 now, but it's fine. Yeah, what is the zip code associated with the card? Otherwise, it could get rejected. I think it's 46037. Okay. Okay. But still, Fisher's, Indiana, and 11281, Mary Door Lane. Okay. If the zip code is incorrect, it might fail the next time it tries to process. But we'll let you know if that happens. I think that's right. It's 37. Okay. All right. So we'll do it. We'll turn that, and we'll turn the auto pay back on. And right now you do not have any open invoices. So your next one is scheduled for, let's see. Your next one is scheduled for September, I'm sorry, October 10th. So if there is any issue with either that zip code or anything else, we'll just, you know, reach out to you then. Okay. All right. You're all set then. Hey. Yeah. Real quick question. I don't, like, think I'm going to cancel, but I don't know. I'm trying to decide, like, it seems like PC recruiters fall behind on a lot of the say I stuff. I know there was like a new app that you guys had. I'm just a single operator. I mean, am I in what I should be in? Is this other app that you guys were working on, that updated one, is that better? Or do you have any thoughts? The goal with the new PCRM is just like a redesign as well as trying to keep things simpler where you don't have like 20 ways to do one thing. you are welcome to take advantage of that one i could put you on a list to be reached out if you wanted to do that as far as the ai we do have the ai searching available in both both versions ai candidate match is currently in that version called pcrm but it is coming out for pcr9 which is when you probably have i believe next week and what that says is if you're on a job you basically click a button based on words in the job description versus what's on the resume, it'll show you the top 20 matches. Okay. I mean, I'm not like, I'm not like, you know, horribly unhappy with it or anything. I just, I'm just trying to figure out if there's other things that are more current, but I don't know. I don't know. Is this, what do you feel like this PCRN or whatever, is the functionality, is it really stripped down or is the functionality as good, but just simpler? It's simpler and it's just different. So instead of things where like it's like top and bottom, you would have more like, let's say your search results kind of like at the, like behind it. And when it pops up, it's more at the right in a pop-up. Okay. So like layouts are different, things like that. I could have somebody reach out to give you a demo on that if you're interested. Let me also see what else you have on your thing too. Here, hold on one second. Yeah, and also, I mean, you don't even have some of the other features. Like we have like mail campaigns, analytics, sequencing. Those are some other features that are also now available, even just in PCR 9. Looks like I could have Jim Lombardo, who is our account manager, reach out to you. Is the cost on this the same? I don't know if it would be much more. He would be able to answer that. There would probably be some increase to that. not for really for um but then you could take advantage of all those features is there a online demo where i can just look at this pcrn where you could just send me a link to it or something i don't know if we have it i'll find out on that i don't know if there is a link on that. Okay. I will find out. Sound good? Yep, that sounds good. We have that person contact me, and if there is a link, send me the link, and I'll just go look at it. Absolutely. Thanks so much. Oh, no problem. I'm going to look and see if there is a link, because I don't know if there is. Okay. All right. I will look for one. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Bye.",
