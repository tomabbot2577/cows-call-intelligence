    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. I missed a part of what you were saying. Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey Robin, my name is Connie Rose and I'm employed. They have me in your system with Connective Services. And I have a question to ask on the software. So I'm trying to accomplish something. It's been way too long and I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, what's going on? On, in PCR, I played the videos that we have and I entered a candidate, right? I'm just going to take the one last one, Letitia Logan. So I remember when I played the videos with Tito that he talked about being able to add the resume and then in the beginning and parse in a lot of information. Now I'm having to go line by line by line by line. Oh, okay. Yeah, well, to create, okay, so parsing resume, it will only do it in certain fields, and it just depends where you are starting from. Are you just wanting to put them into your default company, or do you have the company maybe that they work for and you want to add them to that company? Well, I'm adding them to the company that they are currently, currently that I know they are currently working for. Okay, so if you start from the company there's a couple ways to get there and I'll just kind of depends what's the best way. I'm just going to open them up because I've already got the company loaded in. Okay, so if you're looking at the company record probably at the top right where you have your save option, you should have an option called add name, which is like data entry, but then there's another option called add resume. I did see that and I opened that up okay then it populates another screen right yeah yeah pops up another window and then what you would do down like if you do you have the resume sitting on your desktop oh yeah I have it run from so I think okay so if you have the resume sitting on your desktop if you go to open you would then browse your computer to that file okay that's what I mean because there's open, clear, paste, and, you know, open and paste and close are the ones that are active. The other ones are grayed out, right? So that just takes me right into my document. Okay. So what I would find, yeah, it's a simple thing, but when you're learning a bunch of software at the same time. Oh, I got it. Yeah, and you'll see that ad name and ad resume in many places. In that recently viewed card, if you open up the company at the right, like where you have the save, and then if you were to open up the company and click names, you even have it there too, except that's going to be plus and then there. So there's quite a few ways to get there. It's just kind of like, you know, how far up or how far into the company record you are. The other place where you can get there too, just so you know, over at the very top right of Peace Recruiter, there's that quick add. I don't see that. It's like the lightning bolt with the plus sign. It'd be up at the top right where your user image is. I see that. Okay. If you say quick add and then say name and go to parse from resume, when you hit start, it'll pop up that same screen. Start. A window should have popped up to parse your, oh, okay. Yeah. So that's just another way to get there if you're you know yeah it just depends now that way if you don't pick a company though it goes into your the person goes to your default otherwise you have to use that picker to the right of the company name field so it kind of depends what company do you want them in so if you really want them in the company it's better to probably start from the company that's easier to see exactly which company record you're picking because you're looking at all the details about that company right yeah that's a very good thing because I could end up with a bunch of stuff in default and then I'm trying to find things and I can't find yeah or if you have a lot of companies with the same name like different locations it's just easier to oh yeah first and then do it from there that's what I'm going to do I mean they drilled into me this is my third week I'm halfway through my third week and so um yeah and I knew I even told them in the meeting I said you know it's got to be a better way this is too slow you know and I said I know that guy told me I could parse it I'm gonna go in there play that video again but I had like six weeks of videos that I crammed down my throat in like I don't know six days and I watched them and watched them and I went back and watched them again and then the minute I was trying to um get to that part in the video where he was talking about that I had to go to a meeting and then I had to go talk to IT and here I am at 2.15 p.m. Eastern Standard Time trying to get something in the system. So my production board is a little like I'm lame, you know. No, it doesn't pull everything. You might have other fields and stuff you'd like to have. Those you could still populate once the record's created, but at least what it tries to do, and it's always good, you know, double check it. Did it pull the name correctly? How you want the job title? because you can always edit before you save when you're in that review screen once it pops up. The other thing, too, just so you know, sometimes you don't have the document, like, sitting on your desktop or you don't want to browse to it. In that white space where the resume, you know, you end up sawing it show, if you were to actually drag a resume file onto that white space down at the bottom of the Add Resume screen, it'll recognize the file and then parse it that way if you didn't want to hit open and then browse to it oh that's a cool option yeah sometimes like if you have like especially if you have more than one monitor you might have the resume file and you just pop up screen drag it to the bottom of it add resume screen and it'll process it that way yeah yes ma'am oh that's great that's great information I'm gonna share that next tomorrow morning on the team meeting so that I think a lot of people know because when I talk about open opening a parsing window, they just look at me and blink. Oh, I should have heard about that. But it's really time-consuming, and I am bringing in a lot of niches to the insurance piece that nobody's ever worked. Like, I'm on my own little island. Kevin said he named my thing Connie's World, you know, because everybody's financed pretty much. I mean, there is an insurance piece in here, but it's like 2% of the finance world, right? Okay, so here's one more trick. you might like a little bit more too. Let's say you had a folder, and I wouldn't put too many in there, but maybe you have like five or 10. I don't want to keep going open, process it, save. Open, process, save. You would put like maybe five to 10 resumes in a folder, drag that folder to that bottom of the add resume screen, and what it'll do is it'll show you the first file for you to review. You hit save, and it'll immediately show you the next file in that folder. So I'd be safe with about five? Yeah, I would do five or ten. I mean, I just wouldn't want you to do 100 because at some point you're going to, you know, need to go get coffee or go to lunch or go into a meeting and you're not going to be done with it. So if you put like a manageable group, like I have time to do all of these right now, you could do one. It shows it and then it just goes to the next one. So I could literally take a few. I have for a brief minute. I have paper copy resumes on my desk. Right. I just feel safe with that. and then I put a mark through it. That way I know that I'm going to have to upload those to my offshore person and make certain that I did it right. So far I'm getting, like, you know, a perfect score. I haven't screwed up the data, I don't think. So that would be beneficial, definitely, bringing five or ten in at a time. Yeah, sometimes that's super, like, just helpful. We don't even have to go in open, browse through it again. For years. I mean, I own my own staffing agency for 23 years. I'm bringing all that book in. So right now we're in a headlock with IT, my IT firm, trying to get it in CSV or CVS files. It's a mess. I don't want to go there. But it'll get done eventually. But you're very helpful. I appreciate you guys at TCR. You always pick up real fast and you solve the problem. You answer the question. Oh, thank you so much. We appreciate the good feedback. Yeah, it's really good. Thank you so much. You have a good day. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.",
