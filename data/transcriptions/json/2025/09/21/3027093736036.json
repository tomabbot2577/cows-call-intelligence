I have six to seven databases. I want to delete a few of them. I want to close the database entirely. So what is the procedure for that? Okay. The PCR contract signer would have to email support at mainsequence.net, and our tech team would have to delete the databases. Sure. And we will let you know what database, the name of the database, right? Exactly. Yep. okay and that has to come from like that email has to come from the contract signer only or that can come from anyone else as well it has to come from the contract signer okay all right thank you uh i guess yeah that's it awesome all right we'll reach out if you need anything else all right sure thanks get it bye",
