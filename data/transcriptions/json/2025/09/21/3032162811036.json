    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Steve Kuhn. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing fine, thank you. I am calling to get some information, please. I'm currently a subscriber to PCR and have been for a few years now. And I'm going to terminate my account because I am retiring. I'm getting out of the biz. and I've my account is currently on it's been I guess suspended is probably the the best part yeah we call it we call it on hold on hold okay that's good and I've been working with suspended you don't want to be a suspended suspended is what we kind of considered like someone didn't pay their bills so that's something different yeah that's kind of a negative connotation with that word well is let me ask you this is Jim wise he was been my he's been my rep for years and I'm having a hard time getting a hold of him. Is he still with the company? No, not really. No? Yeah. Is he okay? Oh, yeah. He's fine. He's fine. Okay. I know he was there for quite a while. Did he retire? Is he at the biz? Yeah, he just kind of retired. Okay. Good for him. Well, I had called and I left the general mailbox and I received a call yesterday, a return call, but I was unable to take it, from Garrett Kamyadi. And he just left me a message. I haven't spoken with him. Can you help me with this, or do I need to speak with him? What we'll have to do, now the company is, oh, which one do we have here? I have different emails and stuff. What's your company name and email? The company name is Kesco, K-E-S-C-O, Kesco Group, Inc. Okay. so this one phone number is zero email okay hold on one okay second let's see and which email do you prefer to use i have a gmail one for you and i have a cusco group one uh whichever you think would be best to communicate i'm i'm okay with either one um the kesco group is is via via outlook and the other one's obviously a gmail account why don't Just to make sure, well, I don't know. Do you have any recommendations on that? Well, it's just that I'm going to have to create a ticket. We have to go through a review whenever there's any kind of cancellation request. Okay. Okay, cool. So I have to create a ticket. I just don't know what to do. Let's use the Kesco Group because that's what I've been doing most of the business. That's just in my outlook. So it's steve at thekescogroup.com. Okay. Is that what you have? Yeah I got two it's just in the help system it's listed as one way and then in our database it's listed another way as far as we also kind of use PCR to track ya. Hold on one second let me add this email make this the primary. Hold on one second. Okay. All right. So what I'll do is we'll have to kind of do a review and then get back to you. Would that be okay? I'm sorry. What was that? You need a review and what? Yes, we do have to make a review. Okay. To, you know, see is the account, like, because there's contract terms and things like that. So we have to make sure that everything is aligned there. So we would have to kind of go through that review process and then get back to you. Would that be okay? Sure. I'm going to make the ticket, which is for tracking. What does the review process entail? So in order to cancel a contract, so there is a contract that would have been signed and usually has an auto-renew period. You know, are you within that contract, but before the 30 days expires, is there any unpaid balance? So there's a lot of things that we have to look into first. okay when are you looking to cancel just right right now okay we i have been going month to month it's been it's been on hold since march and i've been paying 20 a month i wasn't going to renew for another year and i was working with jim and he said that he would give customer service or whomever the heads up that that's what was going on because i'm just a one-man band it's just it's just me i don't have a team i don't have you know it's just my single desk yeah you might pay Monthly, but that doesn't mean it's like a month-to-month contract is the thing. So that's why we have to take a peek at that. Sure. I understand. Okay. I mean, I was on a contract – or excuse me, I was on a – I think a two – I've been a PCR user since 2019. And I don't know if I had a two-year or a three-year or whatever it was. I can't remember. Yeah, which is why we have to go through and we have to, like, review all that. Right. Right. Okay. But yeah, I've been on hold since March of this year. And then again, working with Jim, he just said, you know, just let me know and we'll take care of it. I don't think that I'm going to be on the hook for an additional year, or I certainly hope not. So anyway, so that was my understanding. Yeah, we would just have to take a peek at it. I don't have any answers at the moment. Okay. But I will get them for you. Okay, great. Do you have my phone number? Is it 966-4090? Yes, area code 404. All righty. I will get that handled for you. Do you need anything from me in the meantime? At this point, no. It's really just kind of taking the time looking everything up, and then we'll kind of figure out where things stand, and then we'll get back to you on that. Great. also in the highly unlikely event that I want to get back in the biz if I pull the plug on this it's gone right my database all that is gone I have to start after a certain period of time yeah look I mean you could request like a data request would be like a 175 and then you have that restored if you ever come back it just kind of it really just kind of you know depends on things okay well I'm not planning on it but you never know the way the world is today you never know what happens but as of right now as soon as main sequence does the review Robin if you can get back to me and let me know what's what let's go I want to go ahead and pull the plug on this if you don't alright all right okay and you know you don't need anything else for me at this time I don't think so. Okay. Okay. If we do, we will definitely reach out to you with more questions and then otherwise we'll be kind of send you a summary of like what's going on and what the next steps would be. That sounds good. I appreciate your help. Thank you, Robin. You're welcome. Okay.",
