    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yes, and we kind of have a bad connection, and I don't know why that is. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. It's a little distorted. Okay. I've been a PC recruiter user for like 22 years, and I, you know, use my database just to maintain my data for my recruiting operation, right? I'm self-employed. And I have a question. I can't find how to get into help. My question is I want to set up the two-factor sign-in, and I've never been able to determine how to do that. But I know you've changed some things lately, and I go in and I click under the support, but I can't get in. I've never logged into your support portal. So this morning I tried to, and obviously I couldn't get in because my name and my company are already in there. So my first question is, can you help me set up my two-factor sign-in? And the second thing is, how do I sign in when I need support? I don't know how to get into your support portal. Oh, sure. Yeah, I can definitely help you with those things. So let's start with the two-factor authentication. So go ahead and log into PCR. I'm in. Perfect. Do you need my name or my company or anything? I have you pulled up as Susan with the Park Pharmaceutical Surgery. Yes, that's me. Excellent. So if you just go to System in the main menu at the top of PCR. System. It would be kind of in the main menu by MyPCR, Dame. Right, I see it. I clicked on System. Oh, excellent. Then on the left, go to Users. Okay, user. Okay. And then manage users. Perfect. Okay. And then select the username from that list you want to adjust. Okay. And then in the bottom frame on the left, go to the security icon. It's a padlock. Okay, well, mine looks different. It's at the bottom. Okay, so it says Susan J. Password. I don't know what model user means. No, and that's all it says. Okay, right. So to the left of that there should be a security padlock. Yep, perfect. Do you want me to click that? Yeah, click on that. And then there are a few headings here. You want to expand the bottom heading that says Security Policy, if it's not already expanded. Okay. And then... Oh, two-factor setup. Okay. Exactly. Yep, click on that. and then check on that top box that says enable under TOTP authentication and then configuration below that is okay yes let you know how you want to set that up. It says configuration and it says X email not configured and mobile app not active. Okay so then below that where it says allow the use of these authentication providers, check the box next to send code via email and hit reset. So that will send you a code so that you can set up two-factor authentication. Okay, so two factors was reset. Okay, so then I do enable again. Yeah, up at the top if that got disconnected go ahead and check the box for enable at the top and then it's like making me reset it again oh so so the next step would be it it will become configured I guess the email part will say configured once you jump over to your email and look at the email that was just sent to you which will complete the setup. I don't have an email yet. No email? Okay. Check one thing here. And it's you know I know y'all have my email so I get my bills. Right so this would be sent from your database rather than from us so let me check. Oh well I don't know. If the email is connected in your database once. Well, the configuration still says email not configured. I don't have – I don't send emails from my database to anybody. I just don't use that. Okay. So we'll need to set that up so that you can get the initial email. And I can – I'll show you how to do that. So let's do this. If you go back to – See, I saw it. Okay. Oh, you didn't get the email? No, I didn't. So back to what? System administrator? Go to system up at the top to kind of reopen the system settings. Okay. And then, let's see, on the left, we're looking for email setup, about the fifth or sixth option down. Right, yeah. And then on the right is outgoing mail setup. And then here we would connect to your email so that it has an email address to send that two-factor setup email. But this doesn't mean anybody's going to get emails out of my database. No, this would just be like notification emails that need set things like password resets or just, you know, general notification type emails. Okay, so this is not anything that's going to activate emails going to people in my database. Right. Yeah, it's just to do general notification type things. To me, okay. Yeah, who's your email provider? Is it Google or Microsoft Office? Outlook, Microsoft Office, yeah. Okay, at the bottom, click on Sign In with Microsoft, the black button there. And it'll prompt you to kind of log in to your Microsoft account. Oh, I have no idea what my Microsoft account is. So I guess we're not going to go anywhere with this. My IT guys do all this for me. I have no idea. I just have no clue what that is. I have no idea. I mean, at all. I mean, it's written down somewhere. But I'm taking my computer in week after next. So it would be nice if I could tell them how to do all this. So I'll make sure that they. Let me give you some instructions. I'll email you step-by-step how to get this email connected on this screen and then to, you know, resend yourself the two-factor authentication set up email. That would be good because then I can take it with me. I give them my computer for like two or three days a year, once a year, and they check everything I'm doing that week after next so they can just do that for me. Excellent. Okay. And then also, you're going to send me that. But how do you get into support? If I ever need support these days, I mean, I have to call because I can't get into your support. It won't let me in, even though it has me already in there because I tried to go in under, you know, set up a new account, but I'm already in there, but I don't know how to log into it. Okay. So if it mentioned that you already have an account, it looks like you have the username part right, and it's just probably the password. Well, let me see if I did this wrong. Hold on. Let me try this again. How would it go? I think I just put my name and not my company. No, it wouldn't let me in again. I did Susan at pharmaceuticalsearch.com, and I did my password that I used to get into PC Recruiter, and it wouldn't let me in. It doesn't email. Okay, yeah. This would be a separate password from your PC Recruiter database, and you might not have set this up in the past. I never did, but the thing is, I don't remember ever setting this up, so I went into the Are You a New User sign-in, and it wouldn't let me in because it said I was already in. Okay, that's all right. You can still put in your email address as your username, and then hit Forgot Password, and it'll email you a way to reset that password. Oh, because you know what? I put my name in before and not my email. So let's see. Okay. Oh, wait. No, no, no. My name. Hold on a second. So logging in is making me put my name. So I'm putting my name and then my email address. And I'm not a robot. Oh, gosh. It's making me select squares with motorcycles. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I didn't put the guy's helmet in it. I guess it's fine. Okay. I hate those things. Oh, and it says email has already been taken. Okay. So is there any button that you see that says forgot password? No, there's not. I was looking for that before. Yeah. Oh, okay. So let's see. Let's maybe back up to the main support. So you would just want to go to help.pcrecruiter.net. Okay, wait a minute. Let me just type that in. Okay. Oh, that just gets me to the login screen. Your account's not found or is not available. That's so weird because I didn't even put an account in there. Oh, oh. Let me double check here. Oh, I'm so sorry. It's help.pcrecruiter.com. That was my bad. Okay. slash support sign up. Okay. All right. This is the same screen exactly, but I'll try it again. My full name. I think it would be on this first screen that has the forgot password. Let's see. Why don't you take out the URL at the time of your web address. Take out anything that says like support or anything after help.pcrecruiter.com. So you just get to the main. page. Okay. Okay. Well, it looks the same. So I'm doing my email address and I'm putting my password in. Of course, you know, I'm going to exceed the magic three and I'll, yep, yep, yep. It should be low. Do you see buttons that say continue? Oh, yes, I do. No, wait, wait, wait. Here's an opportunity. It says forgot my password. So I put my email address in and I've got to do this not a robot. And then I've got to do forgot my password. Okay, so reset my password. Now, is that going to, okay, so, all right, hold on. This is not going to affect my password to PCR, right? No, yeah, this is a separate connection. Okay, well, yeah, so I don't even ever remember setting this up before. Okay, so let's see. I've got to figure out something creative. Okay. All right. Let's see. Oh, the email does not match. Three attempts left. What the heck? I said to send my password. I forgot my password. Okay. Reset my password. Okay. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. I'm going to go back to my email. Okay, it's not resetting the password in other words. Instructions have been emailed to my address. Hold on a second. Okay. All right. To request a change in your password has been made. To reset the password, click the link. So we're clicking the link. Okay. And it says, we're sorry, but we cannot locate your account. We're having issues. I just can't get this done for some reason. I mean, I'll try one more time. But it's not letting me reset the password, essentially. I can't reset my password. Okay. Let me take a look here. You have, let's see if you have any tickets open in the past here. Probably not through the system. Yeah, it doesn't have any opened up. And you were using the email address Susan at ParkPharmaceuticalService.com. And I got the email to reset the password. Actually, I got it twice. Password reset, and I clicked on the link to reset the password. Oh, now I've got it. Hold on. Enter password. Changing password. So hold on. Okay. Okay, wait a minute. Let me try and see if it works. That is so strange. Okay. I hit update and logged in. Okay. So I must be in. How can we help you? So now I'm in. So that's a conflict. Okay, good. Awesome. All right. But I just need you to send me the stuff on the two-factor. Two-factor. Excellent. I will send you that and also instructions on how to get that email set up first so that the system can send you an email for two-factor. And I think that's how I make sure. And so, yeah, I have Susan at parkpharmaceuticalsearch.com. That's the right place to send that to you. Okay. Yeah. Awesome. Well, I'm sorry. It was so difficult. No, that's it. And I'll have my guys try to walk me through it and get it done. Awesome. And another thing to mention, too, is that Help Center, that is a great place to open a new ticket and kind of check on the status of your already open tickets. But kind of as a shortcut, you can always just email support at main sequence dot net. And that'll open up and take it with us as well. OK. Without having to log into that help center. All right. OK, well, thanks a lot. I appreciate your time. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else. Will do. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye.",
