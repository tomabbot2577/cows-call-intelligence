    "text": " Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Melissa. Hi, is Kathy available? May I ask who's calling? Sure, this is Robin Montoni. Okay, just one second. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Kathy? Hi, it's Robin. Hello. Hi. I have a question I'm a little stumped on. Can I have you look up a customer for me? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. William Hague, H-A-G-U-E. Yep. he had auto pay set up when he paid the, when he made his payment on June 27th and it's gone. And he's like, okay, why did I get this 10 day notice thing? And I said, well, I see you have auto pay on. So I even did the click here if you wish to auto pay. And when I go to history and go to transactions, it's like, it's not even trying it though. Do you know what could be wrong? I've tried to click here to auto pay even twice I'm waiting a little bit before I even called you yep some reason Billard Uni is making me sign in like I have to click a link in my email just sign me in it's annoying isn't it I feel like it makes you do it at least once a day so William Pegg so it says under history yeah it's got the June process of 627 yeah so it should have automatically processed 727 and didn't it should have and then I went in the customer area the red banner is there I've tried it twice now I've waited like five ten minutes sometimes it's well yeah because sometimes it takes a couple of minutes for it to process because I've done that before and I did it twice and I was like, oh. But it's like not showing anything that's been at least 10 minutes now. Yeah, that's kind of weird. I don't know why. And it doesn't show that the auto pay failed. Let me check one other thing. Let me check the auto pay declines. I wasn't really sure where else to look. Oh, it says an error. It says an error response was sent from the gateway while trying to create a sale transaction. The credit card has expired. That's why it didn't pay because his credit card has expired. Okay. Let me see. Can I see? He needs to update the credit card because it says that it expires. I wish there was a way to see that. Well, yes, and there was a couple of notes. So if you look at... Oh, it is 0625. Okay. The store payment method. Yeah, but under reports, there is a... Okay. Let's see. Customer reports. It'll show you three different sections of items. And I saw that last week, and I meant to send it to you. and I give. So, come on, it's being really slow. It's thinking, thinking, thinking. Oh my goodness gracious. Why does it take this much thought? So reports and then customer reports. So when the card's expired, it doesn't even try to process. that okay no the no the expiration date is required it has to have a current expiration date okay so won't even come back declined and that's where things are messed up okay maybe that's what's going on there was another classroom like why didn't this process and it was a pretty decent was it Delta diversified maybe okay so well if you're able to pull up the customer reports under reports on there the first section tells you like just like all the customers that are in the system that has put their stuff in their emails confirmed the second group though says stored payment method and it tells you what is expired like world bridge partners Cleveland their card has expired and I And I'll tell you if it's auto-enabled, and it says William Hague and his expired in June. And they're red. And then you can see anybody that's red. Another one is Thomas Perry. His credit card has now expired. And I would have thought that an email would have gone out from Billergy, but they might not have paid attention. like the Bishop Group, theirs is now expired. Calent Partners, MRI Maryland, theirs expired. Sharp Solutions, theirs expired last month, so they probably have one outstanding plus potentially one in August, depending on when they bill. Yeah, so that's where to find, you know, if there's any, you know, question about if anything has expired and who's actually set up on auto pay because it will actually tell you on there if it's set up for auto pay or not. Okay. Mr. Cleveland downtown, he's expired. Mintz, North America. So it looks like I can do store payment method. I can sort it by expiration date too. There we go. I could sort it. Okay, well, this is a new list. Okay. Yeah. I'll have to add these to my collections list. Yeah, yeah. I've been going through. I've been emailing, getting in trouble for a couple. I don't know. I have no idea what happened. Somebody recluded me. I'm mad because, I don't know, I sent an email. or somebody sent an email telling them. Which one is? Recluda. I don't know. How do you spell that? R-E-C-L-U-T-A. I don't know. It's one of Tino's. Anytime it involves Tino, I swear I got half the answer. From Costa Rica. So, yeah, they haven't paid since a payment in May. so they haven't paid the May, June or July invoice. They had a sales receipt so I've been kind of looking for those to be honest if they have a payment method in QuickBooks that still works like if it has a this has an expiration date of 12-28 actually I've been going in and I've been actually charging those in QuickBooks. And I'm going to, if it's okay with you, I'll charge one and see if it works. Is he, was he, I didn't, well, he would have gotten an email from Bill or Jeannie, not from me. But was he saying he doesn't know why it's not paid? I don't even know because I have, some of them like the invoices are actually set up to go to Tino, which I don't know why. And then he's like, oh, well, you got to track down that person. Like it's always a pain in the ass when it comes to Tino's customers. he doesn't really work for us he kind of like independently does stuff and but he's always the one like oh they need a special invoice that like you generate it he was the one he's one of his customers where they're like generating monthlies but then replacing them with quarterlies and i when i do like four quarterly invoices and they're scheduled once like it's so ridiculous like we don't have it's ridiculous it's too many exceptions like you know yeah with international okay so i went ahead and i i actually charged the card in quickbooks for may and june and then i'll wait my like a week and a half i'll put it on my calendar i have a several of them like that and i put it on my calendar and then i'll go in and charge it in quickbooks again because they're not responding to Bill or Jeannie and they have a valid payment method in QuickBooks. So, um, so I'll get the July, um, caught up in, uh, you know, in like a week and a half. Um, hold up a little bit cause I'm trying to email people and even seeing like if their emails are bouncing and a whole bunch of other stuff too. So, um, and I'm, and I've actually kind of revised my email a little bit, just saying to give multiple invoices, just so you know if you were set up as a salesperson. If you were set up for auto pay before, you've got to do it a new one. So I've got a bunch more I still have to reach out to. Okay. I was working on it. I'll say go ahead. So I'm still working on it today. Okay. I'll get through them. Well, I'll record it, like, to check on it by the 20th because it builds again on the 28th. So I'd like to have it caught up before the 28th. the 28th. So it just has to be one payment then. So I'll put a note to check on it by the 20th to see if you put any new notes or anything in there. And I'll, I'll put a note in there that, that, that I've billed it through QuickBooks. Let's see. That way, you know, what's going on. since no response to Bill or Jeannie's setup. So I put a little note in there so you'll see. So I did pay two of those to catch that up, but there are a handful of those that I've been doing that for so that they stay current and don't get, you know, all past due and stuff if they still have a valid payment method and they've not responded at all to bill or genie if they have any response to bill or genie then i don't then i don't do it okay all right well i uh we'll go through and add these to the list too So, okay. Yeah, it was Delta Diversified was the one. Okay. I'm going to take my little email and revise it. Let them know that the card is expired. Yes. Okay. All right, cool. Yeah. If it's the same card, but it has a new expiration and, you know, CVV, I mean, I get, well, it's better if they just do it themselves. I mean, they could give it to us, but I don't know that we can just edit those. I think they have to do it. My mistake. Stored payment method. Stored payment method. I think it says delete, but I don't think it says edit, right? Correct. Yes. Yeah. So we could delete it, but we can't edit a current because we're not supposed to have that detail information. You know, that's supposed to be they're putting it in to maintain their own privacy and security. You know, they're the ones entering their information in, and it's not visible to anybody else but them. So that is a safeguard. That's a safeguard. Okay. Alrighty. Well, that helps a lot. Thank you so much. At least I know where to... You're welcome. The problem is going to remember where it was, but at least I know why and for now how to get their customer reports. Thank you so much. You're welcome. We'll see you. Bye-bye. Bye.",
