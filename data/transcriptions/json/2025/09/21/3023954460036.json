    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Jen Quinn calling from AllPro. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Thank you. I have a question for you about timesheets. Okay. So we sent a reminder to one of the approvers to approve a timesheet, and she said that when she got the approval request, She actually denied it and put notes in as to why. But I, nor my other associate, received an email response, you know, stating that her timesheet was denied and or the information. And I can't find it. So, like, where does that go? Like, I know if the approver, when the approvals come through, whoever's listed gets an email saying that that timesheet's been approved. But this is the first time somebody's denied one, and she said she put a note in. But I don't know where that information is, because if I go into this individual's timesheet, it just looks like it always does. Okay. What is, are you in the default database or the all pro database? Yes, I'm in the default. All right. And what's your username? JCQ. Perfect. All right, let me take a look. Sure. Okay. Timesheet. Notification. Notification for rejected timesheets. I'm sorry. That should be sending to contractor and recruiter. Okay. Yeah. I want to know what these are. Did it come through? Okay. Because I would have assumed it would have come through as an email saying, hey, it's been rejected. Because, you know, we just sent another reminder today and she called and she said, hey, why are you resending me the same timesheet when I rejected it? And we didn't know. Right. So there is a timesheet form letter set up called timesheet not approved. and it is configured to send to both the contractor and the recruiter when it's been not approved. Okay, so I am listed as the recruiter on here, but I didn't get anything that she denied it. Okay. Okay. It would be, I think it would be sent from, let's see, your overall database notification email, which is, let's see, jennifer at allproplacement.com. That's my email, but I didn't get anything. Okay. I wonder if, let me test that connection one second. Sure. I'm checking my spam now, but I would assume if it came from PCR, you know, I should get it. Right. Oh, okay. So the outgoing mail settings or the email address that your overall database uses to send notification emails is currently not connected. So that's probably why you didn't get that email. it just needs the connection re-established so I can show you where to go there. That'd be great, thank you. Let's see, is it the, yeah here we go. Go to System in the main menu up at the top. Email Setup on the left. And Outgoing Mail Settings on the right. And just click Sign in with Microsoft. I did recently have to read, and I did go in here and update it, but I had some spam issues and had to, or hack activity, and I had to reset my email. Okay. So go ahead and sign in here. Yeah, click the sign in with Microsoft button. Sign in. Almost there, just waiting for a text. Good. Yeah, and this is separate from the username's email connection. This is kind of for the overall database. Okay. Good to get this working then. Definitely. Yeah, all the notification emails will come from here. Okay. Okay, it's on the authenticator app QR code and I hit next, it's still circling. Okay. Yeah, it's sometimes it'll give you an option like I can't use my authenticator app now and then you could choose to do an alternate, like just sending the text message. So if this gets frozen, you can just close out of the pop-up window and then click on the Sign In with Microsoft again, see if there's any alternate options there. Yep. Okay. It says Save Successful. Oh, good. So hit Test Connection on the right, see if it has any green lettering somewhere in the test results. Yes, the status. It says status, and that's green, and it says test completed. Perfect. Okay, you're all in good shape. Just hit save on that, and you should be good. So moving forward, you'll get all the notification emails. They'll come through to me. Okay, perfect. Yeah, that last one just kind of fell through the cracks that way. Awesome. Well, thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else. Okay, have a great day. You too.",
