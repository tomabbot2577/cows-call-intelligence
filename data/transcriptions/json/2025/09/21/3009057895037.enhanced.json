    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Butch Sweetheart with the MegaPoint Partners. How are you? Good. How are you? Not too bad. It sounds like you guys have updated your own system. I used to have to dial four to get you. Now I guess we dial two. I was struck by that. I thought, wow, that's weird. Anyway, I got something that showed up I've never seen before. You know, I've got my PCR open, and I've got a candidate record open, and, of course, I clicked on summary, and I've used dark mode. And what I'm seeing is like a white bar all the way across, and if I type in it, it types and just – it's like looking at a piece of paper instead of dark mode. Is this a glitch in the system, mine, or is this something you all changed or what? Oh, yeah. So we did recently update the summary section so that you can have formatted summaries with like bullet points and, you know, bold, italic, all the various toolbar options there. And so you're saying when you're in dark. Here, actually, let me switch my database to dark mode so I could probably recreate what you're seeing. One second here. change my theme dark mode and it'll log me out there we go and let me go to my summaries okay yeah so the um so the box where you can type in is in white rather than in dark mode i see okay i just want to make sure it wasn't something weird going on with my system. So I thought, well, quick phone call will solve that question. Yeah, that's how it's supposed to look currently. But it does look like, you know, other areas keep the dark background when you're in dark mode. Everything else is dark. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, maybe I'll mention it to our, I'm going to mention it to our team just to see if that's intended or maybe that's something they can adjust for the dark mode users. Yeah, I mean, it's not a killer. It's just starkly different from what I'm used to, and I'm going like, well, man, I wonder if there's something in my system that's going weird. And so once another computer logged in, did the same thing, I thought, no, it's got to be something in their system, and maybe it's just a change. I just want to be sure that that was okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. Cool. All right. Well, very good. You answered my question, so no problem to solve. I appreciate you, and have a great day, Garrett. You as well. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
