Hi, Karen. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. It's been about a month since I've heard anything from you. I wanted to circle back, see if you had added those users we were talking about bringing on board yet. It looks like there's maybe five new ones since we last spoke. I'm showing a total of 37 this month. But I just wanted to confirm with you if that was it or if maybe they haven't all been added or just kind of see what's going on. I also think you were looking at the PCRM, so I wanted to see what your thoughts are on that and just kind of check in in general. Give me a quick call when we get a minute. Let me know how I can help or what users need to be added or if there's any other questions or anything else I can help you around. Phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. I hope you're well. We'll talk to you soon.",
