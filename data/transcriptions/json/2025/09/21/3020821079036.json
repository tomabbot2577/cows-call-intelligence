    "text": " Yes. Can I have you hang on just for one second? I'm so sorry. Can you hold on? Yeah, sure. Okay. Jim? Yeah. I'm sorry about that. So I've only had two calls all day, and, of course, they've been the two times you've called me. Just the way the world works, right? For sure. I pick a popular time. Okay. So the scoop for us is we really haven't been using PC Recruiter for several years. One of our team members actually wrote a software package for us because we do things so differently. And so it's kind of very unique to what we do. And every time I want something different, I say, can I have this? And they say yes, and they make a change, and I have it. So at this point, we just were keeping it. We kept the one license just so that I could look back at people and see if there was something I wasn't recognizing. But it's been such a long time that I think it just doesn't make it. I don't do it anymore. So I thought I would just cancel. And you guys have been awesome. There's nothing you did at all. It's just that we had some things that could help us if we really customized it. And so that's what we did. Perfect. Oh, no, I get it. I get it. We always like to just know why anyone's leaving. Yeah, I don't blame you. I don't blame you. Yeah, so what I'll do, do you need a data return? I don't recall if we knew that or not. do I need data return is that what you said yeah yeah no no I don't okay no data return and I will go ahead and cancel it and I'm just looking here I think you were still under contract I think is what so there might be an early termination fee roughly and it might be I think it was going to run about 496 because you're still under contract till like February I think it was or March March 2nd. Well, do me a favor. All right. So do me a favor and check it. I mean, obviously, I'll have to make sure that it's not more than if I just keep paying your whatever I'm paying a month. So if you'll just double check that for me. And if that termination fee is less than what I would pay if I go out and say I'm done, whatever the heck. I didn't realize I was on a contract. I would have done this a long time ago. So that's my fault. I figured I was on a 30-day kind of thing. but it auto renews each year. So let's actually I have it all written out right here. So what it was under condo, get your screen back here. Where'd you go? Yes, you're under contract it was signed in 2016. It was two year renewal. So March of 16 through March of 18. So it has renewed every two years ever since. So it would be through March of 2026. So it looks like if you cancel this month, it would be 1234567 months at 7093 which would be the kind of the, I think she did percent of that. So it would be $496.51. So a hair under $500 would be the early termination fee, as opposed to if you just kept paying monthly, it's $85 a month. So if you kept paying $85 a month, you'd be like $595. It would be a little bit more. Okay. Why don't I make it easy? Our sales right now has not been what it should be, So that's why I started looking at stuff and trying to figure out where I can bring. So why don't I just, I want to cancel. So if you'll put in that I want to cancel and I'll just keep paying this out until whatever that is, February, March, or whatever you said. That way I'll just keep the 80 whatever amount that I'm paying. Okay, we'll keep that. Why don't I just keep it since you don't need a data return, I will note in the database you want to cancel. And I'll note an activity for myself to follow up like in mid-January to get that cancellation ticket in then just so a ticket's not sitting in queue because we don't need a data return. So just keep it set as quo as it is. I'll note your account here, and I'll schedule a follow-up to touch base with you mid-January to kind of get that rolled out. But by doing that, I can leave then without this fee, right? Because you know this? Is that what we're saying? Yes, yes. we're going to, I know you don't want to renew. So that's why I'm putting a calendar reminder two months before it would renew the call because I know you don't want to renew. And I'll type that in the activities too. Yeah. And my point is, but I'm also not paying at that time because I'm leaving because I gave you this notice, right? Yeah. At that time, if you leave, so if you, I would say after you pay your February payment, you'll be paid a full, you can leave right then. Right. Right. Okay. All right. All right. Perfect. Okay. I appreciate your help. it would probably be good if I knew all this stuff, but I don't from all those years ago. So, but you guys have been great. So as I say, you've never, you've been, your support is awesome. And you know, I, I have zero complaints. If it wasn't somebody that I, that works with us that I can call on my supports, awesome too. And then it wouldn't, it would be different, but for sure. Yeah. They're right there. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, Jim. All right. Take care. Bye. Bye.",
