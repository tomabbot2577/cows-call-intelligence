I wanted to give a quick call. You were kind of thinking about the PCRMPs. I think you did a demo with Brian King the other day. I did. What you thought of that? Or did you think about adding it? Or if you had any other questions? Yeah, no, I think we're all set. I think Brian is working out the trainer that we're going to go with. Okay. Okay. So he got you upgraded? Or you think about adding that? We are. Fantastic. Fantastic. Then I will make sure he's got everything under control. Seems like he does, but they had tagged me in the ticket as well, just to check in too. Oh, awesome. Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll get back to them. I'll get it all set up. Thanks. Take care. Okay. Bye-bye.",
