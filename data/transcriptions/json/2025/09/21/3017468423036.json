Tyler, I'm having issues with my billing for Main Sequence because they've changed the billing process. Yeah, let me get you over to the billing department. Give me one second here. We'll see if Robin is available here for you. Okay. It looks like Robin is currently on another call. what I can do is I can rant through you to her voicemail and then send her an email letting her know to give you a call back when she's available maybe you can help me out here maybe you can help me out because they changed the plan because I was on an automatic just on my visa and they were doing it automatically every month and they moved it to a new plan so I went into the system and because I'm in Ontario, it didn't have a drop down from Ontario. So I couldn't complete it to save it when I put all the information in. So I got a note again the next time and said, well, James, we made the change. Go in and I went in, I couldn't do it. So I saved my information and I put Ohio and it seemed to take. I'm unsure I have no idea what that payment portal looks like that's all handled on the billing department side yeah you can take a look at my at my account and tell me how many months I'm behind or what's the story I don't have access to any of that yeah all the billing stuff is separate yeah And then what's a good email address for you? So I can tell Robin here as well Because I'll CC you on the message to Robin Yeah, well what you need is I'm going to be out of the office So Robin needs to call my cell number at 613 Oh, cut out there for a second What was it one more time? 613 613 424 424 2296 James James What was your company name again, James? Gold Gent Resources Gold Gent Resources Okay, perfect Yep, like I said, I'll transfer you to her voicemail here real quick So you can leave her a message But I'm also going to email her as well Yeah, just email her. That's fine. I mean, anyway, I'm getting emails from you guys on how to do this. And I just, until I get back, if they can just charge my visa, it's making this process a little bit more difficult. But if you could send her an email, hopefully we'll get a hold of her. All right. Sounds good. Did you want to leave her a message? No, no. I'll wait for her email. with you okay perfect I'll send her an email right now thank you all right thanks James I like what",
