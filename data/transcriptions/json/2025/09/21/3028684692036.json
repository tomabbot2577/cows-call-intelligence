I wanted to give a call and got your inquiry through our website just now around PC Recruiter software. I thought I would give you a quick call, see if I could help, maybe get something set up or answer any questions for you. I am happy to get something set up. However, I am leaving in a half hour for the day and I'll be out next week on vacation. So I'm going to email you too. Perhaps we can coordinate getting something scheduled the week of August 4th. just in about a week from now or so to take a look at a demo. But get my email, let me know what works, and we can hopefully connect. 440-856-0314 is my direct. Once again, Jim Lombardo, PC Recruiter, 440-856-0314. Keep an eye for my email, and we'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
