Is this tech support or customer support or what do you guys call it? Yeah, this is tech support, client support. They did change some stuff around on the phone. Okay. Yeah, I had a habit of hitting four when I called. It kept coming back. I was like, what the heck's going on, man? Hey, I got a question. When I do a search in PC Recruiter, I have some custom fields I created, and I want to be able to search by a certain field. How do I do that? The custom field is already in the database? I created it. I created the custom field myself. Okay. Are you not seeing it in the basic search dropdowns? I don't think so here. Let me see. Here it is. I have a thing called technology field, and I select IT. So if I go to name and I go advanced search. if you do advanced where it says predefined uh change that drop down to say custom fields custom fields okay and then the drop down immediately to the right of that will have like all custom fields in there okay okay gotcha and okay i got it i got it figured out man appreciate it Yep, absolutely. All right. Thank you, babe.",
