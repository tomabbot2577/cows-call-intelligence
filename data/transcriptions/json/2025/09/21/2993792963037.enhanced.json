    "text": "Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Hello, Robin and John. Yes, hello there. Okay, perfect, perfect. Robin, do you hear me? Do we hear you? Maybe. Robin, do you hear me at all? Yes, I do now. Awesome. I'm plugging. I need a new headset. I've trampled this stupid long cord on it. It's so long. It's like, I don't know, six feet long. So what ends up happening is I roll my chair over it, and it's getting a little, I'll just say sensitive. And it doesn't always want to connect. I've got to reconnect it sometimes. I know. I need a wireless, I think. That's what I have. It works pretty well. Yeah, my chair just keeps trampling it. Like every time you move, it like rolls over it. And so there's some spots I think that every once in a while, if you move it just one way, it doesn't like it. So anyway, that's my big problem for the day, which is good, right? That's my biggest problem. I'm good. Yeah, that's not too bad. Yeah. So, yeah, glad we could connect and wanted to kind of run through just a couple of questions here, John. So I would introduce you to Robin. She's going to be your trainer, getting up and running and trained on PC Recruiter. Hi, Robin. And you've not used before, have you, John, or do you have some PC Recruiter experience? I'm sorry? Do you use or have you used PC Recruiter in the past at all? I did, but it was so long ago. It was like 15 years ago when I worked with an agency, and they used it. So, yeah, not really. Perfect, perfect. And Robin, do you have questions? Do you want to use my questions? How do you prefer to go about a call like this? Let's start with yours, and then I'll jump in if I have any more. I'll go through and I'll just fill out that profile that we used to use back in the day. Okay. Okay. So you are going to be doing, are you doing temporary, permanent? What type of placing or recruiting are you doing, John? I'm doing permanent. Permanent. Fantastic. And what industry or industries? Auto manufacturing parts. Auto parts manufacturers and heavy equipment manufacturers. Those are the two industries. Okay. Cool. Okay. And are you on a Mac or a Windows-based machine primarily? I'm on Windows. Windows. Fantastic. And you prefer Chrome, Edge, or something else? I'm using Microsoft Explorer. Okay. That one you'll want to use at least Edge, if not Chrome, because they don't even really support Internet Explorer anymore. I thought they can't even use it at all. I may be mistaken there. It's probably Edge. I think I recall when they switched me over and said, you know, you're too old-fashioned. You need to get Edge. Yeah. That one probably won't work with a lot of stuff anymore. Like your icon for it, does it look like a blue and green, like almost like a wave, like a beach wave? Okay, so that's Edge. Yeah, yeah, sorry about that. That's okay. There we go, no worries. And who is your email? What is your email hosted there? My email host, it's GoDaddy. Okay. Okay. Do you use Outlook? Yes, I do. I use the classic Outlook. Perfect. Okay. Awesome, awesome. Okay. And do you right now have any data that you want to import? Resumes, spreadsheets, anything of that nature? Yeah, big time. That's one of my goals. I want to make sure I can import that stuff. I have it in CSV form, and I have a lot of data. Is it all one file? It's on a mix of files, probably less than a half dozen. Okay. And then not resumes, just CSV files? Yeah, just CSV files. At this point, they're client contact information. Okay. Okay. All right. No resumes at this point. I'm getting that. Yeah. Okay. Got it. So what I think would be a good plan with that, our first session is going to be more like me setting you up. Username, getting your email set up, getting, we also have like an add-in for Outlook if you have that classic version of Outlook, which is what I was like, oh, good, because I can give you that add-in too. So that first session will be a little setup. And then I think what might be good for like the next session is showing you how to do a CSV import. It would probably be really helpful if you don't mind sharing. Do you know if the format is pretty consistent with each of your files? The format, you say? Yes. Bear with me just one moment. because if any cleanup of the file is needed, it's probably better to do that before you do the import. So, for example, like if the name is all in one field, sometimes it's easier if I look at the file to say, okay, we should split this off before we do the import or things like address. We have separate fields for address, city, state, zip. So if you don't mind sharing at least maybe a couple of the files with me, I could give you my email address and I can review them to see what we might want to clean up before doing the import. Sure, that'd be helpful because I was kind of wondering that myself. Yeah, I like to kind of review them, give you a heads up. That way I don't waste too much of your time talking about the files. I can kind of get a general idea because every once in a while someone sends me some stuff that's like, whoa, yeah, we won't be able to do anything with this unless you run it through. I don't know, maybe, gosh, even now, like sometimes chat GPT can clean up some of those pretty well. But, yeah, it's definitely helpful if I review them just so I have an idea of what needs to be done for the import. Because some things we may not be able to do, but at least I can guide you the right way. Sure. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Okay. Okay. So we've got that. And then do you have any outside partnerships you know of that you want to integrate PC Recruiter to, such as ZoomInfo, HireEasy, Indeed, RingCentral, any of those? At this time, the only thing I'm looking at is the Dunn-Bradstreet Hoovers and LinkedIn Sales Navigator. I don't think LinkedIn will give you data. Hoovers would almost be like a CSV import just like we do. We do have like a Hoovers import. I'll be honest, I wouldn't trust it because I think over time they've probably provided different export formats and stuff. If we do what's called the generic file mapper importer, at least you have more control over what's going where. So I think we treat that just like almost like those other files. Definitely. I have a sizable investment in Hoovers, so I hope we can make it work somehow. Yeah, try to just do a mapping. It would almost be best, you know, just kind of see what's in the data. And usually it's like the format is always going to be the same how you export it. Once we do the first one in mapping, we could save like a template so you don't have to do the mapping each time. I mean, we don't directly integrate with them, but I just wouldn't trust the built-in mapping only because I'm sure it's changed over time or they might give you different choices of what fields to export. So, it's probably better to just kind of do what's called a mapping template. Okay. Sounds good. Because if you get garbage in, then you get garbage in your database. Yeah. Perfect. That is good. So, that is good. And then anything else you can think of that you want to cover in the system, important things you want to make sure to review or anything like that? Yeah, that was a big one. I want to be able to get the mapping or importing, parsing, whatever we want to call it. And I just want that to run really, really smooth with Dun & Bradstreet because that's where all my contact information is coming from. And, yeah, I hear your comments about Sales Navigator. To be honest with you, I've found that pretty useless. But on the candidate side, I'd be open to your suggestions of what works best, what we can do there. So we have an extension called PCR Capture. You get it out of the Chrome Web Store, but if you start from Edge and go to the Chrome Web Store, you can still add it to your Edge browser. What that tool does is if you're on, like, LinkedIn or if you have a Zoom info account, Indeed is another one where it basically is reading the page to create a name record in your database. And then as it's reading the page, we also make a file of that information that's indexed and keyword searchable. So it's done one by one, but you end up getting some really good data with it. So that should be – I could show you that. That will probably be at the end of our first session. Okay, good, good. Yeah, that sounds like it would be especially helpful. So basically in terms of what I'm wanting, that's the main thing is trying to understand or leverage the power of the parsing and import application of this platform. And then third, I can use some help in getting the most usable, powerful desktop that I'll need in terms of making calls with the best setup you think that I can come up with so that things are easy and ready to roll day after day after day. A lot of people do their calls from a roll-up. We have like a sample roll-up stage set up that I could show you. You could always tweak that if needed. And that way you can have like a little symbol, maybe have it pop up in activity or even automatically write in certain activity. So I can show you that. I did have just one thing. Oh, job board. Are you going to be doing a job board? Probably at some point. I'm not on any right now. Okay. Okay. Jim, what else do you got? Those are my main things. That is all that I have. That's all my standard questions. I keep them quick. Okay. Let's see. So when do you want to schedule your first session? Do you have any time tomorrow? Yes. Any day in the p.m. works well for my schedule. Okay. So I got somebody from 1 to 2. I could do 2.30 or 3 Eastern. Let's go for 3 Eastern. Okay. So what I'll do is I'm going to send you a meeting invite. Okay. And then, so actually you'll have my email from that. And so when you have a moment, if you want to send over those files, I could take a look at those too. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. So we're going to go. What did we say? You said 3 Eastern, right? 3 Eastern. Okay. Oh, and do you have RingCentral? I do not. Okay. and it's enterprise right jim nothing's changed there yeah i think it's enterprise there still okay all right all right i will get this meeting invite over to you in just a moment and then i will talk to you tomorrow okay just a quick comment so you sort of know a little bit more about me um you'll need to talk to me uh like i'm a golden retriever um And to show you, this is a big leap forward in my business. You know, I'm one of those guys that's been doing this stuff on spreadsheets and taking notes while I talk and that kind of crap. So I'm really looking to PC Recruiter just to bring me up to current technology and have notes and all the client and can information in one place. So that's where I'm coming from. So I can learn this, but a lot of this will be new to me. Okay. So you're a sales guy, not a tech guy. That's really, really true. I've dealt with a couple of you before in my time. No problem. And just to keep you, you will not be a power user after the first few sessions. Okay. What I like to do, just so you're getting, how many hours was it? Eight hours. So I try to keep it. Now, the first one I might honestly go over like an extra 10 minutes. What I'm going to try to do for you is keep each session like an hour at a time. Because anything more than that is information overload. And even if that becomes too much, tell me. If I go too fast, slow me down. Find one area, get you good there before we go into anything new. So the first one will be a little bit more like the setup. We'll then work on those data files. Then we'll just talk about just adding a company name on the fly, adding a note to the record, adding an activity, things like that. So each session will be kind of focused on one thing rather than high level of 20 different features that at the end of the session you don't remember anything. Excellent. Yeah, that sounds perfect. Okay. And again, I've been doing this a long time. If I start going too fast, tell me, hey, Robin, I need you to slow down. I won't take offense to it. And we go at your pace. Sound good? That sounds perfect. Yes. Yes, ma'am. All right. So I will talk to you tomorrow at 3 o'clock Eastern. And we'll get you set up then. Sound good? Okay. Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Robin. And thanks, Jim. And I look forward to getting this rolling tomorrow. All right. and talk to you then. Thanks. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",

know, six feet long.\n\n20\n00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,849\nSo what ends up happening is I roll my chair over it,\n\n21\n00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:09,772\nand it's getting a little,\n\n22\n00:01:09,792
