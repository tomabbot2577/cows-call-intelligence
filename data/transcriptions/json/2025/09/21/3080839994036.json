    "text": " Thank you for calling me, Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yeah, this is Garrett Komiati. Is it Garrett? I can't pronounce your last name. Komiati? Yeah, that's me. Yeah, this is Charles Bowman. I'm with Bowman Recruiting. We had a few sessions earlier this year, and I hadn't talked to you for a while. Sure. So I've added a recruiter from my company, and I was wanting to see as far as like adding a spot for him or a license for him, I guess, or what the options are for that. Yeah. Let me see here. What we would do is basically the user fee would increase, and we could just put in a ticket to have that adjusted. So let's see here. How many do I have now? I can't remember how much I purchased. You have a single user now. and it looks like that user fee is $50 for the single user monthly. And then, yeah, so we can always add another one. Do you want me to have our salesperson reach out to you who kind of answers any questions about pricing and your contract before adding that user? Well, I need to do it. I mean, I need to have two for sure. Got it. Okay. Does it matter if – right now, actually, I have a – I've had a lady working for me. She's an SDR, so she's doing the calling. I'd actually like those two people to have the access to it. And since they're going to be doing the work, really those two need to have it, I think, mainly. And I don't really need it at this point. I might add it in the future if I see a need. But I think I'd like to have two and have those two people assigned. I mean, does it matter who's assigned to it, or I'm not sure how that works? Oh, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. So you have probably a username that you log in under. And if that one's not being used or maybe a different user is using that instead of you, that would still only count as, you know, that the one account on billing. So, yeah. So we'll just make sure you only have two. You don't have to have three at this point based on what you described. Yeah. I mean, I possibly could add that later on. But right now, I don't need it right now, but I possibly could. You know, just asking that question. Sure, that makes sense. Yeah, so let me start a ticket, send it over to billing, and let them know you want to update it to two users. And then if you have more questions about that, I can have the salesperson get in contact with you. But otherwise, I'll just have that increased by the billing. Okay. How soon will that become active, the two users? Because he wants to do some training, and I just really need to answer them when that might be activated. Oh, okay. Gotcha. So let me take a look at your training hours. Let's see. Because the onboarding training hours that you initially get when you first sign up do have an expiration date, so I've got to check on that. Okay. Let's see. Okay, so yeah, those have expired. back in June, but we do have two options. You can either purchase more training hours or you can use, I can send you links to the learning center. That's all free with the videos as well as articles. Sometimes that might be an easier route, but if you get like stuck on something or really do need that training, you can maybe purchase an hour or two of training. Totally up to you. He's a, he's an experienced recruiter. So I could probably just let him have the online option and tell him if he needs more help, we can purchase that, I think. Because he's not a novice. I mean, he's done this before. Oh, okay. Yeah. If you could email me that, then I'll send that on to him. And for now, we'll just see how it goes, I guess. That sounds good to me. Yeah, I'll send you that email with links to – basically, it's an overview of articles that are – And they could just hit on each one of those articles in that outline and basically know the whole software by the end of going through that. But, yeah, if you need more help, though, just let us know. So, yeah, I'll increase your user count to two, and I'll send you that Learning Center information. Okay. Cool. So if he wants to just get on and start messing around with it, I guess, dude, when would that be available for him, just so I can let him know? Oh, so, yeah, you you can on your end create a new user at any time. And then just basically the procedure would be to say, hey, I created a new user and we can update your billing. But, yeah, you have free reign to create new users, delete users. And I can actually maybe I'll send you kind of separately the step by step instructions to create a new user. And that would be helpful. Yeah. OK. Right. All right. So, yeah, new user for you and then general new user training track. I'll also send those links. Okay. I guess you still have my email address. Yeah, let me double check that. Let's see. I have a Yahoo address. Is that the right one? Well, that's probably my personal one. You could send it to my business address. It might be better. Okay. Yeah, let me know what that is. It's Charles. at my last name, Bowman, B-O-W-M-A-N then the word recruiting.com BowmanRecruiting.com. Awesome. I will send that your way then. Awesome. Alrighty. Thank you very much. Well, reach out if you need anything else. I sure will. Thank you. Thanks.",
