Oh, okay. Are you trying to access your database through Outlook? Yeah, hers is connected through that, yeah. Yeah, that's it just probably means the number for it is expired The portal licensing is a little bit different Or it could just be that there's some older connections that need to be cleared out Give me a moment because I have to go into my old computer to get that out that manages that I don't have it on my new computer yet I was saying two days. It just means a date needs to be extended out. Yes. Okay. She's rarely in the office, but lo and behold, the day she does come. And it pops up. Okay. And I'm sorry, what is your name and company? My name is Jessica with CP Paragon Solutions. You know it's very different when you get used to one keyboard than when you go on another one and it's like much smaller, like tighter. It's like I feel like I'm meeting like half the finger size here. Okay, bear with me one second. So that number that you're using, I assume, or it should be ending in 7533. Okay, let me grab this number out. I will probably need a couple minutes to do this. I'll get this done, but it should get rid of the error. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Thanks. All righty. All righty. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
