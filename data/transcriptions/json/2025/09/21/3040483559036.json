    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Joshua Powell. I'm the finance manager for Grant and Eisenhofer. We recently received updated ACH instructions, and I am calling to verbally confirm those in the 809 if you have them on the call. Let me pull them up. I don't remember them off the top of my head. Hold on one second. Oh, goodness. You would be better than me if you did. Let's see. Yeah, the account number ends in 8809. The routing number ends in 2053. Do you mind if I read them off to you just for confirmation as part of the process? Oh, yeah. Okay. Do you want me to say it or you say it? I can say it. It's fine. Okay. So, account number is 653-688-09. Correct. Routing number or ACH is going to be 021-05-2053. And then beneficiary is going to be main technology. Yes. Perfect. That's all I need to know. I can update that for us so we don't receive these $20 wire fees coming up. Awesome. All right. Awesome. Well, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. You have a great rest of your day. You too. Thank you. Thanks, babe.",
