    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. Hi, this is Doug. Good morning, Doug. Jim Lombardo, PC recruiter, returning your call from yesterday. Hey, Jim. How are you? Pretty well. Good. Hey, I had two questions. One of them I figured out. The second one was, am I in, obviously, the rest of my office, which is relatively small. Are we all on the new version of PCR? Well, let's see. Well, you don't have PCRM. So PCRM is kind of the new redesign. It's more of a CRM, but also has all the ATS functionality. And it doesn't look like you're on that version right now. It looks like you're on the highest version of PCR9, which is certainly a current product as well. You just don't have the PCRM piece, which adds a sales pipeline, a new and different format, but keeps pretty much everything that you have now. Okay. Is that more? Is it the same price? It's $3.50 to set it up. Adds $10 per user per month to your existing rate. So if you want, I could set up a demo, kind of show you around it, see if it's something you might be interested in adding. It's not a formal upgrade. You add it so you could log on via either the current version you're on or the PCRM. you can use either or both or whatever version you want. Okay. Yeah, let's take a look at it. Okay. I could do, let's see, I'm very open Thursday, but maybe this afternoon, like one or two Eastern, or pretty open Friday too. What's best for you? Let's see. I could do two. Well, let's see. You said Eastern, correct? Yeah. Yeah. One or two Eastern. Let's see. One or two. One won't work. I could do 2 o'clock today. 2 o'clock Eastern? Yeah. Okay, yeah, I could do that. So let me email you over an invite at a Zoom. Okay. And we'll share a screen, kind of show you around, show you what it does and how it looks. And djohnson at valorpartners.com. That's a good one. Fantastic. We'll talk today at 2. Sounds good. Thanks, Jim",
