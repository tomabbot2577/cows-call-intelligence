    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Good morning. This is Gus Cawley here in Atlanta. I got a quick question. Sure. This AI quick search thing. Mm-hmm. I have for the life of me tried to figure out how to do this. Oh, okay. Let me check to make sure that it's turned on your database here. Which database are you in currently? Staff Financial. Okay. Like, where do you are? Do you search up top? Is that what it is? Yes, it's a quick search up top, and there's a toggle to turn on AI, and that'll open up a how-to guide to kind of show you how to structure the queries that you put in there. Kind of just common sentence structure works most of the time there. It also has examples. Accountant, noon in Georgia, manufacturing. Is that all I got to do? Yeah, you can try that, see if it comes up with anything. If not, maybe do like a show me accountants in Georgia, something like that, to make it more of a sentence. Senior accountants in Noonan, Georgia with inventory or manufacturing or bill of materials or standard costing. Let me check on, there's some limitations with this. Let's see. So it's not capable of doing or queries. so for example if you do sales and marketing I'll do sales and marketing okay show me senior accountants in New York Georgia senior accountant do I say because it pulled up a job here okay it's pulling up positions okay show me maybe candidates Senior candidates. Yeah. Let's see if that works. Nothing. Okay. Okay. I got three. Okay. And then what does this think? Roll-ups, positions. Okay. Paul Freeman. Will it tell me the total years of experience? If you have that saved on the record, you can search that or just pull up the record and see the years of experience. But it's only searching in your database. If you don't have that data in there, it won't find it. Mm-hmm. Okay. And do you have an improvement coming out on this? I'm not sure. So basically, each time you search, there's a thumbs up and a thumbs down rate to your search results, and that's what will help it grow over time to be more accurate with that kind of just rating score that you give it. Okay. So show me senior accountants in Newnan, Georgia. With manufacturing industry? With manufacturing. Okay. Okay. Let me see. Only six? Huh. Strange. So that's basically how you use it? Yeah. Just kind of a little bit of experimenting there. And you can always get back to that guide that kind of lays out the limitations as well as FAQs by going to more info about AI search at the bottom left of your search results. That will get you back to that guide, and it will give you some pointers and examples on how to use it. Perfect. Okay, buddy. Thank you. Awesome. Yeah, reach out if you need anything else. Have a great day.",
