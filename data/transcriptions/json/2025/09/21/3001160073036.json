    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, hi. My name is Larry Moeller. Garrett, I am with Liberty Group, L-I-B-A-R-T-Y. We are a self-hosted user of PC Recruiter. How are you today? Good. How are you? I just saw your missed calls there. I guessed the wrong name, and I tried calling back Colleen instead. Sorry about that. I left her a voicemail. but okay so I'm glad I got a hold of you what can I help you with today well for whatever reason we froze here in all of our users frozen everybody's gone Colleen is in Texas on vacation I don't know that you and I have ever spoken but I owned this business for 30 something years and sold it to Colleen about a year and a half ago so she and I talked and I talked to our software people here, our IT people. And we've restarted the server here. We've done everything and nothing is working. So we're just frozen. I can't log on now. So can you figure out how to help me, us? Oh, I am not exactly sure since it's hosted on your servers. If it's an issue, you know, it seems like more of an issue with the servers hosting it. Let me see if anybody's available on the tech team. One second. What's your last name, Garrett? Kamyadi. Oh, boy. Can you do that for me? Sure. K-O-M, as in Michael, Y-A-T-I. Okay. And what's your extension? We no longer have the extensions. We just kind of updated our phone system. But I can give you our support. Well, you just called the support line. Never mind. You already have that. Sorry. But yeah, just call the 440-946-5214. Yeah. And extension two. Right. Yeah. And that'll get to the support team. OK. So let me check real quick to see if anybody is on our tech team that might have a suggestion. One second. It's been a while. What became of Robert Eaton? Robert Eaton. I'm not sure. That name doesn't sound familiar. I've been here about two years, so he must have left before then. Nick Killian, does that name ring a bell? No, not that one either. I go back too far. Nick Killian. Okay. So, yeah, I just submitted something into our group support chat to see if somebody's available that has a suggestion. So, let's see. Oh, we're really dead in the water here. Yeah, it's seeming like an issue with the servers that are hosting the software. If the software was working previously, nothing's changed on the software side. So I would imagine that it's just an issue with the actual servers themselves hosting the software. Well, they rebooted and they said to give you guys a call. Okay. Yeah, nobody's really getting back to me here. What I'll do is I'll open up a ticket and I'll tag my supervisor in it to have him take a look today to see if they have any suggestions. His name is Nick Braddock, Nicholas Braddock. He's kind of the head of the support team. I'll just see if he has any suggestions that just might be on a call currently. But if I open up a ticket and tag in, he'll get that as soon as he's available again today. Okay. And then what is your best email address to... Well, it goes through PC Recruiter and I can't get on it. Oh, I see. Okay. My best email address is moellerl, M-O-E-L-L-E-R-L, at liberty, L-I-B-A-R-T-Y.com. Perfect. I'll just make a note that we will be calling you back instead of using email. And my direct line is 865-562-2987. Okay. Awesome. I will have them, Nick, get back to you or I'll get back to you with any suggestions we have from our team. and hopefully we'll get back to you within the next few minutes here. Maybe Nick's just on a call currently. Okay. In the past, I mean, it's been a while since I've dealt with main sequence directly, but in the past we've done log me in and you guys have tweaked in and figured something out. So I don't know how you do that anymore. Okay, yeah. Maybe somebody from the team would be able to take a look that way. Okay. That sounds good. Yeah, I'll get back to you via your direct line as soon as we have maybe a suggestion. Thank you so much, Garrett. I appreciate it. No problem. Have a good one. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
