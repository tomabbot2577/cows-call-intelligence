    "text": " for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Gary Paulbeer with Barrington Resource Group. You and I talked a couple days or so ago. Yeah, how's it going? Yeah, good, good. Just to refresh your memory, I'm looking to get a data backup because we're going to be moving to a different ATS, and I hadn't heard from Brian yet. Did you say he's going to call me, or should I reach out to him? So, yeah, if you left him a voicemail, he should give you a call back. I could also give you his email and his direct dial. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah. Yeah, let me pull those up. And how do you spell his last name? C-A-I-N-E. Got it. Okay, I had a K in there for a second. So his email. Okay. Is B Cain. So B C A I N E. Okay. At main sequence.net. Okay. And then let me find his extension for you. All right. And then, so his foot, the phone number that you would call is this same exact phone number you called first, just like our main line. but his extension is 7776. Got it. Okay, great. So I should just reach out to him directly, and then he'll handle this data conversion for me. Yep, yeah, he'll handle the data backup and the cancellation. The backup, the backup. Yes, right, right. Okay, I appreciate that very much, Tyler. Have yourself a great day. You too. All right, bye now. Bye.",
