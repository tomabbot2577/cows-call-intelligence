    "text": " This is Mike. Hello, Mike. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I got a note here from Drew. He said he had a sales reach out to you, so I wanted to follow up. Hey, Jim. Yeah, I sent a couple emails over the last couple weeks to Scott Orloff, and he's kind of the only guy that I knew that was in sales, and I never heard anything back. And so, yeah. he's been gone for a number of years uh scott has he really oh gosh that's crazy to arizona and now he's back to kentucky got married he's he's doing great but he's yeah he left a few years ago huh so weird yeah i have no idea who the salesperson that i would even work with um basically i think it's pretty simple i'm actually doing a transition and I'm moving from, I'm kind of moving from the link where I post my jobs and they end up on my website. I want to get rid of that feature because it's kind of irrelevant. Nobody ever sees it. I am not going through Indeed and that was kind of like your own, that was kind of the one page subscription that you guys linked to really well. I do post on LinkedIn, and I was asking about LinkedIn, but I wasn't really getting a response. And I've just decided kind of just strategically, it just doesn't make a lot of sense to utilize that. And then having some people click and then go to my website, and then they click and they upload their resume to my database. I think that what I'm going to do is move into much more of a sort of an SEO strategy of having that job website on my mind that would feed to multiple sites and things like that. I think it's going to give me a little bit more traction. So yeah, long story short, I want to get rid of that feature, and I think it's a little bit of an extra cost for me to have it. Okay, so the job board piece, the ability to have that job posted out to your website and everything like that. Let me see if it is part of, usually, unless you're on an older package, everything's bundled in. So you can turn it off, we can get rid of it and disable it. It just wouldn't save you anything there. Yeah, you're on the premium package, which is $1.15 per user per month, and that includes everything. So the only other package, if you were looking to drop packages, that would also drop you down to enterprise. It would still include the job board even if you're not using it, but it would drop off like the analytics, email campaigns, sequencing, stuff like that. Yeah, I'm still hanging on to the sequencing. I don't use it personally, but I've got an associate that does use it. But is it easy if I have an associate that we're sharing the database, which I honestly am not even using it. I'm just not. So I've pretty much given it to her. But my question is, if both of us wanted to use the sequencing, but there's two different email addresses, is that an easy setup? or predominantly do you need to have like it's one email address that can be used for C? In other words, she's got a sequence running and it's going to her email, which is my company, and then I've got a sequence running and it's coming into my email. Is that something that's doable? It would be. So, yes. So you could do that. So when you have your sequences, you can send it out from different aliases, or if you two both logged in, you could set up different sequences and send them from each of your individual emails. It looks like she is presumably using the admin username because I'm looking and that's the only username I see logging in. Yep, it's the only one I've had. I've had it forever. It's literally like people are like, oh, you should change it. It's irrelevant. It's totally irrelevant. I mean, I'm the only one that uses it. I'm the only one that used it. She's kind of helping me. She's a contractor. She's just kind of helping me here and there. I've taught her how to do sequencing, and it's just been easier to have it come into her email so I don't have to mess with it. Yeah, you could do that. So if you wanted to set up, you'd have to set up a secondary username. So you could set up a username under your name. So you could log in occasionally under your name instead of admin and send it from there. and there wouldn't be any extra cost to do it because you essentially even if you had a username and admin the admin username is always free so it's kind of a free one so really there is no change it'll be 115 regardless even if i don't want it so let me ask you this um what happens to the web page if yeah like it's currently it's currently set up to where it goes to cornerstone-ms.com forward slash open positions, I think, and that's linked to Main Sequence, PC Recruiter. We're going to change that, or we're going to have our own job board that we're creating. So what happens? How, you know, is there? Well, I don't know exactly what. Drew, who originally sent over the email to me, he would be the one to know. He would be the one to talk to about that? Yeah, he would know exactly what we would do. So when we turn it off, if it's posted anywhere, the links might still point. I don't know. He would be able to kind of tell you that, give you some pointers, kind of tell you how to best wrap that up and turn that off. So he would be a good person to talk to. Okay. Okay, awesome. I'll reach out to Drew. That's it. Then thanks for your help. Certainly. If there's anything else you need, I'm going to reply back to the email Drew sent me, so you'll have my email address. But yeah, Jim Lombardo is my name, and you can contact me. I'll be your main contact for you since Scott's not here anymore. Perfect. Thanks, Jim. Appreciate it. All right. Very well. Thank you. Bye now.",
