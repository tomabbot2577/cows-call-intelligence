    "text": " Thanks for calling Grice Group in Cary, North Carolina. If you're trying to reach Grice Whiteley, we'll try and connect you to Grice by ringing his office phone, as well as his mobile phone. In case Grice is on a call already, it will allow you to wait up to 60 seconds on hold for Grice to finish it up and switch to your call. If he's not available or can't switch over to your call, it will allow you to go to voicemail. Thanks for calling, and please hang on a moment. Let's jump on a screen share call. Okay. We'll have you just go to a new tab in your browser. Yeah. That is, let's see, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, meetings.ringcentral. Okay. And is it prompting you for a meeting ID? Yeah, it's a meeting. Perfect. That is 1-866-513-022. Okay, 1-865-13022. Fantastic. It's wanting me to open RingCentral. I mean, I use that as my phone system anyway, so. Oh, yeah, that's fine. You can either do that or keep it in the browser, whatever is easiest for you. All right. That's good. All right. Yeah, we're in the meeting now with you. Do you want me to hang up and let's just do this audio thing through the meeting or do you want me to stay on the phone with you? We can hang up. That works. Let me make sure it's working and okay that you can actually hear me in there before I do because my computer had to reset. I had an internet problem yesterday. Okay. I'm hearing an echo, so I'm hearing you through the meeting. I don't know if you're hearing me through the meeting. Okay. I'll mute and then I'll – Yeah, I can hear you. You're a little bit farther away sounding on the video part, but can you hear me? That's all right. Maybe we'll just mute the video and then we could just stay on the phone if that works. But I think you might be muted. Better now? Yeah. Now I can hear it. Yeah, that works. Okay. So I'm going to just let you do it this way. Use the phone and the meeting, I guess. Perfect. And then in the RingCentral meeting, just click the blue share button down at the bottom yeah and select your entire screen up at the top okay I got a two screen set up oh I guess yeah we could drag things over to whichever screen you choose to share yeah that'll work okay cool I can see you have ring central there yeah let's start by taking a look at your outlook setup with PCR the PCR Outlook portal so you want to open up Outlook and bring it to this screen here perfect all right and then start by going to the options button up at the top it's a green wrench under it's under the PC recruiter tab yeah yeah yeah right there perfect and then let's see says grace group and has your username that looks pretty good uh hit test connection up towards the top left there all right that's good okay hit okay and then um in the middle go to auto activities it's the third tab kind of right in the middle there yep okay okay and that has your email address selected that is good uh hit save and close at the bottom right. Okay. Okay, so that is connected up. It should just be automatically scanning everything. Do you have multiple email addresses that you're signed into inside of Outlook? Not that, I mean I've got a separate account that's like my personal emails in Outlook. This is whitely.vt.edu but I like sending stuff through Grice group is just like just that one. I've got multiple addresses where stuff can kind of come into somebody and it forwards it to Grice at Grice group, but everything is out from Grice at Grice group. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. And it looks like Grice at Grice group was the one selected in the settings we were just looking at up at the top. So anything sent or received from there should be recording. Yeah. This is all this personal email stuff. Like just, you know, like whatever, just signing up for, you know, an airline ticket or something like that. Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. And then let's go back to PCR as well, if you want to open that up. Oops. Let's see. Okay. I think it's actually running because I was, let me redo this. I was on my laptop because I had to go work off site yesterday. So let me log back in. Okay, and then go to the gear icon at the top right of the PCR, yep, and go to email underneath that. Okay. That'll open up PCR mail here, perfect. And we'll go to configure at the top left. Okay. And then go to mail servers right below that. Okay. Okay, so it does list two mail servers. One of them is an email that's hosted by Office 365. That one is not being monitored. It says active and for active, no. The other one looks like it is active, but it's like a web mail, probably through your domain or web host. I don't know why I've got two other than they set something up, I thought, for when I did my bulk emails, but that's through SendGrid. It's not through Microsoft. Okay, yeah, you don't happen to have SendGrid. Oh, yeah, you wouldn't have it. This is your incoming mail, so we would look for that in a different area. So what is coming into Outlook versus the one I pay for, you know, for like the website and the mail all in one place? Okay, yeah. So it just depends who is your actual email provider, who's the service provider. So is it Office 365 that you pay for that email address or is it through your web host? No, I'm not paying Microsoft for any because Office 365 is like how I get my Outlook and Word and Excel and all that. I just have an annual subscription for that for the apps, but I don't know what all is going out of there. Because it says it's not even active, right? Right, exactly. I just was checking this because if you actually were being hosted by Microsoft, that could explain why the issues are. So you are just being hosted by your web host's email, web mail. If this is inactive, can I just delete it? Because I don't even know why it's even here. Sure, yeah. You could go to the action drop down to the left of that and go to delete. And it might take a while to delete. This isn't going to delete anything in PCR from it, right? It would no longer list anything on the left there in PCR mail related to this Outlook folder. But it's not being scanned. It's not adding activities or anything. It's totally inactive. I don't know how to log into it or where I would go to log into it, you know? Okay, yeah, then I think that one's fine. You can either leave it or delete it. Having it inactive is the same. Okay, I'm just going to leave it alone because I don't know. I'll mess with it later, but I can always delete it. Okay, yeah. All right, and then go to the action drop-down to the left of the next one, the secure.emailserver.com, and then go to Edit. Okay. And while we're here, just click that Test Connection down at the bottom. Okay. Okay. Okay, that looks good. So this is correctly set up for your incoming mail. It's going to monitor your sent folder, your trash folder. Go ahead and hit close at the bottom right. Okay. And then on the left there's that large folder list. At the very bottom it says Grice IMAP with a plus sign to the left of it, the very bottom. That one has a dash, we don't need that one, but even lower. This one. Grice IMAP, yeah. Click the plus sign on that, scroll down, and then click the plus sign next to inbox and scroll down and this will show you all of the folders that are linked to your IMAP so it's starting at the word grice IMAP downwards this should mirror everything inside of your webmail and so scroll down we're looking for sent okay Inbox, so here's sent. Okay cool. So click on the first one that's called sent and we'll look to the right and we would see 5-22-2025 was the last time something appeared in that folder in your webmail account. Below that on the left it says sent items as another folder you can click on. Click on that. Okay you said I'm not following like it has this is the last time something was sent in this folder from from PCR like going out through PCR well actually these are like yeah what is from a till whatever this isn't like a lot of emails right so what it's doing when we set up that connection and tested it a second ago is it monitors and scans the folders in your webmail app so whatever you know your webmail is your host. Okay. Interesting. Email sent. So, yes. Okay. So, basically, that folder list on the left is matching every folder that is available in your webmail app. Okay. And it just scans it and shows what emails are in there, and it appears here in PCR. So, It looks like you have a sent folder inside of your webmail app and a sent items folder right below that. That has much later stuff. It seems like it's much more of it, too. More up to date. The other one just started in May and did some. I don't know if something switched in May. I don't know. I mean, this is a one-person company. It's just me, so unless I did something to it by accident, I don't know. There's nobody else to have messed it up, you know. Yeah. No, yeah, I'm not sure. It's just kind of how that webmail service provider is configured to have all those folders. So the settings we can do on our end is we can take a look and say, which folder are we naming as your sent folder? So PCR goes, okay, this is what you've identified as sent, so now I know when to write activities and things like that. So right now we have sent items listed as your sent folder. We can try switching it to the one just called sent for a moment and see if that makes any difference, because we did see that some emails just came in just now. I'm not even positive. There might be an opportunity to have them both listed as the sent folder, or you might just have to choose one or the other. We could try that. It seems confusing being more than one place, you know? Right. Yeah, I'm not sure why your webmail is set up like that with your email provider. To have both of those, it is a little confusing. So if you go to configure at the top left, which is a gear icon. Yeah. Okay, on this one that I'm logged into, that I'm looking at, I just sent items? Yeah, just go to configure. Okay. And then go to email folders at the top center. and then in the bottom frame in your action menu, so in that black bar there are a few icons, click on the gear icon and then scroll down. We want to find that heading again that says Grice IMAP without the dash. That one has the dash so we need to find one even lower that has no dash. There it is. Starting there, downwards, we can look for your sent folders. Sent items. Okay. So the one that's just called sent, go to the action draft down to the left of that and say mark as sent items. Okay. So now we're mapping that and pointing PCR to that to identify it as your sent items. Oh, okay. Let's see if we get – so now it says sent folder in parentheses next to that one. And it unfortunately did remove it from the sent items one. So, yeah, I'm not exactly sure which is the right one. It is a little confusing based on how your webmail is set up. So go ahead and close this pop up window with the X at the top right. OK. And let's take a look at one of those examples that you found. I think their name was Holly. And if we're able to find that email that you sent to Holly in your web mail, then we'll probably know where to point those folders and get the correct setup. So let's find like a date and time that you sent something to Holly. wait you probably did respond with that I know you're yeah it was like I think it was Thursday right 825 at 1118 and it's already here I think it gets spacing gets weird when you shrink the window but when I did sent items for Holly how I do is scroll back to see like here's here's what I did one on Friday, whatever. Okay. But the missing one, I think they weren't writing to her lately, you know. So if I looked on... Right. Okay. Yeah, so go ahead and pull up Holly's name record. Okay. And then go to activities, and the one you wrote, it says one specific time I found for her was Thursday, you said Thursday 8-28-25. I'm not sure which date you meant. 8-28? August 28th? Yeah, it says in the email, though, you said Thursday 8-28-25 at 11-18 a.m. So I'm not sure if it was the 28th or the 25th you meant to type. Okay. 8-29. 8-28-25. Oh, I see. Got it. Okay. 8-28-25 at 11-18. That's the right one. Okay. So if we go to the activities tab on her name record. Yeah. And let's go to that date range. Oh, now it's there. Oh, it is. Okay. Where I was looking to find it was, like, in the emails. When I was, like, this is sort of like the shortcut to, like, show all of them. And it's showing up in here. Oh, this is the difference. It's still doing this. So it's not showing as linked emails here. It's only showing it as writing an activity over here. Oh, okay. So, yeah, the emails tab directly looks at what we've called our sent folder. in those settings we were adjusting earlier. So if the email happens to be in sent versus sent items, it might not show up in that emails tab just because we can only point PCR at one of your sent folders. And that's really what controls the emails tab. Okay. So maybe activities would be the safest bet to check to see if something's been sent or received because it is able to record an activity either way since you have your Outlook connection there. Yeah. I mean, it's a little clunkier because it's nice to be able to, like, oh, let me see all the emails back and forth, you know, and that's where I've just got to, like, figure out, I've got to pick one to move. If something's already been sent, is it possible to change what folder it's stored in, you know? You mean on your webmail? Yeah, like can I combine all those sent messages so they're always looking in one place, you know? Or is it just like from this point on I can just, you know what I'm saying, try to consolidate the sent matter, the sent folder? Yeah, I mean that would be a setting on your webmail. If you want to open that in a new tab, do you have like a login in your browser? Yeah, I have to go find out where this webmail is. Let me do that. I've got it on my second screen. Let me work on that. Okay. Yeah, it might be at your web host's website. There might be a login for Webmail there. Then we can kind of investigate. I have a password for it. Hang on. Move that over. Oops. This one over here. I just need to get my password saver up so I can log into it. Okay. Come on. Okay. so I'm trying to get to the email server okay I use it I'm doing it in Firefox because my password saver works a little bit better in that than it did with so where I'm at on it is while you in here I don't need to save it. So this is the people that these are the people that I've been paying for doing email with and not yeah they're your after whatever your host your service provider okay all right if you expand that let's take a look at some of those folders on the left we've got all right let's see scroll all the way down where would list and yeah so there's sent items down there at the bottom left but you also had sent way up there at the top as well yeah I had to switch that's where writers but like ten years ago so maybe this like I could just move everything right if I wanted to um yeah I'm not sure it could be that uh yeah i'm not sure how it's set up where maybe if you go to send an email it's picking which folder to put that sent email into and i don't know how to adjust those settings for your webmail yeah i'm just wondering if like if this is what's sent these are this looks like it's still inbox because it's loading but if i was to click and then drag them i wonder if it's draggable to like move them so they're all in one sent folder you know you could yeah but i don't know if the next time you send an email, what folder it will be. Oh, I see what you're saying. I don't know how to configure that. I'd have to talk to these people to find out how I select the folder that it goes to when it's sending something out. Yeah, it could be. Or it could be that you are accessing this webmail through Outlook, and maybe Outlook hasn't been pointed to the right sent folder possibly. And that's why it created a second one. I'm not sure. It's difficult to tell what's going on because it looks like it's still doing an inbox over here. Oh, okay. It's just not being super very responsive on stuff. Oh, I see. It's just not unloading. Okay. Drafts. But look at the date on this stuff. This is ancient, like 1969. Something wacky is set with this. Yeah. the drafts don't really save yeah there but I was trying to do a scent see what it says it's the most recent scent so yeah it's got Monday 9 8 which is yesterday but I mean so some nothing isn't right it's like very little is going on over here right so some of it goes in there some of it goes into your set items yeah that's kind of where the problem is where PCR doesn't know which one to scan as your sent folder. Everything between May and August was not in the sent folder. It was maybe out of the sent items perhaps down here. Perhaps, yeah, that could be. If I click there it loads it to see if it what the dates are on that one. Because you're saying basically PCR has to point to one of these two things sent items or sent folder right and that's what you're able to see on your emails tab in on a name record and it's point that the you can pick any folder to point it to for showing it on the pc in the tab but you just it has to be one is sent versus some items right um it does does pcr care which one you call it it's like i don't care just tell me which one it is exactly yeah you just point it uh which it it to whichever folder you want. Okay. If you can hang on for a minute while this thing finishes loading, we'll see if it has a date that we're missing. Oh, error processing. So it didn't like sent items. Yeah, try maybe refreshing the page and maybe we can jump right to sent items again. Yeah. Oh, there it goes. no this is not sent because these are not things I just sent items if it's not going to load if it's like memory or if it's a problem with the server I can contact the server people you know like the email people okay yeah Yeah, maybe that would be a step to take. It's, yeah, it's, let's see, sent to sent items. Yeah, I'm not sure. And if we can find the email in Outlook, Okay. Uh-hmm. Maybe that'll give us a clue, that missing email. One of the . For example. Yeah. So that was, what folder are you in? You're under sent items, kind of in your favorites, but I wonder what that coordinates with on the left where it lists all those folders. Right. Is there another sent items down below? Yeah, because these are just shortcuts to it. So let me do, like, under sent. again it's gotten kind of fouled up but I don't know bleak kind of how I don't know why it because like here's one for Holly that I sent to you but interesting because if I send it There's definitely more emails that have gone out, but... Yeah, those ones must be in sent items on the left instead of sent. Yeah, this is sent items. No, wait, yeah, you're in sent currently. Yeah, sent items. Sent is sent items. Sent items was where it looks like more... Click on the sent items about halfway down the screen rather than the one under your favorites. Okay. Yeah, let's see what that looks like. Is that the same thing you're seeing in the shortcut percent items? It's sort of different, like it's just formatted a little bit differently, but I can look and see. These are certainly the more recent of the ones. There's not a there's not a a gap as much in these you know what I mean mm-hmm because I bet there's a gap because I was gone for ten days but that's yeah here's with Holly where was the scent that we saw up here let me go back sent items up here is Thursday for me to and fly back on the 28th so go down this 28th down here Okay, so the first time, here's the Thursday 11-18 email from August I sent to you. That's in a long list of emails. I want to go up here to the sent items up here. It's not the first one on the list. It's just there. We found it. But it does match up. It does seem like that's – Yeah, the sent items at the top on the left there is just a favorite. So it's like a shortcut pointing at a different folder. So I just want to make sure that that was pointing at the folder down below called sent items. There wasn't an additional one that it was pointing at. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so... It's just like kind of random, like... It's definitely very erratic. I mean, there's, you know, the sent in 2024 is all of like 10, 20 messages or something. So it seems like it's random. I don't know what triggers it to send something out of here. Yeah, I'm not sure either. So that's, yeah, I think that's the problem in PCR and in Outlook here. we're just both programs are just mirror mirroring what you have in your web mail so if it's you know if your web mail email service provider is putting something in a sent folder versus a sent items folder outlook will just mirror that there on the left and pcr will just mirror it in our system so yeah i think the the root of the problem is kind of with the web mail and figuring out why you have two sent folders and what causes of email to go into one versus the other okay well my folder system you can tell it's kind of a mess it's just a bunch of old historical stuff i just need to delete a lot of stuff and be okay with it because it's just laying around and easy to be confused yeah yeah that makes sense but yeah if there is a way to combine those two sent folders into a single folder that way outlook and pcr can both point at that one cent folder i think that would be the best way to capture everything okay uh inside of pcr the way you You want to see it kind of in that emails tab, the easiest way to look at it. Yeah, maybe your webmail. Oh, go ahead. So the webmail people here can see all the same folders. And so they're able to look up. If I do tech support with those guys, they should be able to look at them and sort of see if I can combine them, delete them, you know, safely, whatever. Right. But they can see everything that you saw. Yeah, exactly. This is, we're just, in PCR, we're just mirroring what you see in that webmail pop-up window. But right now I'm set to check which folder because that way I can tell the guys which place to put all the emails that I want to move them into, you know. Oh, yeah. Go back to your browser and go to PCR mail tab you have open up at the top of your browser tab. Yeah. We chose if you scroll down in the bottom frame there, we'll just look for where it says sent folder in parentheses next to one of your sent folders. Yes, the one called sent items is what we pointed it at currently. Okay. All right. So that's what's using the tab for emails when I look and like not going through the activities, but just the actual emails tab. Okay. Exactly. So that's like the parenthesis is just like a mark like, hey, this is the sent folder for PCR. Yeah, that's what we pointed it at when we mapped it. And if I mapped it to junk, it would say junk slash or princess sent folder. Like it's going to have that sent folder label wherever that's pointing? Yes, exactly. Okay. All right. So that's good to know where it's pointing. And if I can kind of combine stuff, then I'd have all my emails. Would it eventually, would PCR eventually reflect that? Or is it like now it only reflects it as it comes in? You know, like if Holly's moved over to be in the same place, would they kind of show all those emails as linkable in her tab? Oh, yeah. No, I think it would retroactively kind of go back and scan that. If it did have trouble retroactively scanning things, I would recommend we could walk you through it too, just kind of deleting your mail server in PCR and resetting it up, and it'll scan it just from ground zero and have it all at that right folder. But we could cross that bridge if it turns out that way, but it should be able to retroactively start populating things. Okay. Well, that's good. I'm not sure why it's doing what it is, but I know at least who I can talk to to find out how to fix it. So you did solve that problem. We sort of isolated it with the problems from it. It's definitely not PCR. Okay. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, and just let us know if any other questions come up when you're talking to their support. If you need more information on our end or anything, just let us know. That sounds great. I really appreciate it. I had a separate ticket I put in, but it was somebody else who was helping me on it. I probably don't want to get... issues crossways, but it was something that I'll just let you know. I was talking to an email person about a field that was in PCR because I'm getting ready to pull some more data in. And is that something I should just keep talking to that person? Or we haven't ever done a conference call. He basically just said, hey, that's a pretty new feature, and, you know, you should put in a suggestion for it to be able to do something. And I'm like, oh, it's, you know what I mean? I just don't know. I don't want to get wires crossed, but it's something that's still out there, hanging out there as an issue for me. Yeah, let me take a look here. I could look up any tickets you have open under your name in our system. Okay, Bryce. Okay, here's the ticket. Let's see. Trying to avoid creating duplicates, especially to companies. I'd like to fix the ID thing before I do import. Set OS ID number when a new record is made. Oh, okay. Oh, okay, roll-up list, seeing that ID. Ah, okay. I found that I had a lot of duplicate companies, and I was doing a thing where they don't, I didn't mean to create them, but also like some of them were same company, different locations. And I'm like, at this point, I don't really care. I just want the company listed one time, regardless of the locations of how many offices they have. So when I bring new data in, I'm just trying to avoid, a lot of my duplications were a company name with no address, you know, city, state, and then the same company with city, state, but named the exact same thing. And I was just like, why is it doing that? because certain data was missing on certain ones. So I thought, I don't want to create that problem again. If there's a way to do an ID or something, like make it like a pick list off of all my Excel data when I bring in this new data and force it to go to the existing companies if they exist. That's why I was like, oh, there's an ID field. How does that work? And that's where I was going with the emails. I see, yeah. So yeah, there isn't the company ID that's exportable on a roll-up list as its own column for companies. but what you could do is go through like it there's something called an auditing report where you can see duplicate companies that share the same name and you can just start merging those and then when you do an import next just check for duplicates based on the company name not based on like address or you know location information when you're doing your duplicate check during the import process, if that makes sense. Like if you did have a record in your database that had the company name but was in Ohio, and then you did an import where it was the same company name but in Pennsylvania, if you don't use city or state or location as part of your duplicate checking criteria, you could say just check to see if it has the same name or not, and then it would avoid creating duplicates. When you do the import, it offered several recipes already ready to go, kind of like we can check company name, website, city. We can check the company name in the website. We can check the company name in the city, or you can pick any one field. And so I think what had happened is I was picking any one field because those other combinations didn't work for me. I didn't have websites for every company, so that eliminated the first two options. And the company name and city would help duplicate it, But my test showed if I didn't put in a city where I put in a different city, it was making a new record. So that's where I was kind of coming from. This ID thing potentially could be a workaround for me if we know how it works. But I didn't know how it started incrementing, you know, like what the rules are, like when it starts assigning things. Because you can't really put on a roll-up. I can do a search, but I can't put on a roll-up to see anything in a roll-up to export it, you know, to kind of be able to, okay, start counting at number 400 because I only have 300 records with the ID on it. But is there any documentation about how that field works? Because the guy who was helping me was Tyler, it looks like. Tyler, yeah. Tyler Trotman. And he just said, yeah, it's relatively new, but you should put in a request for it to be able to be on a roll-up list. I'm like, well, that's cool, but it's not searching. If I just search for everything greater than three, it doesn't return that. It returns everything that has a three. if I said you know everything that's you know try to alphabetize it it doesn't alphabetize it it doesn't put it in alphabetical order or numerical order and I didn't know if that's all on purpose but it just doesn't seem like it's working right for it to be very useful as a field if it's an automated thing yeah I'm not too familiar with that it is kind of like a newer field it doesn't really have many use cases that I've seen just because you can't do that exporting. Yeah. So, it shows up in the results, not sortable. Basic search, when searching for record three, for example, returns everything that has a three in it, basic search, so it says everything returns nothing in that record. Okay. Yeah, the less than three is there there's a um well no yeah i don't know if it's looking at it as a number um when you do like a greater than less than equal to or if it's just looking at it as like a string of characters um yeah i'm not sure how that one's built um i'll i'll talk to tyler a to if he might already be kind of researching kind of the questions he sent over after he responded but yeah I'm not too familiar I got this giant list I'm ready to want to pull in it's not that one but basically rows and columns and I can put in a field that could you know kind of be importable to that field like you know ID numbers or something like that but I yeah but I don't know how I don't know what to do that so many that don't have thousands of companies that have no number at all. So if I kind of start it, like I just don't know if there's any documentation to sort of go, hey, here's what we have it for. This is why it's here. This is why it exists. And here's how to use it. You know, if it's something, because I can't control what it does. It's doing some kind of behavior behind the scenes of incrementing. And so it's automatically counting something. But how do I go back and give numbers to the existing records? You know, all that stuff. It's kind of, I could force it, I guess, but I don't want to break it because I can't control where it starts counting again. Yeah, I'm not sure how that's set up. It's more of kind of, I imagine, like a back-end field rather than usefulness on the front end. But if you did import this list, I imagine you would just be able to choose the company name field itself instead of the pre-suggested duplicate checking criteria. Like instead of company, state, website, just choose the field called company by itself. And I think that would just make sure that you have duplicate checking based on just the company name. And it shouldn't create a duplicate at that point if you have an exact matching name. Yeah, that's the key is having the exact matching name. And so far, some of these things, people don't do it the same way. This is just rosters from conferences. Oh, okay. And so sometimes people will miss a comma and Hoyle comma Tanner, the next one will just be Hoyle Tanner. And then PCR is like, oh, that's a new company because it doesn't exactly match. So I had to chat GPT, kind of go, how do you solve this problem? They go, oh, make a pick list and download all the companies from PCR and then have it be, you have to pick a standardized company name from it. And I'm like, that's a great idea. But, you know, in consolidating all that, I just found a lot of duplicates in PCR, and I realized if that numerical thing is something that could help sort of force it, then I don't have to. But I'll just go with the company name thing, I guess. That's probably the way to go. I guess so, yeah. Tyler might have a good answer, too. He might be researching the response you gave. But, yeah, without that company ID being able to be exported as part of your roll-up list, it, you know, loses that key functionality. You would need to get it imported again only based on ID, which you can do with name records. So they really should consider that for company. Yeah, I was just wondering because I just noticed that it existed as like I could put it on a data list. I could put a number in it, but I can't put it on a roll-up. So I'm like, what is it for? And I didn't, I've used PCR since 2005, but like on my own since 2011 when I started my company. And it's just me. But I just thought, where did this come from? And he goes, oh, it's pretty new. And I looked back to see when my record started behaving to add the number and it was 2020. So I'm like, well, it's kind of new, but it's also five years ago. So what do we need to know about it if we're going to use it or do we just leave it alone? Yeah, I'm not sure. yeah what how how it's intended to be used um on the front end it might just be an identifier that the system has always been generating and it just or maybe not it sounds like it just started in 2020 but um yeah i'm not too familiar with it but uh i'll mention yeah i'll mention to tyler to see um if he's he's found out anything more about that particular field and how it can be used. Well, that's helpful. I just, the chat GPT was pointing me in a certain direction. So I'm like, let me see if this will be helpful to kind of use. So it is amazing what it can do, but I've just, at the end of the day, I've got to standardize some of this stuff. So I don't create a bunch of, because going through like the audit record for duplicates, it's still tedious, like just having to come over to refresh. And like, if you have hundreds of them, you know, I, which I did, it's just, it took me, I spent most of the weekend doing it. It's still not kind of done, but it's good enough. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And that, yeah, that process is definitely slow because you really do have to make manual decisions on every single one on that list. So. Right. Right. For sure. Okay. Well, thank you for everything on your help on this email stuff. I really do appreciate you helping me track it down. Yeah, no worries. And I'll check back in, you know, I won't close the ticket or anything until it kind of gets solved. And after you talk to your webmail people, we can. Yeah. I'll email those guys today and see what they, it's their problem is they're always just chat support. So, like, I'll talk to them and see what they can tell me as far as combining this sent folders, and then it might solve the problem. But I don't know where – what I don't know is where the thing is that's triggering them to get sent from a different folder. Like, what's happening that it goes out of that other folder? I don't even know where that folder is. Right. Yeah, that makes no sense. Like, and we even saw one – the craziest part is we saw a lot of them in sent items, but then we just saw one from Monday yesterday go to the other folder called sent. I don't know if it's a random look that's happening or what, but I need to, I need to fix it. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for your help. All right. Yeah. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. We'll talk soon. Thank you. Bye.",
