    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Ashley McCarthy. I am actually an employee of CWP Technical. And I actually, I don't know if you know Garrett, but I just talked to him not too terribly long ago. But so, and he was very helpful. So I got, here's my situation. So I'm an NPC recruiter. Everything's hunky-dory. But I didn't have, and I had the capture installed. I had the capture Chrome extension. But I figured that the capture Chrome extension piece out. But basically, my boss is very concerned that I don't have the floating icon on the right side of my screen for when I go to certain pages. So is there a way you can walk me through on how to just put that on my my page? Yeah. So like the like the PCR capture icons not popping up when you're like in LinkedIn? Yes, correct. All right, let's hop on a quick screen share here so I can take a look. Okay. I'm going to send you over a link here. Okay. Is this, like, via email or is it just going to pop up on my screen? It'll be via email. Okay. Okay, let's make sure I'm in my email. Okay. Let me just grab your email address here. Oh, it's Ashley at cwptechnical.com. Perfect. All right. I just sent that link on over to you. You should get it here in just a second. Okay. Alrighty. I have a love-hate relationship with technology. I mean because I'm like hey I just sent it and then it's like three minutes later but I also feel the same way about like electronic sinks in the bathroom you know or I'm like I just want to wash my hands okay yeah okay I just got it so um uh okay enter my my name sorry enter my name actually join meeting okay join meeting all right and it might ask you if you to connect like video and audio you can just exit out of that part okay continue without audio okay and then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share um hold on i'm seeing any central third party allow all or can i get rid of that Go ahead and hit the allow all. Allow all. Okay. That says how to join audio, computer, dial in. You can just exit out of that part. Okay. All right. I see you. Okay. And I'm on mute. Okay. Perfect. Yep. And then you'll see that blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share. You'll click on that. And you'll want to share your entire screen. so if you have more than one screen you'll just have to click on which screen you want to share it'll highlight it in yellow and then you'll hit share again perfect alright so go ahead and click on the little pinned capture icon that you have up there yep ok ok so that looks good like I don't necessarily want all of these all this nonsense. It doesn't hurt to have them. That just lets you know what site it's compatible with. Oh, okay. So they're not necessarily going to all pop up every time, right? Correct. So go ahead. You can click that X up at the top there. And then let's pop over to LinkedIn. Okay. All right. Now, have you refreshed this tab since you've downloaded the capture tool? No. Okay, go ahead and refresh this. Just hit that refresh. Yep. Okay. Okay. There it is. Look at that. Okay. And then if I needed that, oh, I don't have Zoom Info yet. But if I did the same thing with Zoom Info, it would just be, like, very similar. Just refresh it, download, refresh kind of thing. Yeah, because the way the Chrome extensions work is once you have a tab open, any changes you make to your Chrome extensions won't go into effect until you refresh that tab. Gotcha. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yep. So you should be good to go now. If you go to a different profile, it'll pop up for you. Awesome. Awesome. Okay. Well, then, I think you've already in the system, so I don't need to click it. But, okay, well, that was his main concern was just I didn't have this little floating thing on the right side of my screen. So thank you so much for your help, Tyler. I appreciate it. Yeah, not a problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. All right. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. All right. Bye-bye.",
