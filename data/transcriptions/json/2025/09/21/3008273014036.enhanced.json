    "text": " Hello, this is Mackenzie. Hey, it's Melanie. How are you? Hey, Melanie. I didn't realize when I was leaving that message that we had talked just a few days ago. Yeah. Something else. Yeah. I was looking at this thing. I was like, oh, wait, I talked to you. All right. What's up? Thanks for calling me back. Yeah. No, my layout, my boss wanted to change my layout, and my outlook was PCR recruiter. I think, is that what you were talking about? Is that what you were calling about? The layout portion, I can't exactly make those changes anytime, like, anyone asks me. Okay. Kind of like a – there's, like, a legal gray area there. Well, it's not a gray area. Yeah. It's just, like, it's, like, you know, the layout that you see is, like, a direct, I guess, portal into, like, the data of the database, which you do not own. you're melanie you're not the owner of the pcr account right so you know whatever data is showing on your layout is like not yours and it's not mine either so i can't like show you fields that you're not supposed to see so like those types of things are supposed to be done by like somebody in the database that has admin privileges so okay when people ask like oh i need to copy a layout like there's a function in the database to copy them and we just kind of send over like the instructions on like what to do uh and somebody it's it's much easier for somebody to go in and like follow the instructions than for us to do it because if you have us do it um and i explained this in the email i just sent right before yeah i was reading over it and i saw it was you and then i saw my voicemail um and i was like i'll give him a call basically it's just i'm just reiterating what i said i think uh yeah in the email but yeah it's like we'd have to get like a written consent like you want me to make this change in your database and then you'd have to like detail exactly what you want me to change and then like sign it and send it in it's probably easier to just follow those instructions like i i can walk you through i could walk you through it but i have to okay somebody through it who has permission to do it like um your username my bot alley um yeah can't you you might be able to change your database like like one field at a time okay but like it'd be so much faster for someone to just like copy it it takes like a minute it's just i can't do it yeah i could walk her through it it'd take us a minute or whatever but i can't walk you through copying it if you wanted to do it the long way it would just be so time inefficient because of the way you have to do it but i can't is what you're saying well let's see i don't know I guess, is there like a whole year? I'm not at my desk right now, so you don't have to bust your brain right now with it. I'm not even home at this point. My kids wanted me to run over here to the hobby shop real quick before they close at 5, so I scooted off my computer real quick. Oh, okay. Cool. But if you're telling me that Allie has to do it, I saw the directions that you saw and I'm thinking that we could probably follow them. And then worse comes to worse. I could call you tomorrow. I don't know if you're in tomorrow, what your schedule looks like, but, um, if we can't figure it out, I can give you a call tomorrow. Yeah, I'm in tomorrow. Um, Oh yeah. Yeah. You don't have the customized layout option on your username anyway. So even if it was just me and you doing it through, your username. We wouldn't get anywhere. You couldn't add them one by one. Yeah, that you don't have that customized option. So I think that it's either like you detail out exactly what you want me to change and then like sign it and we have to send you like a form and sign it or you just follow those instructions to copy, you know, a layout that already exists over to your username, which should take no longer than five minutes. I mean, well, yeah, I don't know. It shouldn't be that. You go to copy user settings, you check a couple checkboxes and you hit save. So, you know, it's not that difficult, right? And I took a picture of exactly, like, what you want to click to in that email. Like, the screenshot is exactly, like, what the screen will look like. And if you check all those options and hit save, like, that'll be what you want. Okay. But, yeah, the Outlook, too, you can, I guess, call me back for that, too. You need to set up your Outlook. That's something else that was mentioned. That we can do? Yeah, Ali says we want to make sure her Outlook is pulling in emails she is sending. So I would just have you download out. I thought that it is because I logged into PCR after sending a few emails, and I thought it was pulling correctly. And I will check. I have another call at 6, so I'll make sure. Okay, do you know of somebody you sent an email to? I can check if the activities are writing. um if i sent an email recently yeah do you know of a perhaps a name uh that you sent an email from um yeah um grace um last name is bayless yeah b-a-l-a-s maybe a-l-a-s or something like that yeah okay let's see i was logged in but i'm pretty sure it pulled it pulled and copied over yeah you do have an outlook id uh on the activity writing activity email activity at so that's called correctly right 1 0 6 p.m an email that you are sending outlook id is given um sent from m tanner yeah no it looks like it is set up okay okay cool um awesome all right well looks like you do have it set up uh so it's just a layout thing i think that we have to iron out and again i don't really care about the layout but the boss lady's like hey let's change your layout i don't really want to mess with it but we'll see oh no this layout needs to be upgraded okay okay well then we then we can we can upgrade it what time are you in the office tomorrow I work in the eastern time zone from 9 to 6. Okay. Well, so am I. I'm PA, so you guys are in Ohio, right? Yeah. Okay. Yeah, we're eastern as well. So I'll be in. All right. So, yeah, I can touch base with you tomorrow if that's okay, and I'll let Allie know that my PCR is pulling from Outlook and that we just need to change my layout. Yeah, I can also follow up and tell Allie via this ticketing system that I looked at your, like, you currently have emails being written by Outlook already. So I can update her on that, too. You have an email right here on Grace's name, and it has the Outlook ID and everything. So that means it was written by Outlook. So proof that it works. Love that. Okay. Awesome. Melanie, be safe out there. I'll talk to you tomorrow, maybe. Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. You too. Thank you. Bye.",
