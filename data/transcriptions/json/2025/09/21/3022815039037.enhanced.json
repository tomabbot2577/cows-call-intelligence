    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. Hi, my name is Eric with EJH Consulting. I got a new computer last week, and I need your help to bring in PC. Oh, I'm getting my softwares up. It's the inhaler. What's that called? Let me see what it is. I had it. PCR capture. I need that downloaded into my computer. That is just a Chrome extension. So you get that from the Chrome web store. Oh, okay. Okay. So when you go to the top right of your browser, do you see the extension at all? No, I don't see it up there. Do you see an icon at the top right of your browser? It looks like black puzzle piece that's your extensions icon right top right or yeah top right of your browser okay yeah i i go to the extensions and i turn them on so do i need to start my computer again for it to come on to show you so okay so do you see pcr capture list when you click extensions in your browser do you see pcr capture listed and is it pinned uh no okay go ahead and pin it and that way they don't have to do that hit the details or no so when you click on the extensions icon where it lists all your extensions that you have you'll pin it and that'll make the extension show at the top right okay yeah yeah Yeah, they don't automatically pin them. So once you click on that icon, once it shows, then what you would do is you would have to copy and then paste the URL that you used to get your login page and paste that into the URL field so that it replaces what ends in my company that's used as an example. Okay, I think it's only here. so details it's pinned to the uh all right so go up and just you say like the extension itself and the address bar do what with it so you're going to click directly on the extension up at the top right uh-huh and then what you're going to need to do is um well you probably need to do this first go over to your pcr database because you'll need to copy the URL that takes you to your login page because you're going to have to connect it to your database. Okay. It's got to know where it's pointing to, basically. So, upload URL. No, you're going to copy the URL that takes you to your PCR login page. Okay. And then you're going to click directly on the extension that you should see like a little shortcut for it now at the top right of your browser. It's purple, green, and blue. Mm-hmm. Okay, you're going to click on that, and are you prompted for the URL? Yes. Okay, you're going to paste that into the box that you see. Okay. Let me get back to you. so I'll go back just to the first page which is basic search that URL copy that and paste it yeah it'll be at the top it starts with www.pacercruiter.net just copy that full URL copy paste I need to do something else I think I need to really get out of it start from the very very beginning Yes, and you'll click directly on the extension, paste that in, hit login. Okay. So what I did, I backed way out and I've got my DCR. I was going to log in. This looks easy, I'm sorry, but this helps me out though. Okay. All right. So I got in my software, main software. So at the top, I'm going to cut and paste or copy. And you're going to click directly on that extension that you see at the top right of your browser. Yeah. And then, extensions, paste that in that search extensions or? No, when you see your extension pinned on your, at the top right of your browser, you should see a purple, green, and blue like hexagon just before the manage extension. Yes. Yeah. Okay, click directly on that. Let me know when you're there. I'm there. This is PCR capture. So there's already an address there. Let me back out. This isn't really. But is it ending in my company? You've got to replace that. Okay. So you've got to take the URL that you copied, click in that field, right click and hit paste so that you're pasting your URL. All right. So delete that and then paste mine. No, you can't. No, it's just a display. display. Oh, okay. So just paste over it? Yeah. Okay. It's just a display. Okay. Now it makes sense. Yeah. So, all right. Give me that. Let me log into my PCR capture. This should do it. So, okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. And then do you like to get the company or do you want everybody just going to your default company? Say that again? The company. Yeah, when you're bringing somebody in, let's say, for example, if you're on LinkedIn, you know, in their experience area, a list where they work, do you want them going into based on a company record or do you want them just going into your default? Company records, both. I mean, I've got a roll up I put the name in. Okay, so what you'll probably have to do is in your – at the bottom right of that extension screen where it lists all the sites that you can use it on, at the bottom right, change it from capture to default company. Turn that option off. Okay. That's after I get into my PCR capture. If you click directly on the extension, it should be connected now. well I got to put the username and password in it oh okay yeah after that screen then so I remember what that is all right I know what you're saying and then get back in there and just hit click off the default company that's what you're saying correct yes and make sure you don't like turn on that basic mode I wish it wasn't there like leave basic mode off but you can turn off the capture to default company that way you get the company too okay appreciate it all right let me play with it and I think I can figure out from here all right thank you oh thanks I'll send you over the online instructions to that way in case you want to figure it to use like you know add to roll up and all that stuff I'll send it over yeah that's what I do always just take it and ask to well what I do I had I had mainly put the roll up in so yeah if you're doing this like first time that add to role isn't part of the configure but like you go to the top right and you can um add that in i got it add up okay we'll get those over to you okay i appreciate it thank you all right you are welcome have a great week all right you too bye all right thanks bye",
