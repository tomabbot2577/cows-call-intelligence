Oh, okay. Are you emailing inside of PCR or inside of Outlook? I'm just trying to send emails like I normally do. it's not letting me forward it's not letting me delete the yellow delete or the red delete trash button is just stuck on i try to send an email through pcr and it's not it just says that's um in pcr mail then rather than outlook okay yeah that makes sense yes um so uh at the Do you have that pulled open right now, the PCR mail screen? Yes, sir. Okay. At the top right of the browser, click on the three dots. Three dots? Yeah, there's three dots at the far top right of the browser. Got it, got it, got it. Sorry about that. Got it. No problem. And then scroll down to more tools. It's probably one of the bottom options there. Got it. And then go to developer tools. Oh, shit. Just got away from me. More tools. Developer tools. Perfect. It's just giving me a big error sign on the right side of the screen. That's all right. Yeah, you can just ignore that pop-up. And then up in your web address area at the top of your screen, to the left of that right click on your refresh button oh my god it just keeps blowing me out hang tight dang it okay okay and then click the refresh right click on it so that you can choose empty cache and hard reload it's just giving me errors it's not even prompting me for that okay Let's jump on a screen share so I can see what you're seeing. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Join a meeting. Perfect. And I can give you a meeting ID whenever you're ready. I'm ready. That is 657-454-106. Join. Open Ring Central. Awesome. I see you there. Without audio or join audio. Okay. Just click mute at the bottom left and then click on the blue share button down at the bottom. And let's see. OK, perfect. Go ahead. So I'm looking at your screen that has your desktop background. Go ahead and open up the browser, Google Chrome. Shit, where? It's not... So at the bottom of your screen by your Windows logo, there's a couple icons down there. Click on the Google Chrome. Yeah, that's to the right. It's where you just were. It's a circle. That's it. That's Google Chrome. Sorry about that. No problem. I'm a computer dork, so don't worry about me. That's all right. You can close this pop-up here, the co-pilot. I think we opened that on accident. So just hit the X at the top right of this co-pilot pop-up window. X at the right of the co-pilot. I'm a dork with computers, so you're going to have to help me here. Oh, yeah, no problem. So you see where it says good morning, Renee, in that pop-up window? No. it says Renee, you, Greg, or Garrett oh okay I'm seeing something different at the bottom of your screen with those icons again click on the one to the left of Google yeah click on that does that show you the good morning Renee screen that I'm seeing oh there we go no it's not popping up for me All right. Okay, there we go. You see that? Okay, you can close that. I think that's what we opened accidentally. There's an X at the top right of that window. Jesus Lord. Which window? It's not letting me do it. Are you looking at my screen? Yeah, I'm seeing on your screen it says, good morning, Renee. What can I help you with today? Right, but it's, oh, there we go. Close that. Okay, I closed it. Perfect. Okay, then go back down to the Google Chrome icon. at the bottom and click on that little pop-up that appears right above it. That little white box, yeah, if you click on that, it should open up Google Chrome. It's not opening up anything on my end. Okay, try clicking that again and then clicking on that white box right there, yeah. Yeah, nothing seems to be opening. Do you have multiple screens or multiple monitors? I have two. I have two monitors. Okay. Is Google Chrome opening on maybe a different monitor when you click on that icon? Oh, here. RingCentral join the meeting. PCR help desk. My screen is just really screwed up here. Okay, so it looks like it's showing on the screen that I can't see. Are you able to drag all that over to the screen that I'm looking at? I'm trying to. Okay. It's over here on my – can you see? No, I'm still just seeing the desktop background. I guess drag that back to the initial screen it was on and maybe it'll appear there. So, yeah, I'm seeing there it is. Now I can see the RingCentral meeting. OK, expand that and then go ahead and open PCR in your bookmarks there. PCR is open. Okay, I'm seeing on the screen it says RingCentral at the top left. Are you seeing that logo? There we go. Yeah, I'm just going to open it up on the screen. Okay. Perfect. All right, and then go to PCR mail by clicking on the gear icon at the top right, going to email. Excellent. Okay, I can see that. All right, so let's try that again. go to the three dots at the top right of your browser, go down to more tools, developer tools, awesome. Okay and we can ignore all that that popped up there. Then up on your web address where it goes www dot to the left of that right click on the refresh button. Refresh. And then go to empty cache. Yeah there you go. So that'll slowly refresh the page and reload everything. thing. Once that completes, we can close those developer tools. Awesome. Okay, go ahead and try to delete or send or any of the actions you were having trouble with before. Now it's doing it. Awesome. Okay, praise God. You just need to clear that cache. Yeah, no problem. Honey, thank you. I'm so terribly sorry. Let's see if it works now. Let me just... I'm going to my actual screen that I'm on. Okay. No, it's not deleting now. It looks like the screen that you have open, something's wrong with it. There's something corrupted, so I would completely close out of that and use the screen that we were just on where it was working. My screen's been fine for years. I know. I just think the current screen you have open has some problem that occurred on the browser. So you have it open twice, it sounds like, and one of those instances needs to be closed, the one that's not working, and then you can use the one that is working. Okay, let me see here. I'm going to – okay. I just – okay. It's all working now. I just – I dragged the screen over to the other – to my main screen, and it's working now. Well, sweetheart, thank you, Mr. Garrett. No problem. Happy to help. Anything else? Have a great weekend. I appreciate your help. Okay, awesome. Reach out if you need anything else. I will. Thank you, sir.",
