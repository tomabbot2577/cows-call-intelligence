    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, hey, it's Scott Bailey at Ocean. How's it going, Scott? It's going good, Matt. How are you doing? Not too bad, not too bad. I ran into an error message I've never seen before, and I'm wondering how I can get around it. It says, I was trying to do a Boolean search and using the not qualifier, right? And it says error. Cannot perform a not Boolean search without any other criteria. What I had done was to create a rollup and then just simply in the keyword search typed in not this value. you. And although I got a number, you know, it brought the roll-up number down by a couple of hundred. It said error, you don't do that, can't do that. Did it still work anyway, or can I ignore that? Or how do you feel about that? So typically you have to say, like, it is something but not this for the logic to work correctly. So if it does give you results, They may not be correct results. So what what exactly are you trying to. Because you could always do the not like. What kind of search are you like keyword search are you doing? Well, so the answer is a complex one. And what I've discovered is that I was jacking Lucene around. And so it was suggested that I break the search down into components or pieces. and I felt to get really good answers, to get a really good result, would be to take it even down to separating out the nots. But I get your point, right? Even though it produced an answer, it may not be an accurate answer. So I can actually fold the not back into a previous qualifier, right? For example, R&D, N-Bay, not Prog or Prog and be done with it. But I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to mess her up again with the and and the or and the not. That's what I was told before was just too much. Yeah, so as long as you break it down a little bit, you'll be fine. You just don't want to use that not by itself. No, Jake. All right, very good. Okay, cool. I'll run with that. I just wanted to make sure I was getting good advice. I appreciate it. Thank you. Yep, not a problem. You have a good one. All right, see you, Ty. See you, bye. Bye-bye.",
