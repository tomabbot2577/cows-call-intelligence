    "text": " Hello? Hi. Hi, Robin. How are you? I'm not too bad, and you? I'm doing an RFI for someone. An RFI? Basically, they send you a whole bunch. Yep, they send you a whole bunch of questions, and you answer them. Oh, I think I had one of those come over once, and it was like, oh, my God. It was like crazy questions. This one's not too crazy. And I demoed him this morning. He said, could you fill out my form? I said I can fill out your form. Ah, good. Anyway, this thing for Tino. Do you have anything done or no? No, I haven't. I just say we send it with no hours. Yeah, and then let that be his problem. I'm sure that he's charging him because I know Tino. He's going to make money. He's going to bill them separately so he can pocket that money because he'll do all the training most likely. Will you do the two forms then for me, the two contracts, or walk me through how to do it? We need a contract and then a release to transfer, right? Sounds like it, yeah. Yeah. Or do you want to walk me through how to do it? I created the name. Ellen, stop yelling at me. Such an asshole. Such an asshole. um yeah it's a bit to do are you okay oh there's a duplicate feature there is select this option to make a copy of this document I wonder what it would do and I just want to replace it well that's normally what you do anyway are Are you in Panda right now? You did one for WaveCross. Yeah, I think four today. Oh. Should I try duplicate and see what happens? No, what I usually do, if you have the record open, I can kind of walk you through how to create the contract. Okay. All right, so I'm going to go to new document, and then say templates customer no no no no what I do is I go I usually go home and then I go create a document yeah but create document and then so I've got standard agreement no conversion right yes standard agreement no conversion Exactly. Okay. Give it a name. And I always do company name, PC recruiter premium, or whatever. Enterprise agreement. I don't remember what they're getting. Tendergrass premium agreement. And then PC recruiter. Well, they get analytic sequencing, PCR mail, contract temp. That would be premium. 100 bucks a month, right? Yeah, that's premium. Okay, they've got it. So I usually make it like Pendergrass Associates, PC recruiter premium agreement, 2025. 25. Okay. Because then it's all, and then when you upload the attachment, all the information is right in the title. So it's good. Okay. Add recipient. I already did. What was his name? David Marin. Okay. Did that. Add recipient of me? Yeah. If you're, you'll get it back and then you'll be the signer. Mine only defaults to me. Or if you want to make it Bill or me. Bill is the same. Okay. I'm just a recipient. Okay. Continue. That way I know when it's signed. continue. Okay. Now, okay. I filled in prepared for David Marin Tendergrass created by sender first name last name. So you want to put in your, and you click in that little yellow box and it's going to pop up a little like little window. Oh, so I put whose name should I put there? Bill? Yeah, Bill. I put me, but I think you're logged in under Bill, so I'll put Bill. Okay. And then prepared for, make sure you put in their company name. Okay. I must pick that up. Okay. recipient will see this block. Choose a different value. Item 2. Pro license, enter size. Oh, okay. Premium one year. Oh, click in the yellow box. Yep. Premium one year. Pick that, and that's going to add all that crap there. Okay. And do you have up in the usage, up in that title page, Do you have their name and their companies filled in? And then Bill's name and PC Recruiter? Mm-hmm. Perfect. So that's done. You pick the premium package. Then you have to put in a date. Put today's date? Mm-hmm. You can click in there. It'll double-click. It'll make us select there. And then you throw in company name and address. Oh. We should probably be changing the address on here. 4420 Sherwin Road, Hamilton Hall, Willoughby, Ohio We should, yeah, we've never done it But we should, I think What is it, P.O. Box 805? Is it 805? I have to look into it Yeah, Marty had it in his email too And I don't remember what it was I'm going to look at somebody's invoice I think it's 805 I always forget, is it 805? 850 805 will be Ohio 4409 floor okay and company name and what you want to do is definitely click in that little box because that'll put it into every company name field in the whole document so from there put it in their company address and what I usually do is I paste in that company address field I will paste in their street address and then I outside of the box put their city state zip underneath to keep it three lines oh I just did well he's got in his thing it's got a break in between so yeah it's fine I just yeah I want my better yeah I stylized it that way but it's no biggie and it should have I filled in every company name field so that should now be filled out all through there and then toward the bottom I do notice okay I gotta change this to 8 PO box 805 oh yeah we got to change that on template we haven't even gotten to it or thought about it. And so it's Grouch and Kubitschok. Okay. I think technically she's not the CFO anymore, but I haven't worried about that either. Start date. Start date is I put today and then terminate on what is it a year contract? I would assume so. Okay, I guess so. Okay, so today was the 8th. August 12th. Oh, do we spell it out there? No, I just said 8-12-2025. I just put 8-12. 8-12-2025 and then it'll expire 8-11-2026 right because a new one would pick up on 8-12. okay then once you're done there now you're done with that part you're going to scroll down beyond the signature pieces beyond those then you have to put in training hours under schedule one which we're going to put zero so inclusive hours okay zero hours and then you throw in the setup fee click in the yellow box and type it in. Subtotal initial fees or? Yeah. Yeah, subtotal initial fee, that's the setup. Okay, so that's $250. And then you put in the next one down, the price per user, and then you put in quantity of users. price per user is 100 quantity to based on a and I click in that orange box and put one year or 12 months either one Oh. And then sometimes I drag it to center it on the A. Yeah, I don't like... Oh, shit. I don't like how this is formatting. Let me drag you, dude. It's fussy. You can drag it. Okay. finally got it to work. I think I'm going to click out of the box and then underneath it says premium package premium license package one year so that's already set. Okay. That's what that because if you do it removes the whole page up top so if you ever have to change that to like two year just delete the whole thing and manually type it in because if you change it in the little yellow box there it overrides that little second page that showed up above the list. Okay so one year it's based on two years so then that totals 200. So enter values 200. Minimum storage of units exclusive. And yeah what we do with those is the very first one I click on the orange box and hit the little trash can because number of storage units inclusive of a bank so I always leave a blank so I hit the trash can to take out the first orange box and then the next two I just put zero dot zero zero because there's no data for the search fees right now. Okay. And then you'll want to put in total initial fees. You'll want to type in the set of fees I think carries over. You'll want to type in your user fees, zero for the data fees, and manually total it. Okay. So monthly user fees, 200. Monthly data fees, nothing. And then, so this should be $450 as the opening balance. Yep. And now that's done. So then you go up to the send up in the upper kind of right-hand corner. Okay. Hold on one second. I'm going to change P.O. Box 805. Okay. Got it. Send. Email text. Yep. You can type a little note in there. You don't have to, but sometimes I'll just put in, hey, this is your PC recruiter agreement. Let me know if you have any questions or anything like that. then when you send it it should send out okay and now that should be good I say peace recruiter agreement one-year agreement initiated by Tina Langer or something like that yeah requested by Tina Langer something like that just so he might la ng ner right la lang or yeah la ng ner This is your one-year peace recruiter agreement as requested by Tino Langer. Please review and sign to begin the process. Okay. Okay. Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do. So once that's signed. Now will you do the one about the data sign off? Yeah, I will do it right now because I have, I think I'm going to take one here and just kind of make a copy of it. Just duplicate. Yeah, because I just, like I've done this before, but since it's DocuSignable, it's nice. I just put in like, I so and so authorized transfer of the complete database named X from this company to that company, I put a signature page and a date. So. I'm gonna go ahead. I'm going to go ahead and go to contracts and agreements and do at least start with the standard one premium standard agreement no conversion do you want me to create it in here and I could send it over you want me to see if I can create it have you send it over yeah we don't create it I guess yeah let me try and create it because we don't sign it only they need to sign it so that's all good so let me see if I can create a new one. P.O. Box 805. I'm going to replace this here. I don't know who that is. I am not doing it. There was one place. There was one place. And this is, who is this that's getting this? Let me look at it. Isn't it Judy Walcott? Yes. WorkLink is the company name. Okay, so WorkLink. So I'm going to put in... WorkLink Group. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I don't want to do that yet. Okay. So if I go in and just modify this, am I, is there a save option? Judy Walcott, she's in here already. Judy Walcott. Continue. Okay. So let's go through here. Oh the tender grass database okay. Copy yes it's one database on Herodibc it looks like. Thank you. And two, what's the guy's name going to be? Two, David Marin. Okay, and then we need a signature field. Pop that right there, make it a little bigger. A date field, pop that right there. So I, Judy Walcott, authorized the transfer of the complete database named Tendergrass from the WorkLink Group PC Recruiter account ASP site blah, blah, blah to David Marin of Tendergrass. Okay. And you know what I'm going to do? I've created it. I think I'm just going to send it, but CCU. Okay. I'll include you on it. So we'll do this. Yeah, if you send it, if you add her because there's one signature, I can think the other one just sends me like so I see it. and then that way when she completes it I get notified too I believe yeah I'll throw myself in there too just so I see so I've got you okay working Adam hello Judy here is what is this the needed sign off in order to transfer a copy of the tender grass database from your BC recruiter accounts to that of David Marin okay so I've got that okay I'm gonna send it so you should have it and then you should be able to even see what I created so you if you ever need to do it again that that's kind of the pattern of what I have created okay sounds good but that is her so that is done all right cool thank you sir anytime Robin the invoice part I know how to do so that part's fun yeah sure yeah alright I got the work group okay okay thanks Robin talk to you soon alrighty thanks bye bye",
