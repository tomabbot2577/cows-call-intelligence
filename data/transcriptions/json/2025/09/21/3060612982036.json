    "text": " Hello? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received your voicemail that you were having trouble in PCR. Yeah, so it's weird. After you and I talked and we fixed it, I did a roll-up. And it appears that some in the roll-up recorded and some didn't. Okay. And I can't see why. First, I'm out going email. Okay, let's see. I'm going to check. I'm going to log in as you and your database or I'll just do all. This month. Oh, this is strange. It is not showing any sent email campaigns for some reason. What does that mean? Like, so it's saying that I haven't done any emails or? Oh, no, sorry. OK, yeah. Email campaigns isn't turned on for your account. There was a an older feature for just bulk emailing. And that's what comes up when I try to bulk email rather than email campaigns, which you can actually see like open clicks and replies and things. So never mind. What was the roll-up that you sent to? Is it still in the database? Yeah. I should have taken note of specifically which person it was. I did like a random lookup. I think it was – here, let me see if I can find it quickly. Okay. Yeah, I'll just check on a couple name records and see what's going on. So it was, I'm going to listen to Linda and I got to find her again. Sorry, give me one second. No problem. Okay, here's one. Her name is Brianna Combs. And it looks like you can see the rollup was 8-19 at 11-47. Okay. So they were added to the rollup called – oh, it's called blank. Okay. I see that. And then she didn't get recorded. Okay. I'll go to activities. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. Okay. And when did you send the email out to Brianna? Do you know a time? The 19th. Let me look her up again. Let's see, because I can... What do you think? 7 p.m. Yeah, I see that in your sent mail, B. Combs at Plunkett T. Cooney. No, not Plunkett T. Cooney. it's um oh it is sorry I take that back it is pumpkin got it okay so yeah I see that in your sent mail and then activities it's not listed there and then if I go to the email it is showing up in your emails tab on the Brianna Combs record just not an What do you mean in my email tab? So if you open up the Brianna Combs name record, there's an emails tab. So it is mapping that it was a sent. Okay. Yeah, I guess when the other recruiters are not going to look at the emails, that's a problem. Right. It should be recording an activity. Let me see here. Preferences, activities, right. Outgoing email activities, yes. Okay, check one other thing here. Okay, and you have for your username, it's turned on to auto-write activities when bulk emailing letters. Okay, so that's already been turned on, that's good. Yeah, I'm not sure why the activity wasn't written. It is connecting with that emails tab, but the emails tab specifically is gonna only show you what your username has sent or received from that person. So even if another team member clicked on the emails tab, it would show a different list of emails. It would be their username's correspondence. So that's not helpful for other users trying to look. But yeah, we really needed to appear in activities. Oh, let me see. No, okay, that's import. I was like, oh, I just saw an 819 activity. Just the word import. Okay, I will, I guess I'll have a tech team member take a look. I'm not exactly sure. But yeah, the emails are going out. They're being recorded as going out in your emails tab, just an activities problem. So I'm not sure what would be causing that. Everything looks set up correctly for your username. I just double checked everything we went over kind of on our last call and everything looks good. So, yeah, let me just get back to you. I'll open up a new ticket and get back to you after I let the tech team take a look. Okay. Yeah, because it's a big issue because more than one person is working on this and they can't see what I've done and I don't have time to go and do each and every one. So I really need to evolve quickly if you can. All right. Yep. I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from the tech team. Now, since I've got you on the phone, can I ask you one other question? Sure. Is there a way you can use PCR capture through LinkedIn? Yeah, the capture tool is built to work with LinkedIn. Absolutely. You would basically just open up the LinkedIn profile and there would be a click to add button that appears on the right and you could capture that person. And that has to be done through phone. It can't be done on Safari or any others. Right. Right. It's only compatible with Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Okay, so can you hold on one second? I'm just going to jump into Chrome because I never use Chrome. I don't even know, actually. I'm pretty sure I got it set up. So if I jump into LinkedIn from Chrome, you're saying that something will show up. If you installed the Chrome browser extension, the PCR capture browser extension, you'll have to install it and then log into it. So it connects to your database and your username and then you'll be able to. I believe I did that because I did I did look it up and I tried to follow what the directions were. But I'm still. Give me one second, I'm just going to log in to LinkedIn. Right. That's what I need to do. Log into LinkedIn. And then, okay, so. Sorry, I never use Chrome, so I just got to look up my passwords. Okay. I don't know. all my passwords are saved on the other browser. I see. It would be kind of a pain to use it, but I don't know that I have a choice. One second. Okay. And then it keeps saying, check your LinkedIn. Do I have to sign into Chrome for it to work too? I don't think so. You don't have to be signed into Chrome. Okay. Okay, so. Oh, well, at least not for the capture tool. I'm not sure if LinkedIn has any requirements with that. Now it's making me go LinkedIn on my app. I'm sorry. Give me one second. I don't know why it's so difficult to log in. I just I did it and it just isn't working that's why I kind of want to ask you yeah we can jump on a screen share too and take a look at using that capture tool I just won't log me in I don't understand why keep saying we sent a notification to your LinkedIn in which I'm in my LinkedIn app and I'm not having any issues but it says it's supposed to um it's logging in just fine so what is the issue okay there are two songs Okay, I'm finally in LinkedIn. Now you're saying there's something on the right, right? Yeah, if you open up a LinkedIn profile, there'll be a click to add button that appears halfway down the screen on the right. Okay, hold on. Let me open up somebody's profile. Okay, so I'm in the profile. And then what will I see on the right? the LinkedIn? It'll be a PCR capture logo. It'll say click to add about halfway down the screen. Awesome. Yeah, you just click on that and you can capture the person into your database. What do I do then? I just have to put them in the field name? Is that what it is? It says select duplicates to update merge. So that's to put them into the system, right? it? So yeah, what you're seeing on the first... If I haven't done a roll-up, like if they're not in the system already, can I still do it? Or do they have to be in the system? No, yeah, they don't have to be in the system. People use this to put new people into the system. You capture them off of LinkedIn and make them a name record in your database. So the screen you just described is the first screen of the capture tool. It's letting you know if there's a duplicate in the database so you don't create a second one. You just update. Up on the top frame, it'll show you if there's any name records that it found as a possible match. And in the bottom frame, it'll show you any company records that are possible to match. Is it listing any names up top, or is it just listing companies? It's not. It says select duplicates to update merge, but then there's no name. But then at the bottom, it says, again, select duplicates to update merge, and then there is a name. Do you want me to pick one that doesn't have a name so it's a little easier? No, this will be fine. So in this instance, you don't have the name record already in your database, but it's telling you you do have the company already in your database. So in the bottom frame, just check the box to the right of the company so that this person gets added to the company record in your database. Check the box to the right. Yeah, if you hover over the company that's listed down there at the bottom frame, the match that I found, there's a little checkbox on the right that you can click. We could jump on a screen share if that helps as well. Yeah, you know what, let me just try somebody else. Maybe this is, she's one of the recruiters, maybe that's part of the problem. Let me just do one that I'm sure is not in there. Okay. Let's find one here. Okay, Melissa Stubbs at Naples State Law. Let's hope they have a LinkedIn. Okay, yeah, there we go. Okay, so I found this person, and I'm in Chrome, and there's – okay, so click to add. Okay, so it does, at the top, it automatically put in Melissa Stubbs, Associate Attorney. It didn't put the contact information, but it did put location. And then in there, I can actually add the activity, too? Oh, no, you wouldn't be, yeah, there wouldn't be any activity that you need to add. it'll manually create an activity that you're creating a record and all that as you... So I just press submit and then it'll automatically go through? What's the company that's listed in the bottom frame? Wilson and Jones or something? So is that the right... I think so, yeah. Let me just go look and see. It will be creating a company record in your database if Wilson and Jones doesn't already exist is what will happen there. What about the name? It will create a name record and a company. It creates both. So every name record has to go to some company record. So that's what we saw in that first example. It was saying, as you're bringing this name in, what company do you want them to be in? We found a match in your database. So you would say, oh, yeah, that company in my database already is where I wanted that first person to go. And then you capture them. This person, there's not a matching name or a matching company in your database. So you're creating those. Yeah. OK, perfect. So now I'm looking at her and it says. Profile was completed, captured LinkedIn profile. So does that mean that I actually reached out to them? Is that what captured LinkedIn profile means? No, it would just be that they've been captured into your database. the person will have no indication that you've captured them. I thought you said it automatically adds the activity. Yeah, it'll add the activity. that you've created a new record in the database? Oh, so I still need to go into the activity section and say that I emailed this person regarding whatever role. Yeah, I mean, as you email somebody, that'll automatically get recorded. And that's just the issue we're experiencing currently with your account where I'm going to contact the tech team where you do send out emails and an automatic activity should be written. And so, yeah, the capture tool is just a way to grab somebody from LinkedIn, get them in your database. You'll still have to do all your other actions of like emailing them and things like that. And activity should automatically be written as all that happens. I see. OK, perfect. OK. That makes sense. So like even just right now, I just went into that Melissa Stubbs one. and I went into activities and I added emails regarding PAFT. But I'm looking right now and I don't even see that. Okay, let me see. You said it was Melissa. It's S-P-U-B-B-S. Okay. Let me go to activities. Hmm. Yeah, I'm not seeing any activity there. Let me... I literally just did it. It's so weird. Okay, I'm going to try to sign in as your username and try to save an activity on a record to make sure that that's still working there. Let me just log in to Ascend. Oh, now it just came up. It just came up. Oh, okay. I don't know why. So it's just there's a delay or something? Yeah, it could be a delay with certain automatic activities, but if you manually edit it, it should go there automatically. Let's see. Okay, so I'm just going to my own name record, Garrett Camiotti, in your database. I'm signed in as your username. I just want to add an activity really quick here and make sure that it appears. Add activity. Save test. Save. And I'll go to my activities. Yeah, there it is. Okay. So it is working when I save a new activity on a record. Let me send myself an email real quick. PCR support test. Go to email. and that recorded an outgoing email automatically. Okay, so it does seem to be working. I think something's weird with that bulk email you sent. It didn't record those activities. So I'm going to have to, yeah, like I said, have the tech team take a look. It looks like everything else is working. It made an email activity when I emailed myself, and when I added my own just manual activity, it wrote that as well. Okay. Okay. Awesome. Can you put an urgency on it, possibly? Yeah, absolutely. Okay, great. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. No problem. I'll reach back out soon as soon as I hear from the tech team. Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",
