    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Oh, hey, Garrett. This is Dirk at Sun Valley Search. I actually just shot you an email while I was calling in. Hey, I've got a quick question on the search. Do you have just a minute? Sure. Okay. I'm wondering how I could search to see who I sent emails to through the database on a certain day and populate that list. Sure. So that would be an activity search. So you'll want to go to activities in the main menu at the top of PCR. My PCR company name position roll-up system. Yeah, if you click the three horizontal lines at the end of that main menu, you'll get more and activities should be an option. Got it. Okay, perfect. Yep. So that's activity search and you're going to keep it at name at the top left where you can choose between company name, position, interview. And then there's a heading called search params where you can put in a date range. Yep. And enter that. And then below that are filters. And you're going to want to use the filter called activity type. And was this like a bulk email or just a single email? It was a bulk email. Okay. In the activity type, type in the word bulk email, all caps, no spaces. that's going to be the actual way the system writes that activity type. Okay. And then hit the – yeah, so both, you know, and then – I'm sorry. I actually have a call that I've been waiting on. Oh, no, no problem. Just call back. Let me figure it out from here, and I'll let you know. All right. Sounds good. I so appreciate it.",
