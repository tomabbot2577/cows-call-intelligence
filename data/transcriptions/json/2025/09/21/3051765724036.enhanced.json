I know we worked on getting the bulk email set up for one of the employees. I want to know, are we able to do the same thing with the admin account? So can the admin have access to send out bulk emails as well? Yeah, let me pop into your account here. Take a look. So what's the email address that you'd be using for the admin account? It would be Heather at. So let me take a look here. Do you still have that API key saved that we copied before? Okay. If you send me that API key and the email address, I can set it up here for you real quick. I saved it but it's not I'm not sure it's not Did I send it to you once before? Let me see. Yeah, I'm checking up my end here too. I saved it, but it's saved as API key dot msg, and it's asking me to select a file to open it. You could just do like notepad if it gives you that option. Let me see. Yeah, it's giving me a bunch of mumbo jumbo here. Let me see if I can find it here. Let me see if this will work. You said it's just under the admin account? Yeah. And you said it's... Name's Heather? Yeah. What's Heather's last name? Shapiro. Thank you. Just one second here. Just double checking that this is working. Oh, I got the AP. I got it. All right, perfect.
