    "text": " Hello, this is Neil. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a voicemail here that you are having trouble with PCR? Yeah, not so much trouble, but trouble trying to figure out how to change stages and roll-ups, specifically for names roll-ups. Okay. Bear with me a second. Sure. All right. Go ahead. I'm in now. Awesome. So there's two types of stages you can have. You can have the stages related to just your username or global rollup stages that were made in the system menu. And each rollup can be assigned either your individual username stages or those global ones. So it depends on which rollup you're in, which set of stages are available to you there. All right. This is good to know because in the past, each individual user, I've had to do like a screenshot of what my stages look like and then they create their own. So it sounds like there's a way to do those across the organization through global. And then whenever we create the roll up, it's assigned a global roll up. Exactly. And that's used for teams where maybe an admin just creates those stages once up in the system menu. and then it'll be uniform for all the users. Yes, these roll-ups, I want to use that global set of stages. Yeah, that's exactly what we want to do. Oh, cool. Okay, I can show you that. So if you go to System in the main menu up at the top, and then on the left, look for Database Setup, about the sixth or seventh option down. Got it. And then on the right there, kind of lower down, it says roll-up list global stage setup. Got it. That will open up your global templates here, and you can build your set of stages. Is this for a names roll-up? Oh, it does look like it's for names. But I can also do one for positions, right? Right. Got it. All right. So I'll go back in and do a separate one for positions. That'll make sense. Yeah. And so, yeah, build it out the same way you would any other way. At the top left, it says, it'll probably say default in a dropdown. That's showing you the current template you're editing. But you can add more templates with the plus sign kind of at the top left there. so that when people are creating their roll-up, they could say, yes, I want to use the global roll-ups, and let me choose which set of stages that I want for this roll-up. So you can make maybe a set of stages for marketing or maybe one for recruiting. So totally up to you how many you want to add. Yeah, this is just going to be for recruiting off of names roll-ups. So the stages we've used in the past, stage one is that, you know, we've tried them once, like a voicemail, email, text, or, you know, stage two is we've tried them twice. Stage three is phone tags. Stage four is folk need to follow up and so on. So I'll create those now. And then for positions, what we do is we have a roll up called hot sheet. And these are all the positions that we're either working on or might be about to work on. So it would be, you know, we've sent them our introductory recruiting packet, stage one. Stage two is we're waiting on a signed fee agreement. Stage three is it's an active search. Stage four is, you know, we've got candidates that we're submitting. Stage five is candidates interviewing and so on. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. So I would recommend building these in the back end. Go ahead. Say again. Yeah, so I'd recommend building those stages out here in the back end. Just make sure you toggle on up at the top that says enable global rollup stages so that that will be available for people to choose when they're creating a rollup. And I guess I'll require it. Yeah, you can require it as well. That means people can only choose from your global stages you've made rather than use their own usernames stages. Yep, and I'm going to do that too. Now, for existing roll-ups, will this change them or will they remain as they are? It's only for new roll-ups that we create. So this will be only for new roll-ups, but if you have a roll-up where nobody's moved to a stage yet, so it all just says, you know, click to set stage, you could edit that roll-up and choose the global stages. But once somebody's moved to a stage, that roll-up's just kind of set in stone with those stages, if that makes sense. Got it. So I'll just tell my team from now on, when you create a new roll up, you're going to be required to use the global roll up stages. Right. And if you do make multiple templates there, there's one, the one that you would be editing now is just called default. But like we said, you can click the plus sign to add a different set of stages. they will have that drop down when they're creating the roll-up to say I want my default set of stages or I want the one you made for business development or something like that so yeah that's what they'll see when they make the roll-up okay all right this is good um I don't think we're going to do the default the default activity type oh go ahead the default the right activity I wish there was a way that we could write a note but you know we use notes instead of activities oh so the default activity would be oh okay Yeah, so you have that column called write activity. If you choose default activity there in that column, it'll look to the left, the default activity type column, and automatically write that activity you selected in that dropdown. Oh. I see. Okay. All right. Let me just play with this. If I have any more questions, I'll circle back. But this is exactly what I was looking for. And actually, I didn't realize that we could share it through this global feature. So that's great. Awesome. Yeah. I'll actually, maybe I'll send you, let me see, do I have your email address? I can send you a quick email with a link to our learning center. We have an article about this that might be helpful to reference as well. I have neil at brooksmarinegroup.com. Yep. That's it. Awesome. Yeah, I'll send that your way and just reach out if you have any questions. All right. Thanks for the help. Much appreciated. All right. Have a good one. You too. Bye.",
