    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, my name is Sandy Brown, and I'm calling from EASER Technical Solutions regarding our billing. Okay. We always had this automatically taken off of our credit card or put onto our credit card every month. And then around April, well, let me backtrack. So last year and since this January, it was always taken out on the 15th through March. And then there was nothing in April charged. And then the one in May was taken out on the 7th. And now there hasn't been one for June. Okay. So let me see what's going on. So, yeah, so we did switch billing systems because how it was done was, we'll just say, really bad for the number of customers that we have and accurate tracking and everything. Okay. Yeah. So. I think the owner of the company gets all the emails. I don't get them on my end. So he probably got it and just forwarded it to me. So what happened is, yeah, they go to rob at eservtech.net. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So what happened is we kind of had you set up what's called like a sales receipt, which is like basically walking up and saying, hey, give me a receipt. and then you try to process the card, not very good because the system kind of really didn't have like an auto pay apparently. So it was kind of like a workaround. So what we did when we switched to our new invoice system is we do where we send you an invoice and then you would just have to put in your card details to sign up for auto pay. Now let me take a look at this because one of these actually already has a late fee charged. Hold on one second. Well, and I paid that yesterday through our bank. So I just paid that for a bank. Okay. Because what you can do, there's a billing portal. So there are three open invoices. One was just sent yesterday. And then there was one for, yeah, so the date of 4-18, that was only because we were in that process of the switch. Normally you're billed on the 15th of the month. That one was a little off because that's when we were kind of switching everything over. Okay, and I didn't see that come out on the credit card on the 18th either. So that one, because it wasn't, so your last one that kind of was an auto pay was March 15th. And then what was on May 7th? May 7th was the payment made for the April 18th invoice. Okay. So it wasn't done in auto pay, but somebody went into the invoice and actually paid it, or somehow that one got paid. Okay. But it wasn't done until later. Okay. Now, so how did you pay these? So how many did you pay, the three of them? The three already were January, February, and March were just automatically taken out. Okay. That was before. Yeah. I just paid the one that was by 15. Okay. And how did you do that? I did it through our bank. Okay, so do you do like a check or something that's going to be sent to us? Yeah, they'll send you a check. I didn't see on the invoice anywhere how I could go online and pay it. So at the bottom of each invoice, there's like a view and pay option if you want to use a card. Okay, see, that doesn't show on the invoice that he sent me. Oh, maybe he just sent you the attachment. Is it somewhere in the body of the email? Probably, yeah. Would you be able to ask me? Sure. She gets these emails. Okay. Let's see. She's answering a little bit. It's a man thing, right? I'm just kidding. It's a man thing. And we don't, I live in Georgia. He was asking, so. Okay, so let's see here. Let me go over this way. A.S.E.R.V. Why doesn't it like that? Just in here. Okay. Oops, I got to log in and log out apparently. How did you switch over? Oh, it was madness for a while because everyone's like, why am I getting an invoice? So there's a lot of questions, but it's going much smoother now because you can actually like there's like a portal link where you can actually sign up with like the primary email that's used for billing and you can actually go in and see your invoices you can change your card like you can manage your card rather than calling us saying oh I changed my card so it's a lot easier but the beginning to do that um I put my email on or not because you said I think it would have to be created as Rob because that's the primary email now what is your email address it's s as a sandy brown b-r-o-n-n at usurptech.net i don't know i have you even in here i'm gonna even put you in here okay so i'm so sorry so it's sandy or sandra it's just s brown s brown i'm gonna make like basically like a name record in our pcr database for you So again, what was your full first name and last name? Sandy. Sandy. Sandy Brown. And then B-R-O-N-N. O-N-N. Okay. Making sure. And then so that's sbrown at eservtech.net? Yes. Okay. All right. So what I can do is add you as like a copied recipient, but the primary email is Rob's okay put his name here and just to make sure of everything right for you let's see and your two users, right? Yeah. Okay. Now, do you need those open invoices resent to you so you can see within the body? Yeah, that would be great. Okay. It's a key forward menu on July 15th. But it's even forward menu. Is that for June then when it's dated July 15th? So basically whatever the date is for the services for that upcoming month. So your invoice because you pay upfront for the month so your 515 was like basically from 515 up to 615 your 615 invoice is for up to 715. Okay yeah you send me the one for June then so I will leave that. Okay so you need the June one I'm going to send that over to you now. and then do you need the July one that would have sent yesterday? No, that's the one he sent me. I think he wasn't even really looking at the dates. He just thought maybe they were all the same. Yeah. So do you need the May one? Because that one's still open. You could send that. It's been paid, though. Has it been paid, May? Well, if you sent, like, a check and stuff, I don't see it as paid yet. Okay. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I did that one that has the check. And through the bank, it'll take like four or five days, hopefully. Okay. Okay, so you just needed the one, correct? Yes. Okay. All right. Those are now over to you then. And then in the future, they'll be sent to me as well. Oh, I can get them. Happy going forward. All right. That cleared everything up. Thank you. You are so welcome. Have a great week. Okay. Yeah, thank you. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye. Wow.",
