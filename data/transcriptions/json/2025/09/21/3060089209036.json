    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi. I am trying to use PC Recruiter, and it is just extremely slow. Nothing is loading. It's not saving notes. So I just want to see what's going on there. Yeah. Let me try logging in on my end, see if it's an issue on our end or maybe computer specific. What is your username? It's happening to me and my two other coworkers also. Gotcha. So what's your username to log into PCR? Good question. I think it's just Victoria. Yeah, it's just Victoria. Okay. Let's try that. Okay. And are there any specific actions inside of PCR that are slow? Is it just, so you said saving notes is probably one of them. Yeah. I mean, it's everything. Everything is slow when I try to click on a candidate, when I try to click on a company, a position, notes, save intake form, everything. I'm seeing that as well. Yep. Okay, cool. on our end that I'm seeing that as well. So it might be an issue with our server. Let me create a ticket and escalate that up to our tech team.
