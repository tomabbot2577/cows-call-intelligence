    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Giselle with the Newport Group. How are you? Good. How are you? Not too bad, thanks. I just have a couple of questions. So we just recently hired an offshore data entry person for us. And she what I did was I gave her the login for our admin account. So that way she could also she also has access to like changing the recruiter for like names and companies are being added or that needs updating. And so we're kind of sharing. Will that like cause any issues at all? It's like two people are on the same account at the same time. I shouldn't. You just might see things update weirdly if you're both. at the same time in both update and records right gotcha um and another thing is when she just showed this to me but like whenever she would um update something or like right now she's adding a company onto pcr and she's entering the industry selection and it shows like a pop-up pcr recruiter was inactive and automatically logged out after 480 minutes but she hasn't like she's been using it pretty much like every minute. Is she using a VPN? Maybe. Could that be why? Yeah, because PC Recruiter requires a static IP address. Oh, okay. So if she has either, like if her provider has a dynamic address. Yeah, I think it is. Yeah. so anytime that ip address changes it logs you out for security purposes because it says hey this is a new ip it might not be the same person we have to verify it's the same person gotcha is there a way to so i do think she is she does have a dynamic ip address um because she just logged out and i had to like re-enter the new ip address into the system how can we work around that. So the easiest way, especially if it's just like the same few IPs that it's changing from, you can always whitelist. Gotcha. I think that's what I did. Yeah, I would copy the IP address and then just add it into the security settings. Other than that, she may want to contact her provider and request a static IP. Right. Okay. Gotcha. Because there's no way to just turn that off. Yeah. Okay. How do IP addresses change? Do they change when you... What do you call this? Do they just randomly change throughout the day? Yep. So not even if she turned her Wi-Fi off or something like that and tried to turn it back on? Yeah, it's just kind of random. They do it, there's usually like a, or usually if it's like her provider that has the dynamic IP address, it's a little bit easier than VPNs because VPNs will bounce all over the place. If it's her provider, they might be able to give her a list of the dynamic IPs. Gotcha. And then I can just enter all that in. Yep. Gotcha. All right. All right. I'll ask her if she does that, if she is using a VPN. Um, and yeah, so if, yeah, what would, what can we do if she is using a VPN? No, not use it while you're working in PC recruiter. Yeah, that's true. Okay. All right. Um, okay. I will let her know. And then, yeah, we can, we'll just figure that out then. Thank you. That'll be all. Yep. Not a problem. You have yourself a great day and a great weekend. Thank you to have a great weekend. Bye. Bye.",
