    "text": " Hey, good morning, Robin. It's Steve Monson with the Monson Group. Hi, how are you? I'm doing okay. How are you? Oh, pretty good. I'll give you a heads up. I have a call scheduled to start in about four minutes. Oh, okay. So I might have to schedule something for a little bit later. All right, I will be quick. I see I was in the template. I didn't realize I had to be in overview. Yeah. So like with the templates, like your templates always your starting point and then you could activate it, you know, five times. Once it's activated, it's really separate. Like you could go in and edit one sequence and keep the other as is. You can even delete that template. So changing a template doesn't change a sequence that's already activated. Okay. So my question is, I can change to five days and a vet. My question is, is on step one, where it says, I have left message or no answer on the first call, that it should wait one hour until the next step. But that's where it's waiting five days to send the email. In your view queue, it probably already sent that email. Because see where it says, I sent the screenshot where it says last task, which means that email was sent. And now it's just waiting for that reply condition to be met. So I sent an 1151. So just a couple of minutes ago. And I put like a red box around it. So the email has been sent. Yeah. So see where it says last task. that email was sent and we're waiting for an outcome to then determine the next task. So the email was sent and because it said five days, the next task, like if they don't reply in five days, so on 9-13, then it'll go to step three. So that last task was the email was sent. like if it was a call okay so between steps it would say call is the last okay i guess what was confusing it says send email it doesn't say email sent i guess that's maybe just some semantics to go in okay yes you gotta look at like the column heading really the last task was was that the email was sent okay all right i guess i misread that i know you got to jump because i see last task send email and the last task outcome, I guess, waiting. It was waiting to, okay, okay, I understand now. So it's semantics on that. So, okay, I understand now, Robin. Thank you very much for correcting my ignorance. Yeah, the last task is always what was the thing? The step type is send email. But that was the last thing done. But then we're waiting to determine, like, was it replied to? Was it, you know, any of those conditions? So we're just waiting. If they reply, then it's whatever reply is doing. But if they don't reply, it's going to sit in this waiting until. Now, if you had something like call and then, let's say it was call, and then two days later, go to a LinkedIn, for example, then you would see last task call, next task LinkedIn, and then when that LinkedIn thing is scheduled for. So that's more like a manual task where there is no waiting for conditions to be met kind of thing. Then you'll see what the next task is. Okay. I think I understand it now. All right. Thank you so much for your patience. You are welcome. Did I go and close the ticket? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Okay. All right. Have a great day. Thanks. You too.",
