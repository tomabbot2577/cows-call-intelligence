    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Hey, Jim, can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. So, yes, I want to show you around the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter. Are you there, Luke? Do you hear me? I think I was muted. Hey, yeah, I can hear you. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, so I want to just kind of show you around the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter, kind of show you how that works. Do you use it in all the email campaigns that you likely have already? Yeah, we use campaigns. Okay. So what the sequencing does is it's actually going to give you basically reactive campaigns almost. So that's going to give you the ability to build your own sequencing templates. So you could say that maybe – and it might even be something like a drip campaign alone. So it will just send an email, wait three days, send another, wait four days, send a third. So those are pretty much set and forget. Launch it and it will run. Or you could do something like send an email. if they open it then send them this one if they don't open it in two days put them on my call list or maybe if you use ring central you could even include a text message to be one of the steps in the sequence as well so what the sequencing does it would add a whole new button up in the main menu bar at the top of the screen so you see would add sequencing up there that's going to be where you would go to build your sequences and I think it also comes with a couple of sequences so when you go into your sequencing area it kind of opens and launches a whole new window. It's going to give you the ability to look at your templates. That's where you're able to design the sequences. And I think these two are pre-loaded. So you would get these two standard ones in there, business development, candidate engagement. Those are kind of two popular uses for the sequencing tool. And then you can go ahead and edit the branches. So this one, for example, step one is going to be a form letter. So you can kind of pick whatever form that you want in there and then you could say maybe if the email is replied to they've completed the sequence I was just trying to get a hold of them that's all I needed but if no interaction occurs in three days or you could make it four days or eight days or whatever then continue to the next step and then you're able to decide what the next steps going to be in this case it's a call so I can say that would add it to my call list so I'll show you my my kind my to-do list there. Things like calls, LinkedIn items, schedule requests, stuff like that. Those are something I have to do that's not automated. So they're going to show up on a task list, which I'll show you in just a sec. But actually then my call, what I can do is then I can select various different options. If it's connected and I select that, they're done. If I select send message, it's going to move them to the next step. Same with no answer. That's another email. so I'm able to kind of build my various different templates and I can see like some of these are going to be a little longer so you can kind of build different templates and you could say if this then go to there anything like that it's pretty simple to do and you get those two to start with so the templates are going to run on a roll-up list so a sequence runs on a roll-up list you can assign the roll-up list before you activate the sequence or you could keep the sequence always running on a roll-up list and how you'll know that a roll-up list has a sequence running on it you'll see a couple of might have the little sequencing icon there and if I hover it'll tell me what sequence is running on that roll-up list so that's going to kind of give me a heads up that if I add someone to that that roll-up they're going to start the DS stages sequence or if I add them to the account management candidates are going to start the candidate reach out sequence so they run off of a sequence there they are going to happen automatically and if you had something if it was more than a drip campaign and you had some some things you needed to do if you go into sequencing the very first thing that pops up is going to be a task list and this is going to show me that in this sequence I started with 207 people and 14 of them have since done whatever it is maybe it's open to my email that puts him on my call list okay so I can go through here and I can say I'm going to to the first one it opens up his record it's going to show some basic contact info kind of the basic record data a synopsis of his activity and then over here in the upper over in the right hand side you're going to be able to pre populate a script so if you have a specific script that's going to be part of this call populate that in there so the individual working within this task list they could even just click to dial the cell phone using ring central so click to dial read the script mark whatever happened it'll move to the next step it'll then go to the next person then I go to John Zucker click the dial read my script mark the left message it'll then move to the next person so what kind of helps you to work through a process here in this case this is a phone call some other things that are a bit more manual are going to be LinkedIn related items so I could say that maybe I want to send a connection request to these individuals on LinkedIn if I go into that specific option I can tell I've got his photo there so I can probably get right to his LinkedIn profile I just click the button that will jump right to his LinkedIn profile send my request mark complete or I can remove him manually if I mark complete that'll move them out of the next step so you're able to kind of work through this task list and there's also the the other popular one is going to be schedule you can put that these are people I need to schedule a call with so if I go into each one of them it's going to give me a little call scheduling handler over here throw a meeting on schedule that meeting could do some for things with that. So it's going to let you kind of do it two ways. It could be a little bit more involved, like things to do like calls and schedules and LinkedIn related items, or many people just use it as a drip campaign piece and send one email, wait two days, send another. If they open, if they get a third, if they don't, they get a different third email. So you have a lot of visibility on that. And then a nice part about it too, just one more thing to show you, if I'm looking at a specific roll-up list and I could see this one has a sequence running on it anyone on that list that has partook in that sequence if I look at Jed Olson he gets some activities that are automatically going to be recorded so you could see he completed the sequence here he was marked no answer back in June so I can see any sequence related activities are created right there it's going to show what happened so that is kind of building your activities there as well as you go through there Interesting. Okay. That's pretty much it in a nutshell. Any questions? Yeah. Okay. So right off the top of my head, just a few. Is there an easy way to, within sequencing, have it branch the candidate into like another rollup? If, you know, say they complete one part of the sequence and not another, can we have them get added to a rollup? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you can do that. You can certainly do that. And you might even have a separate sequence running on that roll up list. Because one of the options, you can go through here and you can say, what is it going to do? And then the action is going to be jump to a different branch or remove them. Or I think that you can do attach to a position, put on a roll up, you can do some different things as you go through there. Okay. Where, like where, sorry, you said, I'm just kind of curious about like which specific, what the capabilities are like for it. You said you could, you could have it add to a roll up. I don't see that there. Yeah, I don't either. And I'm trying to think of where it is. Let's see. Might be for like a specific trigger, maybe. I know that like automations kind of have like some actions require certain triggers not sure I'm just gonna send someone a quick chat because I don't even remember I don't do a lot of the setup so I don't know I just said a chat okay so one of my trainers yeah no no worries I know you only can position I'm pretty sure you could do a roll up as well okay Okay, that's good to know. While we wait on that, I noticed like when you were within the sequence, you had like all those different task types. I saw like there was like calls. Not sure what menu that was, but you could see like kind of all the different buckets that people were moved into. Oh yeah, kind of where it is. maybe those are steps or branches or she I actually said s Robin you can add a new branch which is put someone on a roll-up list so if you have branch that branch let's see if I'm doing it right so somewhere you can add a new branch to add someone to a roll-up list that makes Oh, that was associated to a position. So some, yeah, like I said, I don't do it, but my trainer, she said, yeah, just add someone to a roll-up list using a different branch. So you can use that branch to add them to my roll-up list. So you can do it. I just don't. And were you thinking about the task list? Yeah, on the second question, yes. So like you see all emails, calls, SMS. can you make custom task lists or are those all like default those are default those are the various steps that could be the end result of one of the steps in a sequence so those are hard coded those are the different things you could do so you can't make up your own step yeah yeah got it um okay that's good to know as well uh trying to think about what else i'm i'm kind of thinking about like use cases for us, I'm, there's obviously the recruiter use case and like business development, but I'm also trying to think about if, if there's a way we can, like for researchers, like for updating candidate records or like improving that workflow for them, you know, that they're not actually doing outreach necessarily, but just trying to like clean things up or get things moved into, you know, the right sequence or that individual into the right sequence so I'm trying to think okay is there a use case for them so this is good to know what um yeah go ahead I was going to say the cost to add it for you is just a one-time setup of 250 there's no additional monthly because you're already on the premium package so it's included in the premium package just 250 gets it turned on and that includes two hours of training on the setup and use as well. Sure. Okay. And then that's for every user on the account, right? For everyone. Yep. Okay. Great. Okay. Well, let me... Yeah, I mean, this is good. This has been well explained. I feel like I have a good idea of what it can do. I'll talk to some people on the team about it and yeah, I'll let you know if we want to move forward. But I appreciate you showing me all this. Not a problem. Not a problem. If you come across any questions, let me know. And if you want to move forward, I can do it. I think we don't even need a new contract. We just send over an invoice for the 250. Once it's paid, I get a ticket in queue and they would turn that on and the trainer would get in touch to kind of walk you through and show you how to work with everything. Awesome. OK, yeah, I'll I'll just shoot you an email with which way we're we're kind of leaning and then we can just go ahead and do that. Perfect. I look forward to hearing from you. OK. All right. Thanks, Jim. I appreciate you hopping on. My pleasure. You take care. Thank you.",
