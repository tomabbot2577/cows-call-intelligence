    "text": "Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Jonah Shields over at Dimensional Search. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Doing pretty good. Got a quick question for you, and I don't know if I'm in the right spot, but I need to change the account that is being drafted for my PCR fee. Do I do that through you guys, or do I have to go through Dimensional? Oh, yeah, that would be through us. Let me transfer you over to billing. One second. Okay. Thank you. It went right to voicemail. They must already be on call. Let me transfer you to the voicemail for Robin. She's head of billing, and just leave a voicemail letting her know that you want to change some things with your card on file, and she will get back to you ASAP. Okay. Perfect. All right. So sending you to Robin now. And then, yeah, just call back in if you have any other questions. All right. Thanks, Garrett. Have a good one. Bye.",
