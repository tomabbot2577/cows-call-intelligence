    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. Robin? Yes, hi. I have a question. I'm replacing somebody in the office, and I haven't done this in a while, so I know it's easy. So I need refreshments, like how to add a name in the company. I have a resume, so I know that was automatically like a control and paste, but can you guide me how to do that? Okay, so if you're on the company record, so the person works for that company, is that correct? Yes, I wanted to add a person with a resume under the company and then to link to position. So I know there was an automatically way where I was clicking and everything, all the records from the resume and the resume was automatically added, but I forget how to do that. Okay, you can either do it directly from the company that you know you want them in. So if you go to the company record and open up the company. Okay, there's a couple of ways you can get there. It's really, but it's what's called the add resume icon. So a couple of ways you can get there is like if you're in your search results, you don't even have to open the company. You could go to action, say add resume, and then that will pop up that window. Okay, hold on. So I'm not now on the – I have a basic search at the top, and down I have my company. So I have any company name, position, interviews, your roll-ups, and over there I have like a plus ad company or ad new name. So there's another option. It looks like a piece of paper. Do you have that? It's called ad resume? Ad resume, yes. Okay, that's clicking that option. will pop up a window. Mm-hmm. And then what you can do is click open and grab the resume. Open and, okay, so I need to save the resume somewhere. I think there was one way that I was just, everything was doing with clicking, copy, paste. It's not that, like, paste. Let me see. Where is the resume currently? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I put paste. Okay, so I get everything. Okay. If the resume was sitting on your desktop, then you would use open and browse to it. Otherwise, you could use paste. Yes, I did paste. Okay. And I'm so sorry, what is your name? Daniela Sofesca. So now click to view. And I'm sorry, what is your last name? Sofesca, S-O-F-E-S-K-A. So now I want. Can you say that again? I'm sorry. I've got to look for it. Sorry. I had Daniela and my last name is SOS ESKA okay so now I have this record and I want to connect to assign it for a position okay so you can either do that in that ad resume screen it'll say position. If you go over to the right of the position field there's a picker. I have an alarm on his name and I have edit name resume interviews activities roll up. Are you still in that ad resume screen? Yes. Okay so in that ad resume screen over at the right you'll see a position field right position field I have delete record link to position that one that them yeah it sounds like you're in the record now did you already create and save it aha yes I created okay then you would use the link to position but there's also that option when you were bringing in the resume like before you saved it there was a position option at the right that you You could do it before, like as you're creating it. See, I didn't show that one. Where was I? To roll up the list. Okay, like director of operations. I just did this one and director of position. And then I'm done. I can, this is correct, right? Yeah, that's just like one way. There's quite a few ways to get there. Like even that ad resume, you can do it from the front screen of the position or, I'm sorry, of the company. You could also just open the company, click names, and then you'll see the add resume option there. So it's kind of available throughout Peace Recruiter. What way you do it really kind of depends where you are. What's the fastest way to get there? Yeah, I just needed refreshment. I haven't done this for 10 years. And she was like, I'm going on vacation. I was like, okay, I got it. And then I logged in and I was like, oh, this doesn't look the same like 10 years ago. Okay, yeah, I refreshed my memory. We thank you so much for your help. You are so welcome. Have a good weekend. Thanks, Yutum. All right, thanks. Bye.",
