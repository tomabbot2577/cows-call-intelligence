    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yeah. Hi, Garrett. Hey, this is Rich Rice with Healthcare Recruiters International. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Hey, I got a question for you, my friend. So we've set up a custom field, a custom company's field, right? And I've given it a custom name. and we are basically, I did a roll-up. We've sent it out to all the recruiters. We're asking to fill the information in this field. I want to do a bulk upload, right, when they send their spreadsheets back to me, but I don't know, like, what name I should use to make sure it goes in the appropriate field. Like, I think I'm asking for, like, whatever the back-end SQL code is. You know what I'm talking about? Okay, so, yeah, you're doing an import with a CSV file, and you've got to name that column in your CSV file exactly what the name is of your – Okay, yeah, I'll double-check what that is. It's probably going to be just simply, like, what you named it, but sometimes there's underscores and things. I could check on that. What is your username to get into PCR? My username is R-R-E-I-T-Z, as in zebra, and the number one. Okay, awesome. All right, so I'm going to go back over to custom fields, company. It's a company, yeah, company custom field, and this field is called company jobs page. Got it, okay. So, yeah, let me take a look and see if it has any strange or different notation. No, yeah, that would be fine. So your column header should just be company space jobs space page. And it'll when you're mapping it during the import process, it'll have a slot for you to put it in custom field. And if you've named it the exact same name as the actual field, then all that data will go to the right place. Okay, I'm glad I asked, right? Because I know like when I do like bulk imports for like LinkedIn, you know what I mean? That has to be social underscore LinkedIn for it to go in the correct. Yeah. So let me just ask you, just from a database standpoint, would it be when I set these custom fields up, right? And I have a couple of words. Would it be better if I underscored them or space is acceptable? Space is totally acceptable. the only time you would have to like memorize a specific way that a field is listed during an import would be if it was one of the ones that already came with PCR like social underscore LinkedIn but there is a trick that you can do to see how those are notated in the back end basically if you wanted to open up a name record, you could go to that customize gear icon where you adjust your record layout. That lists all the kind of back end ways of naming each field for import. So you have one called email underscore other. On the front end, it's just email space other, but on this customize the record layout screen, you can see that it has that underscore, and that's what it will need during import. Okay. So, right, so, boy, I just wanted to test one for LinkedIn, right? And I see I've got two custom fields. One is social underscore LinkedIn with a capital L, and I've got custom social LinkedIn with a lowercase L. oh okay uh let me let me check that you're seeing this i just started to type l-a-n-k right oh in the uh record layout you're gonna click to set all right let me see link yeah i'm just playing with i'm playing in group one and i just start typing l-a-n-k and i now see i've got two shite. I see that as well. You know, it might not matter with the capitalization. I wouldn't be surprised if no matter what you set that in your record layout, it would show the same data. Okay. So, but here's my question, which is where it's a bit confusing for me, right? Because you know, your LinkedIn stuff is basically, it's embedded. It's almost like it's predefined. You know what I mean? Right. Right. But here it has to come in as a custom to hit the LinkedIn. Would the same apply for like Facebook? You understand? Yeah. Yeah. There's a social underscore Facebook. The reason it's those are listed as custom is because they were created by our team kind of after the initial creation of our software. So the predefined are the ones that have just always been there since day one. And then we started bringing in some custom. They're considered custom on this screen, but they're actually come with PCR still. So social underscore LinkedIn is an example of one of those. OK, got it. Perfect. Oh, hey, thanks a bunch for help. This is what I did. This is exactly what I did. You just made my life so much easier. Good to hear. I appreciate your time, buddy. Hey, have a great Friday and a lovely weekend ahead. You as well. Thanks so much. Okay. Talk to you. Bye.",
