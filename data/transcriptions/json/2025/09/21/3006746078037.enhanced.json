    "text": " Good afternoon. This is Jim. Jim, good day. It's Ben Williams. Hey, Ben. How are you? Good, good. Bear with me a little bit if you don't mind. I'm just starting my two-hour trip. Are you myself point of contact now? Is it Jim or Jim Wise? Either of us. Jim Wise is kind of transitioning out, still working here, but slowly transitioning out. So I can certainly be one to help, absolutely. Oh, so this is now like retired transition out or leaving? Yeah, he's leaving, kind of going to do his own thing. So slowly just starting early stages of that. Gotcha. Okay. So we had a – how much do you know about our account and all that stuff? So maybe we can start there. Okay, I don't know much of any. I'm just learning about it now. Okay. So we were with you guys, then we left, then we came back. We had quite a few recruiters, and then now we're back in rebuilding. We have, if you look at our database, it's ProVitas technology. but we're moving all of our talent solution stuff over to Moja Incorporated. So the first thing we need to do is we need to get the name on the database chain. Okay. And I talked to Garrett about that. And then we need to get our web link so you can hit our site. We're going through a complete web rebranding the whole thing. That's the first two things we need to do as well. Okay. We originally had five licenses. We went down to three just until we go through this. We're going through like a little, I don't know, thing. But we're probably going to end up probably somewhere in the realm of like, I don't know, 10 to 15 within the next, probably I would guess, the next, let's call it 12 to 18 months. We'll probably, maybe not quite 15, but maybe like 8 to 10. Okay. Okay. So the most important part now is why we got, you know, we got the free licenses and we're coming out of dynamic CRM or ATS. We've been using the system now for probably a couple months, maybe like six, seven, eight months. I don't even know, maybe longer than that. And we're liking the features. I'm liking the flexibility, but I need to make sure things are, you know, lined up. So I just reached out. So we purposely didn't finish our training hours. because I was going through a little bit of a, I was going to do another little shake up here. But then when I reached out to Garrett, I think we had like, I don't know, 16 or 14 hours, something like that, that we didn't use, right? So we don't need train up hours. We need set up hours. So I need things set up. So I don't, you know, and we didn't use our hours. So that's the first thing. So, like, one, I want to be able to use the time card feature. I want to be able to use the pipeline feature. And then we have a list of reports that are already in the system that we want to make sure that they work and the dashboard, right? So what I never got a good handle on is your new dashboard. It's called, what do you guys call that? Analytics? Analytics, yeah. Yeah. So that has a different, it's very different. So I guess from a salesy standpoint, I want to kind of know, like, what analytics is. We want to see things like current consultants for the person and all of that. But the mission critical is the timesheet, the pipeline, and our commission reports so we can stop double jockeying numbers. So all that being said, we're trying to figure out, okay, how do we get this all set up and go and all that stuff. I need the name to change for sure. And Garrett sent me a consulting agreement. I don't know why that is, but I don't understand the document that he sent me. Is there something I need to say that, hey, you know, we're moving over, change the name? Maybe it's a different document. I don't know. Are you aware of something different? I don't know. So I'm trying to get into your account here. So you need to change the name of the company and the database and the link and everything. Yeah, the link's not up right now. purposely primarily the company information but somebody sees when they click on a link it needs to click on the link that says you know Moja incorporated mm-hmm see so so is that like the job board piece or the website piece or the name of the database or everything? If you can change everything so it's consistent, that would be great. Okay. If you would, I want you to email me so I can get the correct spelling and look of the new name so we can get that out, so we can get everything changed. So we'll change the URL, the name of the database, get that changed and done. So that's one thing we do. I'm going to be driving for the next four or five hours, so can I just give it to you? Yeah, go for it. It's simple. It's Moja, M-O-J-A Incorporated. M-O-J-A Incorporated. Okay. It's still the same. I don't think we need to sign a new agreement because I think you're the signer. so that wouldn't change okay so let's see so yeah you're the signer yeah so we'll just change the company name in my database to should it be changed to mocha incorporated yeah that'd be great so when the new recruiters come in they just see moja and they're not confused with them now we know our notes and stuff when I say probitas but that's okay we can deal with that internally but anything outward facing and anything forward facing, we want to, you know, like you go to MojaInc.com. You know, we're making a complete separation from the two companies. It just caused a lot of customer confusion. Okay. So I will also put in tickets to get the name of the link that you're going to to get into the database changed and also the name of the database. Do you have this hooked into a website anywhere at all right now? No, but we're going to need that hooked into our new website. It's just getting developed now. That's good. If you did, there would be a whole bunch of change involved there. None of that would work anymore, but you don't have anything, so that's good. So that is good there. So, yeah, I don't think I need anything signed. So I'll go ahead and get tickets in to get that change going. I might also want to put you in touch with somebody to get the training underway. There's training on the set up for anything. I got an email from Garrett that said your training expired. And I'm thinking to myself, why would the training expire? You know, I don't know. There was like, for me, there was no time limit on that. And, again, we purposely stopped because I was, you know, it wasn't going in the right direction. So I wanted to make sure that I just stopped the bus. So, yeah, I mean, the training is, or the training or the setup or whatever you want to call it, is what I really need. And I don't need anybody to walk us through the, let's call it like the mundane stuff. Like I just need, okay, here's the pipeline. Here's what we want to do. Can you set it up? How do we use it? You know what I mean? Okay, here's the commission report. You know, can we set this up? How do we use that? You know what I mean? Those kind of things. I don't, you know, we've had your system, I think it was seven or eight years before. So we know how it works. And then I want to sit down when I get these things cleaned up, or maybe in the same part, and kind of go through the whole sales pitch again. You know, just to make sure, not the sales pitch, but kind of the new features and stuff like that, so I can see those in action. Now, is that something you would do? Probably. Probably. I could give you a demo of some of the new stuff and show you around that a bit. The training, unfortunately, I don't make the call on that, and it does expire after six months. So I'll have to see what we can do about maybe getting some of that remade available to you. Yeah. I'll look into that. I don't know what they normally do, but I'll check and see. Now, why would that expire after six months? I'm just curious. What is the purpose of having open hours out there? Are you outsourcing that or is it already paid? Like, I don't know why that would expire. No, it's included with the original purchase. It's done all in-house here, but I think they started – it used to last a year, and what they found out was people weren't using it, and then they would just kind of leave the hours hanging out there, and then they just had too many tickets open and too many people that forgot about it or anything like that, so I think they started putting a six-month time limit on it, and they canceled it out after six months, so it expires. So I'll see if I can get it unexpired. I think we did no training hours for a year. So, again, we purposely did not use our hours. And I don't know if it was communicated with my old COO, Randy, but that's part of the reason why he's not our COO anymore, right, because it wasn't – I knew I was going to make some changes. So those training hours are training slash setup they are, correct? Yeah. Yeah, those training slash setup hours, those are important to us, and we need to get those done. and we'll probably burn through those hours within the next, you know, I think we had like 14 or 16. I can't remember. How many do you normally get? You normally get 10. It looks like you had 16, so that was a wildly high number of them, but it looks like you used like three and a half of them or so. So I don't know. Yeah, we'll probably burn through those in like a week. I mean, our stuff's pretty pointed. I just need somebody to set it up and show us, right? I don't know. Do you have multiple trainers now? Who's doing your training? Yeah, we have a team. It could be Jason. It could be Nick or Robin or Garrett. So we have several people. I got you. I got you, yeah. So that's it. So looking at the database and everything, I mean, as a system, I'm liking what I see, but it needs setup and some user friendliness that I want to put some things in place. but the ones that I mentioned are kind of mission critical, right? Like I want to get our consultants using our timesheet. And then another quick sales question, can the login timesheet, can that be on our website? Like in a login portal or does that have to – okay. Yeah, it goes on your website. We've never successfully got that set up. So there will be two links that have to go on the website then, correct? Yeah, for job posting an application and then for timesheets. Right. And I'm just curious, so how does it get, you know, we send the manager a link, like how does all that work? Like I've seen it, but has that changed over time? No, no, that's pretty much the same. So that is going to be, there's going to be a link that you would push into your site, and there would be an email would be sent out to the approver once the hours are entered. So whether or not they're a user in PC Recruiter or not, they just get an email, then they can click the link in that email, and they can approve the hours from there. And there's a way to, do you guys have GeoPunch and stuff like that? Yeah, there's an app, so you can actually have them download the app, and they can use that to punch in and out, and that will geotrack where they are. Okay, so just in concept, we set the customer up. I mean, set up the consultant up. They get a link where they log in, they put their hours in, and then on a daily basis, it goes to their manager, their contracting manager? I think a weekly basis. They can submit the hours at the end of the week, and then it will go for approval from their app. But they punch in and punch out like a normal app, correct? In the app, yep. And you've got to set up any schedules and stuff like that, or just more like, here you go, punch in? Just punch in. There's no schedule or anything, but they just go in, open up the browser, and they can clock in and clock out, and then it tallies the hours at the end of the day for that. And the app does the same thing? Yeah. Well, the app does that. The website, you don't really – no, you can. You can actually punch in and out on the website or the app, but the app will track where they are. The website doesn't. Okay. Because we've got potentially some customers that are not going to – now, can you make it that they have to punch in and stuff like that? I don't think so, not to my knowledge. Okay. because we have some consultants on sites that they're not going to have their phone with them. So, okay. At the end of the day, they can put in their hours worked, their in and out times or anything like that. Yeah. Okay. All right. That's kind of what I need right now for a glimpse. So when is Jim's official last day, move-on day or whatever is that? I don't know that that's been designated yet. I don't really know. Okay. All right. And how's the company doing other than that? All right. All right. We're moving along. No complaints. Has it got to be more of a competitive world in the ATS market? It has. It has. It's more competitive, and a lot of people are recruiting kind of down. So a lot of people's business is down. So it's a rougher market than it was, but we're doing okay. So you're saying staffing companies not have as much business? are just laying off not as many headcounts. Not as much business, not as many users, not as many positions. Over the last couple of years, it's kind of heading in that direction. Huh. That's interesting. What do you think is the drive of that? I'm just curious. I don't know. I don't know if it's a combination of companies aren't hiring or maybe with AI people are trying to do it themselves. I don't know. It's just a lot of people saying they've had the worst time since 2009. Wow. Okay. All right. But we're not exactly seeing that. We did a strategic kind of layoff downside. But, yeah, I mean, okay. I mean, we had a little bit of a – because we did a lot of federal stuff during COVID, but our issues were more just bad management, right? Bad management on a local level. So, okay. All right, well, good to find out. Just curious, you know. I was like, all right, if you can get back to me, that would be great. And, you know, like I said, those are my hot buttons. And then, you know, I'm feeling we'll be, like I said, like. you know, next 18 months, 10 to, let's just call it 8 to 10 to be conservative, right? Because we're planning on going into two other states and add a couple salespeople and all these other stuff. We've got to fix the initial processes. That's kind of what got us in trouble the first time. We never really, really nailed down our processes the way I like to. now we got a pretty nailed down small group and then we'll we'll grow from there okay well let me find out what i can about that get the tickets in to get everything moved and and kind of take it from there okay great appreciate it jim thanks not a problem all right take care bye",
