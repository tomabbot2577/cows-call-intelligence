    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Seekers Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett? Did you say it was Garrett? Yes. Garrett, I'm glad I got you, man. How's your day going? It's Haas over here at Serenity MedSearch. Hey, how's it going? It's going well. It's going well. Hey, I have a quick question, man. How do I change the username to a different user? Do I have to do that with you guys, or can I just go into the system and do that? You can go into the system and do it. There's a special spot we could do that in. Let's see. Do I delete the old one and then start a new? That's up to you. If you want to have the person continue using that same username, that's fine. You could even disable a username so nobody can log in under that username anymore and then create a new one. whatever's easiest for you. But the way to change a username, just like change what it's called, go to system in the main menu at the top of PCR. And then in the little search bar on the left, search for change user name and user name has a space in between. Let's see. You're saying go to users or which one? So use the search bar above users and start typing change user and it'll come back with change username as an option on the right. Ah, here we are. you'll just use the drop down to choose the username you want to switch and enter the new username below hit continue and usually it does take a while once you hit continue to really go through all the database and adjust all the activities and records and stuff it could take a while on this okay so would that go if i was to do that then it would change that person's notes to the new person? I believe so, yeah. It would be all switched. Anytime you would see the old username, it's now switched out with the new username. Yeah, I don't want to do that. I'd rather keep the old record intact, you know. Oh, okay. Yeah, in that case, maybe you would want to just create a new username. Is this somebody you don't want to log in anymore on the previous username? we can disable logins on the old one. Well, so it's, I think so at this point. I haven't, I don't believe my boy's working out there. I don't, I think, you know, Christian, he's on the emails with me. Oh yeah, yeah, Christian, okay. So I just don't think he's using the, using it. So I want to switch it to one of my new guys. But at the same time, I don't want, But I'm not looking to take his information and switch it over in the system per se. Does that make sense? Yeah. In that case, why don't you just create another username and just kind of leave Christian's how it is. And that should be fine. Just having that additional username for someone else. Okay. that way you get all the records and activities and everything from the old username everything's untouched that's what i'm i don't want to do i'd rather keep it that way that way just when because i i think he's going to be back it's just a matter of when so so when that happens i i'd like to add the other user at that point but i'd rather not spend it the extra money at this point you know what i mean yeah there you go uh so yeah you in the meantime you can create a username at any point It's just when you have both users logging in all the time using PCR, then just give us a call and say you need to update billing to include another person who's actually using the system. But if Christian's not using the system right now, you don't have to adjust billing if you're just adding this other user in the meantime. Perfect. Okay. And I appreciate that. I thank you for that, Garrett. But I'm going to go through and I'm going to add another user then. And if I have questions, I'll give you a call back. But I appreciate it, brother. Sounds good. Have a great rest of your day. Reach out if you need anything. I definitely will. You do the same, man. All right. Bye.",
