    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey there, Tyler. It's Butch Speedover with Omega Point Partners. How are you this Friday? Good. How are you? Good, good. Hey, I just saw something I've never seen before, so I thought I'd pick up the phone and call. I basically did a search in my database for anything with a quality title to it and try to put it in a roll-up, right? Mm-hmm. And so, you know, of course, I selected all and, you know, did a little click on it. So we put it in the database that I called, excuse me, roll-up I called all quality. But what was really interesting, it said, it gave the number of names, which I had 8,337 quality people in my database, but it said it put 5749 in, and it ignored 2588. I've never seen the ignored part. So the ignored part is because a name record can only be on a roll-up list once, So if that record was already on the roll-up, it'll skip over putting them on it again. Oh, okay. Because they're already there. Okay. Well, I just learned something new. I didn't realize that. Okay, well, that was an easy answer. I appreciate your time. And sorry, Bob has just never seen that one before. Hey, I'll take easy questions like that at the end of the day on a Friday all day long. I hear you, man. Well, you have a good weekend. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
