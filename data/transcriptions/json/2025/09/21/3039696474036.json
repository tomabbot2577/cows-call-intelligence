    "text": " Hello? Hi Renu, this is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Hi, how are you? Thank you for calling me back. Yes, and I just drafted you an email that I kind of like a canned response because we switched billing systems back sometime like in April and we couldn't like take the new, the existing card information over to the new, I guess security or things like that. So you have to put in your card details at least once to do it. So I sent you that standard email that I was sending out to people. It should have been sending you invoices. Have you been getting those invoices? No, but I just want to tell you, I haven't really been working. It's been years. It happened suddenly. My parents are older. My dad just turned 100. It's like all of a sudden I had to put everything on hold, basically. I haven't closed everything that's on hold. I haven't been working. So my question for you is this. I'm on a month-to-month anyhow. What is the way, like, is there any way to preserve all that information and I just hold on to it? I'd have to see what your contract is. Hold on one second. You might be paying monthly, but it may not be a month-to-month contract, which is a big difference. Let me see something here. You're in Mayfield Heights? Yeah, I was in Mayfield Heights. I had to move back there. That's where I lived. That's where I lived. Wait, in Chesterland? No, Mayfield Heights. Oh, you do? Okay, cool. My friends all live in Chesterland. Let's see. Oh, actually, it looks like you might have a two-year agreement. Let me see. Yeah, but that was a while back. Yeah, but it auto-renews. If you never change your contract, it just auto-renews for the initial term. Okay. All right. I don't want to auto-renew this time. Well, how long do I have to do this? Let's see. So it was June. So every, so you renew every even year. So you would be till June 2026. That really sucks because I'm not using it all. I thought it was just month to month and I just was, there was so much going on with them that I just didn't have time. And finally I had time and I was going to call you guys and say, help, let me just close this because I haven't even looked at it. Look, I just happened to look at that email today because I don't even, honestly, I go literally months without looking at my work email. It doesn't kind of show up automatically anymore. Okay. Can I give you my credit card number and you take care of it, or do I have to sign it and stuff? I think I can put it in here. Let me try it here. Let's see. Can I go over here? Okay. Auto pay. It's hard for me to even access my work email a lot. I can do it on my phone. I can't do it on my computer. Like there's all kinds of issues that I will have to deal with once I, if, when, when, and if I start working again. Okay. What is your, okay, go ahead. You need the credit card? Actually, I need the full name on the card first. It's my full name. It's R-E-N-N-C-U. The last name is Kosak, K-H-O-S as in Sam, L-A. Okay. And the card number? Hold on. Okay. Are you there? Yes. It's 6011. Okay. Okay. The 6011-2089. Okay. 9305. Okay. 0536. Okay. and then the month and year 0528 okay and the security number on the card 324 I don't see the point of the security number I never see the point of it what is the address associated with the release of the zip code the zip code is 44026 44026 is that Chesterland or is that Chardon? It's Chesterland. Okay. Chesterland. Actually, what's the updated address too? I'm going to fix that here. It's 7-4-5-4-1-5 Warwick Lane. I'll spell it. W-A-R-W-I-C-K Lane okay all right let me fix that hold on one second yeah I'm just trying to get a screenshot of the address okay now it's fixed at an invoice itself sorry what is your name again my name is Robin Rob Tony okay so I'm going to add the card okay turn auto pay on okay now do you can send a notice before you guys auto renew no it just kind of automatically renews um now what I could do for you I can look into I could see if I get it approved or maybe we just put your account on hold for like a instead of being like the full amount, it's $20 for the remainder of the term. And then that way if you decide you want to recruit, then what we would do is just turn that back on for you. Thank you. That would be so appreciated. You guys have always been great. You know, I was always getting offers to change to somebody else. I never did. If you can help me out in this way, that would be great. It's a lot of money for a season, and I've already wasted all that money. I haven't literally used it for five years, I think. Oh, wow. Three or four years. Yeah. it's just been crazy it's just been insane but we just celebrated my dad's 100th birthday and my mom is 91 so that's amazing right and my laws are 85 to 94 okay so let me see here i can just recognize i do an auto pay now let's see Okay. Okay. I don't know why it doesn't take it like when I first put it in and turn it on. Okay. All right. So I'll do the three that are open and auto-pay. Okay. Okay. And then I'll probably have to do a ticket just for tracking. I'll probably have to send you something. And then what we'll do is we'll lower it to 20 per month. And then you would just want to let us know before June, like cancel or, you know, if you come back before then. But just let us know before then. yeah yeah yeah no you will send the tickets on my bio connect whatever thing yes um can i change the email or that's not allowed because that's the work email that's allowed when i put both i could do like one is like a primary and one is a copy perfect okay let me okay what's the secondary one? It's all lowercase. K-R-E and as in Nancy, U 101 at gmail.com Okay. So let's say you get both places. Because honestly I go months without looking. It does, for some reason it just doesn't, I don't even think about it and I never look at it. But my Gmail is always looking at it. Okay. All right. I will look at this other stuff and get that set up for you. Sound good? Thank you so much. All right. So how will I know? So it'll be $20 starting when? When is your next invoice going? Let's see. So your database is on right now. But what we'll do is we disable it. But basically we're doing that hold fee to at least maintain it. We have to do something for the duration of the contract. Otherwise, what's the point of having a contract? contract right um so your next invoice that would be august 6th so very soon here this week so i'll get that set up for you now okay so that would be twenty dollars right yes oh you're the best robin thank you thank you thank you all right have a great week thank you thanks robin you too bye",
