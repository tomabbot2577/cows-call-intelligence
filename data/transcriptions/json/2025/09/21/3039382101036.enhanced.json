    "text": " Thank you for calling Maine Sequel and Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. It's Jenny with Sandia's Executive Search. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good. Hey, Tyler, is there a report where I can see which one of our users are getting the most inquiries with our job board? Ooh, that is, let me take a look here. Which database are you working in? Construction. Instruction. Closest thing I could find was a summary report through the position reporting tool, but that kind of summarizes the postings, not necessarily how many applicants. Now, let me think. So in the applicant tracking report under the pipeline reports, you can filter those ones by position. and it'll give you total numbers like how many people applied, like how many you like linked to the position, how many online job inquiries there were. Can you walk me through that? Yeah, so let me get back there real quick. One second. All right, so if you go to reports, and then pipeline reports, then there's applicant tracking reports. Yep. So from here you could select that search params. You can select your interview date range. So like if you're doing it like by a specific position, you just put how long that position has been open. So if I want to see how many inquiries we've gotten through our draw board in the last two weeks, it wouldn't necessarily be an interview date range, right? So that's considered an interview in the system. Like when someone applies, any pipeline step, like whether you link name is like considered like an interview in the system. So yeah, if you want to do the past two weeks, you could do it there. Okay. And then you're using the new pipeline now, correct? Yes. Okay. And all the positions that you have open right now are going through the new pipeline? Yeah. Well, new to us. I don't really know what new pipeline means. But, yeah, Drew just set it up for us a few months ago. So new pipeline. And so like when you go to a position and then you view the pipeline tab, like where you see people like in the inbox. Not sure what you're asking. Sorry. Like what, as you're moving people through, like you're hiring steps within a position, that's the pipeline is those steps right right what am I doing with the pipeline so are you using the one that's like vertical up and down let me pull you up here take a look real quick Okay, you guys are using the new pipeline. That's good. So what you can then do in the reports is you have your range set. And then in the bottom half, you'll see the filters. Now, you'll see in the filter by job status over to the right, you have the A, I. That means it's for all available and internal positions. If one of your positions may have closed in that two weeks, you can always backspace those out and clear that. Okay. And then where it says filter by interview type slash status, what you want to do is hit that pop out next to it. Where it says legacy, you can check the box that says online job inquiry. And then also go into the drop down for Sandia's process and hit inbox. and hit select because that'll capture anybody that's gone to that position. Does that include people that like a recruiter drag and dropped into there? Because I would just want to know like how, I'm just trying to figure out how many people are up. So with the new pipeline, We can't really separate out the two in a report. What we can do, though, is on the MyPCR screen in PC Recruiter, there's also that today's stat where it says web candidates. If you click on that web candidates, it'll show you just like the today's stats. Right. But it'll also have that dropdown where it says new names today. It'll give you options for like the last two days, three days, four days, five days, this week, this month. So that can help you break it down by week, like showing who's applied, all the names that have applied within a week. Under web candidates? Yep. So would that just... That's all from today, though. And I... So I believe the ones that... You'll see where it says, oh, go ahead. I delete a lot of them that don't belong in the database, you know, like coffee shop people that apply for construction. But I definitely kept more than this. I don't know. Okay, so back to that report, would I just run that report then, or is there other stuff? You could. I can also try and create a custom stat for you where it can pull all the names that have applied within the last, like applied online within the past two weeks. And that would just be like a continuously running stat. Okay, hold on. I'm looking at this report and it might... Is there a way to split it up by AE or by user? Sorry. No, because when a candidate applies online, you can filter by job, like by job username. But when someone applies online, they come in with the username of candidate. Okay. Now that makes sense. Okay. So how would I filter by job username? I guess that's what I meant. Because I do assign each job to the recruiter. Yeah. So you would just do in the filters, it would just be by, it'll say filter by position username. as one of the filters. And then I would just do each one separately? Yep. Okay. Okay. I guess that's not ideal either. Yeah, maybe... Save search, though. I would... Okay. I might need... I don't know what I need. I just need to be able to periodically or go back in time and say, okay, in the month of August, this recruiter had a ton of applicants and this one didn't. So we can figure out why. If there's a problem or maybe that's just how the cards laid that month. So would that be a safe search or like you were saying, I don't know if that's writing a script or I do have, yeah. So the report's going to be your best option because you can filter by that position username. Okay. Because the saved search is just going to find you the names of people that have applied. We're not going to be able to narrow it down by that position and the username. Okay. So I can use this applicant tracking report and just, you know, do six individual reports. like if we have six recruiters and then that'll be my data because then I can go back in time. Yeah you can always export them to a csv as well if that makes a little bit easy that'll make it a little bit easier to manipulate the data and you can always copy and paste them into one big one if needed. But that that applicant tracking report that pre-built one is going to give you the most flexibility. Okay. All right, cool. I think we got it now then. I'll just take a snip of this and then play around with it later. I guess we're just wanting to make sure, A, that the new job board is helping us, which I think it is, but also kind of seeing how we can help maybe recruiters that applicants are down. Yep. Okay, cool. All right. Well, if you have a client wish list, this report would be on it. All righty. I'll definitely make sure to mention that. We do have an internal feature request, so I'll make sure to throw that on there after we get off the call here. Awesome. Thanks, Tyler. I appreciate your help today. Yep. More than happy to. You have a great day. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
