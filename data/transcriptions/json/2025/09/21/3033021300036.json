    "text": " Hello, this is Elizabeth Rios. Can I help you? Hi, this is Garrett with Name Sequence Technology. Sorry about the phone tag there, but you were calling about the AI features. You had questions about that? Yeah, I took a class, and I think it's Quill something, Quill AI or something like that. I'm guessing because I can't remember off the top of my head, but I remember taking not a class but a meeting webinar on it, and I keep seeing it on LinkedIn. So my question is, how much does it cost and how does it help recruiters that are working at the PC recruiter is my platform. So how does it help and what are the costs associated with it? Okay, good question. So we do integrate with Quill, but you would have to contact them for pricing on that specifically. But this would basically automate note-taking during phone calls, video meetings, and it captures those details and puts it into PCR for you. That's kind of our integration with them is getting details placed into the activities. And yet we don't have any cost associated on our end to use Quill with PC Recruiter, but you'll have to open up an account with them, which does have a cost involved. Yeah, no, I'm not interested. And it's not the cost. It's just the service is not what I was thinking. I was thinking of streamlining and making it easier doing my jobs, I mean, applicant searches through PC Recruiter. So there was another class or meeting that I took that was online that was a webinar, and I thought that was – it would help in just identifying the right candidate for certain jobs by putting a job description or whatever I would put into the system. And I guess that's – you don't have that? Because I know LinkedIn provides it, but I want to see if DC Recruiter provides it because that's where my database is. Gotcha. Yeah, so Quill, that's a separate integration, so you might not want that. But we do have a few AI features that we've included in PCR. We've actually just released it to all customers on a free trial basis. So the ones, the free, or yeah, the AI features that we have are AI job description, where you can have AI generate a job description on a position record. Another one is AI candidate summary, which will allow you to generate something in the summary tab on a name record through AI. AI search, where you can use the quick search bar at the top of PCR, toggle a little toggle on that says AI, and it'll use common phrasing and languaging, or you can use common languaging and phrasing to search. So you could type in there something like what emails were sent yesterday or list hiring authorities with last activity in 2024, something like that. And it'll use your normal sentence structure to kind of as context to bring back results. So does AI search handle just identifying, for instance, if I put an account manager right now into my system, And that's all I put. I don't put the city. I don't put anything, just the title. I will get over 2,200 account managers. So then I started putting whether it's commercial benefit or whatever, right? Because I'm an insurance recruiter, so that's what I do. And still, it brings up 2,200 applicants. So by the time I get to the end, if I ever get there, because by the first 100, I might have the candidate in mind. But those other candidates that are being neglected because the search is not, I guess, concise or narrowing it down to the most specific and most qualified candidates, you don't have a feature that does that? So, yeah, where are you entering in those extra details, like maybe the specialty is maybe what you would call it? Are you putting it in a field or are you putting it on like their notes section? Oh, note section. And on the fields of the application contact information. And yeah, contact information. Okay, yeah. So you can use the search features that are already built into PCR to look for certain keywords that you've added to the record. Or you can use the AI search feature. That'll look through resumes for certain phrases. It'll look through all your fields for certain phrases and it'll look through the keywords tab on a name record. So if you have those more narrowed down terms saved on a field somewhere, saved in the resume or saved in the keywords tab, then I can search through that. But it does sound like you can, even without the AI, use some of our PCR regular search functions to narrow down your search a little bit more so that it doesn't have so many results. Let me actually, I'm going to email you. I don't have the AI feature that you're talking about because I don't see it anywhere on my screen. Right. So not yet. But it looks like you have a ticket open with Jim Lombardo to upgrade your database so that it can have that AI search function. So that's kind of in the works right now. It looks like as soon as they do upgrade it to have the AI, they'll let you know. But, yeah, in general, let me send you I'm going to send you a video from our learning center about searching and the different ways to kind of narrow down your search to get exactly. who you're looking for so it's not such a large net you're casting and having to sort through so many results. Yeah, because I didn't have Lombardo. He helped me on the technical issue that I had, but we really never talked about it. I said, you know what, do you have anything on AI trying to perfect my searches to find the right candidate? And he was going to send me something, and he never did. So I think that's what you're about to do. So I never really talked to him about anything other than that. Okay, cool. Yeah, I'll send you a video about just kind of the regular searching features as well as the AI search so you can kind of compare that. And then we'll get the process started of updating your database so that you can have AI search added to your free AI trial. Fabulous. And how much does it cost once the free trial is over? um so i'm not sure it all kind of depends on what your current contract is jim lombardo will definitely be able to answer the pricing questions but the good news is our management team hasn't really set even a date to end the free trial i think they're going to let it ride for for a while to see um you know the more customers using it providing feedback will help it grow stronger over time the ai so um i think we're going to let it ride for a while as a free trial So, but yeah, as soon as Jim gets back from vacation, I can have him reach out and give you the full details if you want to permanently add AI with the pricing. Well, I want to try it because I want to see if it works. If it doesn't work, it's going to defeat the purpose. But you said that I can modify my searches by just putting in keywords where it says keywords. Yeah, so like, for example, if you store your keywords in the keywords tab, you can use that keywords box. You can do them? I didn't even know you can do that. So, yeah, for example, if you open up a name record, you have a few tabs there like resume tab attachments. Oh, one of them. One of them is called keywords is one of its own tabs. Oh, my gosh. And then you can enter in keywords there to make it more searchable later on. You're more easily searchable later on. So you would save that on the record. And then when you enter the keywords in there in the search field, it will pull up that record. OK. Oh, my gosh. OK. I didn't even know I could do that. Yeah. Let me send you a few few resources from our learning center. I think it'll really help with your searches. I got an article with some screenshots and then a video I can send you. And hopefully that'll help. And if you do have questions about any of those articles or whatever, just let us know and we can help you out. Sounds good. Perfect. OK, I will do that. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah. Happy to help. And I also will get the AI search kind of upgraded and ready to go on your database as well. Sounds good. I have a good one. Thanks so much. Thank you. Bye bye.",
