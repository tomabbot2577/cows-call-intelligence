    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Oh, hi. My name is Anne Hyde. I'm not sure. Did I just speak with you? Martin Snyder is the contact that I'm needing. I'm with National Registration Group, and this is regarding a five-year GSA contract with the federal government. But they have Martin Snyder as the contact. So this is a support line for the software company. Okay. Do you do any government work? No. No? Okay. Is Martin the person that I would speak with to see if he would be interested? So Martin's one of the owners of the company. That's right. Okay, that's who we need to speak with would be an owner. But he is not available at the moment. I can transfer you to our operations manager. No, I wouldn't need to know. I don't have their contact information. That's okay. That's all right. But I normally have to speak with the owner. It would just be a waste of time unless you have a voicemail that you could send me to to leave the message. I do not, unfortunately. Okay. And would you want to take my contact info, or do you do that? Like I said, I could give it to the operations manager, but that's the only person I can pass you along to. Oh, okay. Well, that would be great. Did you say you could transfer me to the operations manager? Yeah. It looks like he's currently on a phone call, but I can transfer you to his voicemail. That would be great. All righty. Give me two seconds here to get him pulled up. All right, transferring in three, two, one.",
