When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hello, James. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call following up with you. With regard to our demo earlier in the week, I had sent you over paperwork for PC Recruiter. I just wanted to make sure you saw that, see if you had any questions, and if you were going to be signing to get started or maybe you had an updated time frame or something. Give me a quick call. Let me know kind of what's going on, if I can help, or if there's a better time I should follow up. My direct dial is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks, James. Hope you're well. I hope to talk soon. Bye-bye.",
