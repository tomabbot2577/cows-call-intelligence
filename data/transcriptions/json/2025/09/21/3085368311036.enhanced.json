I don't know where Mayfield went. No, I went to Brush. So maybe it was Hyrum. Oh, you were. Yeah, yeah. I know we went to Hyrum. So yeah, I forgot we went to Brush. But I was 94. You were a couple years before. Like only one. But probably about the same. I was 68. So I went 60 years, 60 years older. So we went to Hyrum House. And you probably did too. It was kind of close by. But yeah, the cabins were in a circle. It was much smaller. Yeah, I don't remember being a pig. Okay, yeah. So then maybe it was Hyrum. Okay. I don't remember. It was many, many years ago. A long time ago. I don't remember what I did yesterday, let alone when I was 12 years old. Although I can tell you every word to some songs. I don't understand how you do that. I want to just check in and see about, because I'm going through my email, and I have like 100, so I'm working on getting caught back up. And this whole Christina Stone, is there anything that still needs done with her? She was the one. She needed a data return, a reduction in users, and a cancellation. hold on one second because I'm not fusion recruiters yeah okay fusion recruiters okay I can't keep everybody straight right now sorry fusion recruiters user updates okay so let's see did a user update three months ago um are these oh I'm hold on one second I have a filter assigned to me hold on one second there's a data request okay I got to see if they paid it though get a request also process the invoice okay so their data return is assigned over McKenzie he hasn't done it yet okay so I'm going to tag him can you please follow up on it it looks like their user adjustment you put that in and they are now down to two so that is done yeah hold on I just don't think anything is assigned to me I think I whatever I did I think I've assigned my stuff over so the data reach return is assigned over to McKenzie removing users three days ago seven to two users and then two months ago no longer terminating the agreement and then that one was closed out. Hold on one second. Determinate, okay. Rather than terminating our entire agreement, we requested to terminate, what? Termination question. Give me a negative. We'd like to continue access to maintain. So the last thing, so in 101.473, they just wanted to go down and have just the two users and just be able to access it. Okay. Are they still canceling or do you know? I haven't, I don't think, wait, let me look at, hold on. Oh, migrating to new tracking system, but I don't know if they're actually canceling. I think they're wanting to still maintain. Oh, not canceling now. Here's a note from three days ago. not canceling now contract up next May did drop to two users so we'll be accessing the database until end of the agreement okay okay so they're going to go to two users for the end till the end of the agreement which is next May yes groovy I think I'm going to give her a courtesy call just to kind of close a loop let her know her returns in process she's already to to confirm she's staying and then I'll kind of throw that just in an activity so we're sure because I there were so many emails from her and she happened to be the oldest one I had so I'm starting at the bottom and working up yeah I mean there was a lot of back and forth and there's multiple tickets I was like wait a minute let me see because I knew I knew the name Christina Stone um yeah the data return that's all paid everything it's just sitting with Mackenzie he's just going on yeah and he was at the dentist yesterday so he was out for a while and yeah i've been throwing a lot of tickets at him and he's he's busy yeah poor guy um i think he was working super late last night too because uh neely pierce i told him i told the guy that called me or i called him back or whatever it was something like steven wagner somebody like that like that told him about do i warned him about duplicate checking if you use last name email address you gotta be careful make sure everybody has an email address. Well, then they're like, oh, well, why did this record change? Because it's last name and blank email address. But then McKenzie, so he's like, well, I need a data restore. And then McKenzie was finding some other things that I'm not really sure how to explain why it changed. So we have to look into that more. But I don't know. What about this Robert Welton from this morning? He opened invoices. He owes three invoices. And he's not even the contract signer. and he says i don't even know who he is so i should probably know you need like if joyhood or the gilbert are no longer there then he needs to have something about he's the contract signer probably right yeah i've got to call him and see hey you're looking to cancel okay we need to talk to whoever the signer is or figure that out and then we can get that moving there so i yeah we need to talk to that Gilbert so I'm going to actually I started a ticket just so we didn't lose it hold on one second um date created let me go here do you have a return oh I filled my filter on that fly um okay I'm just going to put a note in here to Nick um recent communications are with Robert so I didn't find anything like they're not like replying about anything for the invoices for the two emails that we had, the Joy Hood and then the Gilbert person. Who is not the contract signer? created the ticket so we do not lose track of it cool and I'll talk and see what they're doing and okay and I'm going to tag you in this ticket so here I put recent vacations there with Robert Welton who is not the contract that I'm gonna bold that yeah we need to talk to that person okay yeah like pay the invoices first then we'll discuss like i love how people like hey is this we have three open invoices no reply no reply no reply okay don't respond and then i see like you've been communicating with him and i'm like is this the billing email we should be using, no mention of, hey, yeah, that's the correct billing email, or no, switch it to me, or I'll get these paid right away. It's, oh, I want to cancel. And that was like the second time you asked him, is this the correct one? And he just never replies. Yeah. And as my husband tells me constantly, answer the question asked. I'm getting really sick of people like, this is what I asked you I didn't ask you about that we'll talk about that after you answer my question Patsy tells me that all the time she's like answer the question tell the kids too she's like answer the question you're asked don't make up a bunch of other things or bring up other things answer what you're asked she's a Libra she's a Leo oh my god I'm talking my husband is like that like don't tell him a story with any extra details he's like big point first then something else uh ellie is what my daughter is like if she's heard it before she doesn't want to hear it again she's like i know that i've heard that like no patience yep yep i my son's like that my husband's like that very much to the point first time only one time doesn't want to hear it again yeah and and and then you're like yeah my cousin my husband And he'll be like, what's your point? I'm like, well, I'm getting there. Like, and my kids say it all the time, too. It's like, you literally have to say one sentence, see what he says, and then tell your story. Like, it has to be, like, one sentence. You have to get it hooked in. Yeah. There's no, like, hooking them in and then telling, you know, even if it's, like, two or three sentences. He's like, get to the point. I'm like, well, if you would let me speak for, I don't know, another 10 seconds. I was getting there. oh it's so funny we laugh about it it's just how he is a few words yeah yeah i think that's all the things yeah i'm trying to think oh um somebody else i think i tagged you in recently there was the colonial williamsburg or the colonial group in williamsburg it looks like oh that's a possible upgrade because they're still pay 49.95 that was the one that just has asp but asked about mail campaigns so they were there okay they're in my queue I think that's all I had that were you were involved in okay well that's good are you going to the meeting at 1145 there's a meeting at 1145 you didn't know about it no what's it about oh shit you don't have that that's one of your emails probably no I've looked through every life who was from? Let's see. Steven, lunch meeting invite. Who do they have? Nick, me, Jason, Garrett, Mackenzie, Dylan, Tyler, Drew, James Blair, and Bill. Why are you not on here? Maybe it's support? I don't know. I don't know. I'm on the phone with Jim Lombardo and asked if he'll be at the meeting. He doesn't know anything about it. Maybe it's a support related meeting and I didn't need to be involved. I don't know. But I've got no invites. Nothing. Have I heard about it? heard about it. Was he overlooked? Or not needed? Or does not need to attend? Yeah, because I got nothing.
