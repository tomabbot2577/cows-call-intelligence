Say it again? Was Nick Young the individual who introduced us? No, I don't believe so. I don't know Nick Young. Okay. No, I sent a video. When did we speak? I don't think we spoke on the phone, but we exchanged emails on, let's see, July 21st. Excellent. Okay, thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, Monday, Monday. Okay. It's been a hell of a week for me, Doug. Sorry. There you go. I see those now, Doug. appreciate that. No worries. Okay. Yeah, I just wanted to, obviously, you haven't had a chance yet to catch the video. No, I have not. In fact, I'm prepping for my last call of the day here at five o'clock, and I am trying to make sure I'm prepped for that. Let's do this, Doug. let me watch that video tomorrow and then I will respond, give you my feedback via email and then we can go from there. How does that sound? Yeah, sounds great. I appreciate you sending that over. I am looking forward to seeing this. Alright, cool. Well, good luck on the 5 o'clock call and maybe we'll touch base at some point tomorrow. Thanks. I appreciate it, Doug. I'll go forward and talk to you. All right. You too. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
