When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Hello, Deborah. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just following up with you to touch base. We talked in the past about your possible interest in exploring the cloud-based version of PC Recruiter to replace the current self-hosted version you have. And I've been having some conversations with some people at your organization, and there's been some, I don't know, some issues or something going on with it. So I thought I'd follow up and just kind of touch base, see if that was of interest to you, if we could rekindle that discussion. I also have been in contact with David, so I'm going to give him a call as well. My direct is 440-856-0314. If you'd like to give me a call, let me know if you want to discuss that more, if you have any additional questions at all. once again Jim with PC recruiter 440-856-0314 thanks we'll talk to you soon bye",
