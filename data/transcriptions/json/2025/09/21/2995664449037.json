Probably maybe tomorrow, probably Monday. Pretty soon. It just takes a couple days to get everything turned on. I also want to chat with you about the duplicate problem you were having. The trainer should be able to kind of figure out what is going on with that and kind of offer some assistance. I wanted to gather a little information about the basis of what's going on so I can share that with them. Give me a quick call. When you get a moment, order up an email. 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks.",
