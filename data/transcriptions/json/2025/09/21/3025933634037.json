    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Dave Hosmer. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? I think I just figured it out, Robin. I'm sorry. That's okay. When I edit the candidate information in a custom field, I can move them up or down however I want them, correct? So you're talking about in your layout? Yeah, my layout, yeah. Okay, yeah. Once you go into a group and you pick the field, you could drag it up, down, over to another group to change the layout. And then just make sure you click save at the top right. I'm in there now. So if I add one. Well, you can't add a new field. You can only select a field once it's created. I'm trying to create one now. So I hit the plus sign to create it. So if you don't have the field existing yet, what are you trying to add? I'm trying to put tech ID in here. Okay. Let me save it. Okay. So you have to create the custom. It'll be a numeric number we're going to enter. Yeah, we don't have a numeric field. It's just like date or currency. So it would just be a no action. So you have to first go to system, custom fields, and then depending on the right type. Name custom fields. Yeah. Is it for a name records? Yeah, it is. Okay. So that's where you would create the custom field? I don't see it. You said I entered as a note? No. Taxary field? No, hold on. I'm sorry, Robin. Yeah, you're going to leave it set to – so where are you right now? I'm in the – I went to system. I went to custom field. Okay, custom field. And then custom name field. Name custom field. Perfect. Okay, so these are where you're going to list the custom fields that you've created for the database. So you would click add and give the field a name. Add custom field, okay. Give it a name. I'm going to call it tech ID. Okay. And I always try to, whenever you're making custom fields, avoid like any special characters. Oh, I just put a number. I just did tech space ID. Is that all right? Sure. Okay. And then leave it as no action. Okay. And then hit save. save. So that now makes the field an option. So then what you're going to do is go to name up on your main toolbar and pull up any name record. And then you're going to go to that customize, which is like a gear icon within the name record. It's going to be up in that menu where you hit save or position. That's going to show your layout. okay so what you're going to need to do is figure out where you want it and so within that group if you go down at the bottom of the group where it says click to select field I don't see it here yet so I just create I created check ID is it an alphabetical order in here so did you say you saved the field name right I did I saved it okay did you go over to any name record yeah I pulled up a name record. I hit the gear icon like you said. Okay so now you should be in the customized layout screen right? I am. So then you're gonna have groups like first name, last name in a group and then another group maybe with address. So at the bottom of that group we should see an option that says click to select field. When you click directly on that spot you'll get a drop-down. Oh. And then it's probably because you just created, it's probably going to be the last one, but if you know the field name, you can start kind of typing it to filter that list out. Tech ID, I got it. Okay. So once you have it picked, then you can drag it up or even over to another group and drop it where you want it to actually be positioned. Let me see. I'm just pulling up another name record. I opened another screen on PCR to make sure I put it in the right spot here. I put it right before stage if I take it and I drag it up to stage and then I save that where I save that at Robin so in your customized field selection and sort order screen I should have your save option at the top right okay I saved it no hit again so then what you're going to do is close my screen and then it should be in your layout so if I want to I'm in the layout right now so I can move it up one more screen if I wanted right I can move it up you mean one more spot yeah yeah just kind of drag it where you want to go well we have to be in that customize screen though and save it. Let me see where it went. Now when I save it, will Jeremy, the other user, be able to see this too, Robin? No, that's only your layout, so you would have to copy your layout over to him. Okay. So to do that, you would go up to System. I want to ask him to make sure it's all right first. I think I know how to do that. Let me see, Robin. I go to System. I go to Users. Copy user settings. Right. So you would be the source username. You're the one with the correct settings. And then under the name company position heading, you would copy the name record layout. Wait a minute. Okay. I select my name, then I do, what did you say at the last part, target database? No. You're going to see those headings. And under each heading is what to copy. Okay. Oh, under the name copy. Under the name company. Okay. It would be in that first column where it says name search record layout. Record search. I would just choose his name in the drop-down then, right? No, no, no, no. So source username is going to be your name. That's who you're copying from. Okay. Then you want to make sure the name company position records heading is a bit lower that that's expanded and you're going to select yeah i did they're all selected in here when i look at name company position okay so if you don't want to copy everything though like if you're just wanting to copy this change under where it says record search layout select the name check box so that's selected oh on the record search layout or the record card record search layout record card is more like those recently viewed cards that you see when you first click name over the right so i i didn't check everything else if you don't want to copy other things yeah you could if you if you went in here and hit uh select all i mean you could be copying securities and everything you just want to take the select this layout change okay just the one change i just did now yeah right so that'd be record search layout okay and then over at the right you would select the users that you want to copy those changes to oh okay the target database leave that as is as is okay but the name is underneath that i choose his right right okay hit save and then save and then he would have your layout my whole layout or just that one change i made well he would have your name record layout okay All right. If I want to get rid of anything in here, I just, in a custom field, I can delete it. Right, Robin? For a custom field, those are created by you, so you would have control over those. And then once you take it, if you were to delete the field, I'd also probably go and make sure your layout doesn't have it either. Just to make sure. So the gearbox might go to system. I know, I'm sorry. custom fields and then name custom fields. Yeah, those are the fields created. Like you could have one created but not in your layout. I can delete any in here in the layout if I want, right? Yeah, you could delete it out of your layout but keep it as a custom field if you want. Yeah, okay. All right, I think I understand that, Robin. I appreciate it. Okay. All righty. All right. Thank you. All right, thanks. Bye-bye.",
