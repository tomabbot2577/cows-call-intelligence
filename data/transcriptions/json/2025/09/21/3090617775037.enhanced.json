    "text": " Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Hello, it's Ed Wallach with the Wallach Search Group. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? I can't complain. Thanks. So I'm having an issue. Obviously, you know that we're integrated with Orwin for Marketplace, which connects to PCR. And I was having an issue yesterday where when I'd enter jobs in PCR, after 15 or 20 minutes they were not making it into the drafts in marketplace so i spoke with the folks at market at orwin and they said delete the user and create a fresh user and so now i'm at the screen where it says add user and i need the database name username password app id and the api key to get the integration back going so i can get my jobs from pcr back into marketplace let me see what could be going on here. So the app ID and API key, you no longer need that. You can literally just type in the words app ID, API key. We no longer require that. App ID and API key. Yeah, because through Rolf and Sys, I mean, back saying, I don't think you need them anymore, but then I wasn't getting anything to log in. So it's PC Recruiter in the top left. Database name, he said, is edwallachsearchgroup.edwallachsearchgroup, all one word. Is that accurate? Yeah, let me see. If you're in PC Recruiter right now, if you type, if you go to system, Yep. Hold on. Let me go to PCR. PCR login. Go to Go to system. Okay. Type the word API into the search box and then you'll see API settings. Third party API key. Okay, API settings. Yeah. Okay, great. It's edwallachsearchgroup.edwallachsearchgroup, all one word. Yeah, the first part is, like, some people have multiple databases. The first part is the database name you see, like, below your password field in the login screen. Yeah. And then the second part is what you see after ODBC. So, yeah, that's the only database. Okay. Then that's it. So I put the whole thing in there. Yeah, okay. Okay. So now back to there. Then the username and password is my actual PCR login? Yes. or whatever username you want to use to make those connections. So if you changed your PCR password, you would almost like want to immediately go change it there as well. Which I have not. So I'm using the same username and password as I do to log into PCR every day. Yeah. So are you using yours? Yeah, using mine. Do you use admin or? Oh, okay. Eduardo. Eduardo. So I just clicked it. Okay. Okay, so now it says ATS type. Let me edit it. Make sure it's active. Yep, that looks good. Okay, so now how do I – I'm actually also sharing screen with Anson Joel from Orwin right now. Hold on. What did you say, Joel? Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you. But the username is supposed to be app user or API user. And the password is supposed to be what was previously given to you. I am assuming that the app ID and the API key will be a combination of random letters and numbers. They're saying you don't need that anymore. You no longer need that. You no longer need the app ID and API key. PCR tech support says you no longer need the app ID or the API key, and you can just type in the word app ID and API key into those blanks. Okay, so I've added the user. So now how do we test and see if I'm connected? You'll just have to make a connection, unfortunately. Do you know? This all started by yesterday, putting jobs in, and then after the 15, 20 minutes, they weren't showing up in drafts. And that's when I reached out to Orwin. They go, yeah, just sometimes it gets gunked up. Delete that user. And I never copied it. I just deleted it. Do you know what IP address they're connecting from? who is it ending in 95 the company that you're my ip yeah do they know if it ends in 95 you mean my the ip address on my computer no that they're connecting as who would be marketplace people yeah ask me i have no idea and then 95 joel does your ip address end in 95 yeah I wouldn't have any idea about that he wouldn't have any idea on that okay I'm going to whitelist that anyway because I do see a lot of attempted connections from that IP address so maybe I just need to whitelist that the last connection 10-23 you didn't try just logging in as yourself right into what into PCR into Peace Recruiter I am logged in PC. I just did it a second ago to get that API database name. Do you want me to log out? Yeah, log out, log in, because I want to see which one's you. Okay. Log out of PC. Okay. Fine. I just logged out of PC. All right. I'm logging in again. There are two connections made about a minute apart from different IP addresses. I just want to see which one's you. Okay. I just logged in. I just logged back in as Eduardo. Okay. Yeah, you're the 154 number. Okay. Wait right now. So I think it is connecting. I'm going to go ahead and whitelist both IP addresses. But. where is my IP address no the IP address on this again this is the internal on my 192.168 my own system I don't know what the actual yeah I think it's 154 yeah just 154 so there's definitely something connected pretty frequently as 195 about every 15 minutes okay so would that be orwin marketplace that was that sounds like it would be them then and i've waitlisted all right so something is connecting all right so then we have to find out if these jobs are making it into because it was all about putting the getting the jobs to go into draft so then I could post them in Marketplace and get all the affiliates to see them. All right, so all my jobs are still there. I go to draft jobs, and it's like two jobs from months ago. So now do you think I need to still wait the 15, 20 minutes for them to load now that it's connected again? That would depend on their side of what they're doing. So they would have to – Yeah, Joel, how do we get those new jobs I put in yesterday to show up in draft now? Do you have to do something to them, being that I created them yesterday? Well, they should automatically bring it or you can just simply create a new job. That's a pain in the ass. Okay, so I guess let's just wait and let the 15-20 minutes go by and see if they actually load up. If I change something in the PCR job, does that make it show up again, Joel, in Marketplace? You have to make a fresh change in the NPM Marketplace as well. So whatever changed there will remain there. Once the job is imported, you will have to make the change over here as well. So how do I get Marketplace to know that there are jobs that need to be moved over to drafts? Okay. So the draft part of the job will always be the jobs that you create and you save them as drafts. Regarding the job... No, no, no, no, no. That's not correct. I create them in PCR. then within 15 to 20 minutes, they're supposed to show up in drafts in Marketplace. I don't create drafts in Marketplace. That's right. That's right. That's going to be shown under inactive jobs, right? So if I go to inactive jobs... It should start showing up under inactive jobs. From there, you would have to make them active. Let me go to 1018, put my number in. Okay. Nope. The only thing that's showing up are inactive jobs are the jobs I closed back on July 21st. And then all the jobs previous to that, you know, tons of jobs. Right. So something, I need help from some to figure it out. Hey, Ed, I have a suggestion for you. Yeah. Can I suggest something? Sure. Could we go back to your feature recruiter page? Yep. Can you click on third-party API keys? Yeah, let me go back to A. Let me go do the search again. API. Oh, the settings. Hold on. Settings. System. Search. API. Okay, click on the third-party API keys? No, it's in API settings. No, there's nothing. Google Analytics. Okay. Yeah. No. There's nothing over here. The only one is, like she said, the API keys, and that's in there. Now, it says no public API tokens entered. Am I supposed to hit the wheel and do something in there or not? That is your API database ID, which is absolutely correct. Okay. As we can see. Good. Regarding your other part of it, we'll have to just see if there is anything. Maybe we just need to let the 15 to 20 minutes go by. But then again, I didn't just enter those jobs. I entered them yesterday. So does it know to move them over to drafts? Hey, Ed, can I excuse myself with you for just a minute? I'll just call the developer and I'll get back to you. Yeah, yeah. Give me a minute. Perfect, perfect. What's your name again at PCR? Robin. Robin. Oh, it's Robin Montoni, right? That's me. Yeah, that's you. You helped me 16 years ago get this thing set up. and then I recently paid for the year that I guess I didn't get charged for. Yeah. Oh, good. That was, that was not fun to find. Jesus. How'd you find that one? You have a new bookkeeper. Cause it looks like it shows like paid, like, cause it was, I guess like, I don't know, maybe just never changed things as the product evolved or whatever, but they never really had like a, I guess from what I understand, And they didn't have like an auto pay. So it's kind of like you send a sales receipt and we process a card. But like literally one box has to be selected. Because I would get the email every month saying, boom, we're whacking your thing. But then I guess I also never saw the Amex thing that says you've been whacked by. It was basically I was trying to explain it to somebody. And it's almost like you walked up to and I just love to. I have a Starbucks coffee in my hand. So I'm going to use this as an analogy. It's like walking up to Starbucks and they hand you a receipt before they really take your order. Exactly. Got it. By the way, I don't know if these Orwin guys know what they're doing. I mean. Yeah, it sounds like it's on. I mean, it's making connections from what I can tell on the user logins. I'll show you what I was looking at. if you go to system, go to system, type the word user into the search box and you'll see an option called user logins over at the right. User logins. Got it. And then just leave the date range as is and hit search. It's where search. That's a top right of that filter screen. Oh, oh, search. OK. Oh, I see. Okay. So that's what I was saying, like which one was you? So I must be the 44209. Let me go again. I'm logged in as admin. So when you see admin, it was probably me coming in. Oh, that's you. Okay. Yeah. So I think you were the... As a suggestion, can you please share your marketplace page with me if you don't mind? Oh, marketplace. Okay. There you go. That's right. I just need a login page. The same one that we put in the PTR credentials? The login page. Go back to here. Oh, you're talking about for the integration. Okay, okay. Well, I got you. That's right. That's right. This one, this one, this one. And then we go to the GoTerm page, configure. And then edit. See the edit. Okay. Yeah. This is taken. Let me just take a screenshot of this. Just give me a moment. While we've been on the phone, it last connected again at 1030. Okay. I'm not seeing any change on their side because they've connected. You okay? You okay? Yep. No, I see all these logins here. Yeah, AdWalk Search Group. Right. So you're logging in as admin. I'm the logging in as Eduardo. Yeah. So I think you're the one that ends in .154. I think they're the one that ends in .95. Because that one makes a lot more connections than a typical user was, and it seems to be like every 15 minutes. So I think that was them. Yes, I'm trying to find what is my actual IP address here. where are you going to map to find out? Usually you just go to like a website and say what's my IP address and then it'll do a little ping for you. I think the site is literally called like what's my IP. I'm pretty confident you're the .154 and they're the .95. Oh yeah, I'm the 7119192. 192.154, correct? Yeah. So that's my external, because internally all I see is the 192.168.1.1. Okay. Yeah, so they're making a connection, so if it's not pulling something, it seems to be like something on their side. Yep, we got you. Yeah, perfect. The app ID and the API ID are wrong. Okay. Yeah, it's not supposed to be like this. I'll share my screen. Is that okay with you? Can I just share my screen for a second? Do they need the PCR URL or something, like the www.pcrecruiter.net? Because we no longer have an API key or app ID. The PCR is saying they don't need the key. I believe you need to reach out to the technical team. That's who I'm talking to. Ask them if there's a spot where maybe they could put www.pcrecruiter.net. Maybe that's what they need somewhere. Yeah, Robin's talking to you. Okay, perfect. Robert, I'm not able to hear you, but I hope you can hear me well. So let me tell you something about what's happening over here. So NPM Marketplace is a third-party system, a third-party system that is integrated with PC Recruiter for the very purpose of importing jobs. You know, once the jobs are created in PC Recruiter, these jobs are supposed to be imported within the marketplace in the next 15 to 20 minutes. Now, that is the whole arrangement that has been going on from all this time. Now, what has happened is obviously, Ed over here ended up deleting the credentials just because he wanted to refresh the entirety of the credentials. Now, even though he's trying to enter the new credentials, let me tell you that the username and the password and the app key and the API key are supposed to be generated from the backend. So maybe you may need to involve your technical team with this. Or if you have an API team, you need to bring them into the picture. The reason is very simple because this app ID and this API key is not correct. It will have to be different from a certain user's account, which means if Ed Wallach is using this account, then this account itself will have a different set of app ID and API key. So those would have to be different from different database. They cannot be the same one. because everyone cannot have the same jobs. Everyone cannot have the same candidates. It will have to be different for different user IDs, and it will have to be different from different user perspectives. Even though my username and password identifies it as me unique? Yeah, I'm lost. Yeah, I don't know what he's saying. All I want to do is get my jobs posted so my recruiters can see them and I can make places. It's connecting to the database. So if it's not pulling, then that's, you know, he's making the connection to the database. Yeah, she says it is making the connection. We see it in the user logins. It is connecting. Then what do we do, Joel? In the position, let me just share my page with you, Esther. Maybe you will have an idea what I'm talking about. Okay. I'm so sorry for your experience. That's okay. Can you just stop sharing your page? Let me go ahead and share my page. Yeah. Stop sharing. Okay. Wonderful. Let me just share my page. Yeah. Maybe it will give you some idea on what I'm talking about. Okay. Just a second. Bear with me for a minute. Take your time. Just a minute. Please let me know when my page is visible to you. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Can you see my page? I can. I mean, I see there's the unique numbers, which is what I had in here before. That's right. It has to be this thing for us to see, you know, this combination of numbers and letters and this kind of an app ID and the username could be something. And again, he's not listening to us. We no longer require that. Is this something that should have been written? Right. But what she's saying is PCR no longer requires that. they used to and they do not anymore. Okay. All right. So who and where am I supposed to get help from? No, I understand because this is the previous setup that we had and it's working. It's tested a week ago and it was working a week ago. And by the way, when I deleted it, Mine had all those wacky numbers and letters in there. But because your email said delete it and enter the information below, then there was no information below. So I didn't think I needed to copy the info to put it back in. So what's our next step here? I mean, if he wants something unique, he can type whatever he wants. It doesn't really matter. because we're just going by database ID, and we don't really – I mean, it is connected. Yeah, they're going by database ID and my username and password, which identifies whoever's logged in as me uniquely. Previously, I guess you needed the app ID and the API key for more security, but I guess they figured out how you don't need it. But you can't leave them blank either because it won't save it, so that's why you said you put whatever you want in those fields. Yeah, which is why we just tell people, just put the words FID API key. They're not needed. Yep, got it. Now, since it has connected, has it pulled anything? I don't know. Let me go look. Draft jobs. Nope. Not at all. and I entered the five jobs yesterday in the late afternoon, about 2.30 yesterday Yeah, they might need to do something on their side. Troubleshoot why it's not pulling jobs, but it's connecting to the database. Yeah, you hear that, Anson? We are connecting to PCR. Marketplace is talking to PCR. Now you've got to get the jobs to move over. So what do you see? Are you going to go talk to your people and call me back? And then of course we can let the 15 to 20 minutes go by and see if they load in or are they not going to load in because they were entered yesterday and the system does not know to go look for them? Do you know? Thank you. I just spoke to my developer guy. He said if there's any way you can drop them a fresh email, you know, to their technical team, asking them for your API credentials, API ID and API password, it would actually work it out for you. Who am I supposed to ask for that stuff? It should be the technical team, someone from the API team or the technical team. I'm speaking to Robin at PCR. Yeah, but is it even the support? Does he not need to reach out to the technical team about this? Because I don't think he has the details. So he's making the connection to the database. And the development with that is on their side. So it seems to be an issue. I don't think he's. All right. Now, see, Liz from PCR, I mean, from NPA, she just sends me a note saying, you have to acquire an app ID and app key from PCR to input in those fields. the username and password will be your PC login info. So maybe she doesn't know that we don't need it anymore. Yeah, well, let's see. You want to go talk to your people and see if there is an ID or a key to put in there and try that? Yeah, there is no longer available. We said we would manage it. Now we just don't manage it. We just let you have access, which is why you no longer need it, which is why you just put any kind of word in there. Got it. Got it. Let's see here. Yeah, when I said Druid, that's what he said also. The ID and the API key are no longer needed. I think literally any value in Glyndon will work. As for the username and password, that I can't say. Typically, there's an API-specific account in the database, but in yours, I just see admin, Andrew, and Eduardo. I'd suggest creating a new username for them called API user and give whatever password you please. Check off the is API user box on the user screen so PCR knows it's not a normal login. And uncheck, and I didn't see anywhere that, I don't see where that is. Check off the is API. Yeah, what that means, like, let's say you didn't want to use your own credentials to make this connection. Yeah. Like, you know, for example, like, if you're going to change your username, you've only got, like, 10 shots to, well, depending on settings in your database, to have like an invalid connection. Otherwise, your username gets locked out. So sometimes people do just to keep that connection separate. If it doesn't need to connect as you, you just need a username to make a connection. You can literally, just as you could create any other username, you go to System, Users, Manage Users, and click Add. And then over to the right of the username field, there's an Is API User. if that box is checked what that means is it's not something that can actually go to your database and log in like a typical user and be able to you know look at companies names positions just as you do yeah it's just connecting through the api only got it which i shouldn't need to do i can probably leave it as myself because when i just log in and i move the jobs over yeah the only thing with that is again let's say you change your password you'll want to immediately go to that other site and change it to correct otherwise it'll write your username I got you sometimes people like to keep it a little separate so one account does not interfere with another yeah well right now they're set as the same username and login and password yeah So, are we supposed to just let the 15 to 20 minutes go by, Anson, and see if they log in? Or are they not going to log in because they were done yesterday? Well, that's a good question, Ed. I believe that their jobs should import automatically. They are active jobs, correct? Correct. They're in PCR as active jobs. Right. They should be imported as inactive jobs in the marketplace. Wait, wait, wait. I've never seen them import as inactive jobs. That's not correct. Okay. That is not correct. Basically, the way it's supposed to work is I put the job in PCR, then within 15 to 20 minutes, they show up in marketplace draft jobs, where I then edit it and make it active. That's how it works. Okay. Inactive has nothing to do with it. Just give me a moment. Let me check this out for you. And is there a way to refresh draft jobs so it goes back into PCR and looks at them and grabs them yeah I wish it was as simple as that but no they don't have it like that however I would suggest if the PC the PC recruiter team has confirmed that everything you put in there as credentials is absolutely 100% correct yeah okay in that case you only have to wait and if it's taking longer and I suggest you need to send an email to the detective a team I'm sorry to say this but I believe, I feel that the stuff that we put in is probably not accurate because that's not what an API user or an API key looks like. But you're not listening to them. They are in charge of it. They got rid of it. Yeah, we no longer manage it. They're no longer managing it with API keys and API users. Yeah, we used to require a line of every scale. You guys could actually get rid of those fields on the marketplace setup. And that's it. So I guess we should just wait. Okay. Is that sort of it? Okay. Then I'll give it some while. I'll go do something else. I'll come back in. And I guess I can always try entering a new job and then see if that comes over. And maybe the ones I answered yesterday are never going to come over because they were yesterday and we just logged in today. That's a good idea. Okay. Robin, you're the best. I appreciate you. Thank you. You are welcome. If I got any questions, I'll call you back. All right? You have a great day. Sounds good. You too. Thank you.",
