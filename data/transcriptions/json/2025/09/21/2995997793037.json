When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hi, Benjamin. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I sent you an email that has a link to our customer billing portal. If you sign up for account in there, then what you can do is go over to, like if you go back in, you can go into the vault area and add a new card. And then once you get that set up with auto pay, then you can remove the original. I can't take out the cards, so it's kind of better if you do it that way. If you need any help, just let me know. My number is 440-946-5214. I'm at extension 5 4 6 6. Thanks.",
