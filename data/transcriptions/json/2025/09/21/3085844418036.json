I wanted to give you a quick call back just to check in. I had the paperwork sent over. That was signed. I also had the invoice sent over to Catherine Harrison, and it looks like it was sent over early this week but still hadn't been viewed at all. So I don't know if she missed it or didn't get it or what, so I thought I'd reach out. please give me a call and let me know if I need to send that to someone else or if I can send it over again or what my direct is 440-856-0314 that's 440-856-0314 and I will also send over an email to you as well thanks hope to talk with you soon hope you're well bye",
