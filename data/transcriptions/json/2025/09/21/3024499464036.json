    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, my name is Lynn Freeman. I'm with Freeman Enterprises. And several weeks ago, I had to change a password on my email account. I called PC Recruiter, and they helped me update it. I thought I would never need to call back, so I didn't write down the instructions, and something came up with my email provider again that required that I reset the password again. and so I'm getting an error message that it cannot connect to the outgoing mail server. And I followed the instructions that I thought I knew to go to the system, the email setup, and the email aliases, but when I changed it to the new email password, it's still not working. So obviously it's my error, so help me please. Yeah, no worries. I can take a look. So I just logged into your database now. Username LWF, is that correct? Correct. Okay. Let me take a look here. All right, so email alias, let me test connection. Okay. I went through the steps to change it, but you can't, it only shows the dots. You can't actually, it doesn't let you have a look-see to make sure that you've typed it in correctly. So I just did a cut and paste to try to do it, but again, it does, so I'm assuming that it accepted the change that I made, but maybe there's something I'm supposed to do that didn't happen. I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out where my misstep is. I'm getting that error when I test the connections. Let me look over some of this here. Okay. Let me go to servers. Okay, it looks like there's two mail servers. I think the one on the top is throwing an error. Let me check the one on the bottom here. Why would I have two mail servers? I'm not sure. You might have added an additional one. I changed over from one company to another, and so maybe I was supposed to change that settings in two places and only changed it in one. It was working fine after I made the change for several weeks. And then when I made the change again, it worked for maybe a week. And then I started to get an error message. It was like a delay that it didn't recognize that I changed it. So I thought, oh, gosh, maybe I won't have to change it in PCR. But no, it caught up with me. Who is your email provider? Hostway. It used to be HostMySite, which they're the same group of companies, but it shifted over to HostWay, H-O-S-T-W-A-Y. Okay. Let me take a look there. Okay. I'm going to just look up, make sure everything's configured correctly for HostWay. Doing a quick little search. Okay, so we're doing an FL. Let's see. 5, 8, 7. Okay. I found on a HostWave website that their outgoing SMTP server is named smtp.siteprotect.com. And let me see, yours is listed as smtp01.myexchangeemail.com. Did they give you – or where did you find the SMTP server information that you inputted? Was that something that they sent to you? You know what? That has been there forever, or either they just talked it through while I was on the telephone with them. But it seems like when I changed it last time, it was under email setup and outgoing. Okay. Oh, yeah, let me take a look there. So that's going to be the email setup outgoing mail settings. That's going to be your overall database email rather than one connected to your username particularly. so outgoing mail settings will be able to send general notification emails that the database needs to send out like a password reset email something like that so I'll test that connection and we'll look at the settings if that one connects we can kind of copy those settings over let's see to your to your username oh okay that one failed too there let me try I'm going to add a additional mail server here and I'm going to try putting in the host way suggested SNTP server settings and see if that works here so we got the port this five seven okay and I'm just going to copy Now, my stuff will continue to track in and out of Outlook into activities once we've done this right. There's nothing else we'll need to do to correct that. Right. So if you do have the Outlook portal installed, okay, if that's up and running, so your activities are being tracked through that, so that's in good shape, the incoming and outgoing mail activities. It's just that you won't be able to email out from PCR itself without this email alias connection we're trying to make here. Okay. So I will try to get that fixed for you today. Okay. Thank goodness for IT gurus like you, Garrett. Thank you. This makes me want to crawl up in the fetal position. No worries. Yeah. Hopefully we can fix it. But if not, there are people way smarter than me on my team that can actually help as well. So we'll find a solution either way. Okay. Okay. So do me a favor and go to system in the main menu at the top of PCR. Okay. Then go to email setup on the left. Okay. And email alias list on the right. In the bottom frame I just started creating one called new email alias. Go ahead and hit the pencil on that. All right. That'll edit it and go ahead and enter your password where it says SMTP password. Okay. Just doing a copy and paste since I can't see it. Okay and then then save and test or test it before I save it? You could save first and then I will refresh and run a test as well. Okay I've saved it. Excellent so let me hit refresh on my screen and I'll just run that test to see if I can read the error report. Okay it's still throwing an error let me look up what this specific error says. No, credentials invalid. Okay, try entering the password by hand. Okay. It's going to take me a minute. It's one of those crazy ones. Okay. Okay, save. Okay, do you want to run the test again? Perfect. Yeah, let me just refresh here, test again. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, save. Okay, still throwing an error with the authentication incorrect. Does that password have any, I think apostrophes might be an issue sometimes? It does. Oh, okay. It has no apostrophes in it. Okay, is there any way that you're able to change that password to not include apostrophes? Yeah, but it just means I have to change it on my phone, my desktop, and my laptop outlet thing. So it's a – I need to make a note. No apostrophes. I'm just going to have to do it. So – And let me look up to see if there's any additional characters that are an issue. One second. Is there any number of characters or requirements of capitals and numbers, any other things like that other than no apostrophes? Let's see. So the, yeah, no, I don't think there's like a character limit. no uppercase or lowercase required, anything like that. Let's try it. I'm going to do one more. Search your S&P password. Okay. Character. So should we get off the phone while I do that and then I call you back, or do you want to sit tight while I hang on to? If you have quick access to be able to, if you're able to change it, I can stay on the phone and then we can test to see if that was the issue. Okay. Let's see. I can do that. I think I can remember how to get to it. Okay. Ed mentioned ampersand is probably not good. The at character is probably not good and quotation marks. So... Okay. I had several of those. Okay. Gotcha. Let's see. I'm going to call Tom. Okay, I'm at the reset password now, so. All right. Thank you. Okay, it looks like I've done it. I'll keep this open just in case. All right. And were there any special characters in there? Which ones did you interview? No, I didn't use any of them. Okay. That's probably going to be good then. So if that's changed, we can jump back over to PCR. And if you still have that pulled up where you can enter a password, we could try that or I can direct you to it. Oh, good. Okay. Hit save. I'm going to refresh on my end. Oh, it logged me out here. Let me log back in. Sorry. System, email setup, email alias. Okay. Okay, that's still given an issue. Let's try having you put in that password on your original email alias, not the one that I created. Okay. So you could close that pop-up, go over to the leftmost alias, and hit the pencil to edit it. All right, I did that. All right, go ahead and hit save. I will refresh again here. Test connection. Okay it says timeout connecting to server. Okay if we let me just double check I'm going to try to send an email out to see if anything changed between new one I created and this one. Here I'll just create a quick name record for myself and send an email. Okay. Got a name record. I'm just going to email. I'll try first with the initial alias. Okay. Got a name record. I'm just going to email. I'll try first with the initial alias, BCR report test. I'm trying to send one to myself, too. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's see. I'm not connecting. Okay. Yeah, I got that same one. Let me try with the second email alias real quick. Yep, that one's given an error. The authentication failed. Okay. So, on the first one is timing out. That's different than failure, password failure. Okay, let me see. I'll go back to host way. Empty piece setup. Okay, let me try that, just one second. This is a tough one here. All right, so everything looks correct. We have the right email. SMTP is, we've tested the one you've always had. We tested the one that hostway.com suggests. And the one that I was using was working. And again, I just had to change. What happened was they had given me a temporary password. And then they let me know, oh, you have to change that. You can't leave the temporary password. And so I had to set up the temporary password in PCR on my phone everywhere, thinking it was fine, and then I had to go back. And then so the only thing that I changed after what was working was just the password. So I figured everything else was correct and how it was configured. And when I went to change just the password, it would not let me. Okay, interesting. Let's try going to the outgoing mail settings rather than the email alias list. And we can put in your new password there. That does have kind of a different SMTP string there. Maybe that's the right one. So if you're still in system, email, setup, go to outgoing mail settings on the right. Got it. And then I'm going to change the SMTP server password to this one we just created. Yep. Okay. And then you can hit save on that. Okay. And I will refresh and test connection. Fingers crossed. Yes, this one looks more familiar. I feel like maybe we were here last time, but I'm not sure. Okay. All right. This one's getting the same timeout connecting to server. Let me see if there's any notes on that anywhere. Let's see, timeout, connecting to server. Okay, that could mean server downtime or maintenance or incorrect server configurations, such as wrong IP address port number. Okay. So that one doesn't have a port listed. All right. I think the next steps might be connecting with Hostway. I'm going to open up. They have a chat that looks like on their website here. Put in name. All right, you know what? Since you have an account with them, I'm going to enter the chat with your email address in case they go, hey, you're not our customer, we can't help you. Okay. So I'll just enter that there. You can do that, Elias. Okay, perfect. You'll know the much better questions to ask than I would anyway, so. Gotcha. Connecting you with someone now. Okay. Thank you. . movement on their chat support currently. Let's see. Checking to see if there's like hours for their chat support listed somewhere. Maybe they're on lunch or something. Let's see. No, no hours listed. Okay. Thank you. I am seeing also they have gateway support at hostway.com as a contact. Maybe if they don't end up answering here on the chat, I can kind of email them with you attached to the email, and then we can work together to get all the right information we need. I'll give it a couple more minutes here on the chat. Oh, it looks like somebody's typing. Good. Okay. Okay. So, how can I assess you? We're going to say... Thank you. Okay. So I gave him all three of the SMTP server name things we had entered, the one in outgoing mail settings, and then the two email aliases asking if he had a recommendation on which one's correct. I'll see what he says. He's typing now. He says, I will do my best to assist you. Allow me a few minutes, please. Okay. Thank you so much for your help. No problem. Hopefully, we get to the bottom of this on the chat here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, just waiting on some chat. Just making sure it got so quiet, I thought we might have been disconnected. Thank you. Oh, yeah, no worries. I'm not rushing you. I'm over here getting work done while you've got your wife helping me. Excellent. Yeah, I just put my microphone on mute because I was going to pop a cough drop in. So, sorry. That's probably why it got so quiet. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. is saying thank you for your patience and typing okay Okay, he gave me an article about the Outlook connection. Okay. All right, let me see. Thank you. Okay, I've got the emails working on my laptop, my phone, and my desktop with the new password. Oh good, okay. Everything's working except for PCR. All right. So yeah, he sent me a long article about connecting Outlook with this. And I let him know it wasn't for Outlook, it's for something else. But I will scan this article really quick just in case there's anything in there. Okay. He gave me, wow, something completely different than we've been using. Okay. Let me do this. so I'm gonna add a whole another alias and we can eventually just delete the older ones. Okay. Let's do this. So we got the email address. Copy that. Okay. Okay, let's see. All right, so I hit save on that. So if you go back to system in the main menu, email setup, and then email alias list, you should see a third one called hostway email. I'll click the pencil to edit that one. OK. And go ahead and enter your password there. Hit Save. Done. All right. And I will refresh that. And test connection. You misspelled my name. As long as it doesn't show up that way in the mail that goes out, I don't care about it for, you know, being on my desktop, but I don't know if that pulls anywhere. Yeah, let me adjust that right now. And then I'm also going to adjust this here. Test connection. Okay, authentication unsuccessful. Let me double check I have everything that they sent. And that's server data.net, colon 587. um say that's it All right. I can get probably a more detailed report if I try to send this to myself again. Email. Thank you. Okay. Let's try this. It is mentioning hosted exchange email. Okay, no, that's about Microsoft. I don't think they use Microsoft Exchange. I do have MS Exchange 2016. Oh, okay. I do purchase that. Oh, okay. If you, let's see. So if you open up Microsoft Exchange settings, do you have like access to like the admin settings? In my host way area. I think so, yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Let me log back in. Okay, so I asked them is there a place I need to turn on SMTP permission in my account, which we can try once you get to the Microsoft Exchange area. But he responded, I need to verify you as the account owner for security purposes. May I have the support PIN located under account summary in site control? It is 835-083. Okay, cool. I'm glad you knew where to look for that because I wasn't exactly sure what he was describing. I'm trying to find... I was just on here and had... Here we go. I'm at the MS Exchange 2016 area. Let's see what it's got here. Okay. Let me know if you see users listed on the left anywhere. Yeah, I have a display named Lynn Freeman and it's got my email address at .ent and then it's got an action drop down menu of reset password, edit email address, set forwarding, review ActiveSync settings. Okay. If you click on your actual name, does a fly out window appear from the right? Let's see. It takes me to another screen that it says optional services ActiveSync and that's checked. It says forward mail to, not set up, member of, how many distribution lists, advanced settings, storage management. Let's see. Okay, so their support accepted that PIN. We'll see what he says. He might be able to direct me right to the area where there's SMT permission being turned on or off. So what you're describing sounds a little bit different than when I just go to like admin.microsoft.com. It might be a different interface of Microsoft Exchange when it's inside of Hostway, it sounds like. Yeah, usually when I go to the Microsoft Exchange, it'll have a main menu kind of on the left, where it'll have the word users and then active users. But it doesn't look like that for you. We'll see what this support person says at Hostway. Okay, there's a server name that comes up on something I just clicked. OK. Oh, he's got instructions here. It'll say, it says go to email MS Exchange 2016 users. So yeah, you just got to find somewhere where it says users on the MS Exchange page. Oh, he says, would you like me to enable it for you? Please. Yeah. He says it is not enabled at the moment. Yes, that would be great. Thank you. Thank you for making me sound nice. Definitely. Yes, damn it. Right. Thank you. Okay, he turned it on, so let me do a test here. Oh, that went through. I think I just sent myself an email. This is good. Good sign. Garrett, I'm happy. So I can try to send myself an email from PCR? Yep. Just when you're sending it in the From dropdown, select the third email alias from the From list, the one we made called Hostway Email. I don't get it. Oh, wait a minute. Oh, the Hostway. Oh, I see how that works. Okay. I didn't even know you could do that. Yes, you can have multiple email aliases. It says sent and let's see if it's in my inbox. It came in. Awesome. So that means I need to delete the old ones? Yes. So we can go back to system, email setup, and then click the X next to the two we don't want which is called new email alias. That one can be removed. So I go to the email alias list. Oh, I see. So I X the PC recruiter one. Yep. And it says, are you sure you want to delete? Yes. And I X the new one. Yep. Yes, and I'll leave the host way, and you can fix my correct spelling. So now let me go back that we have those other ones, and I just want to see that that pops up as my default. Okay. it sure does look at that awesome i like to be double happy with joy and let me just go into my name record and make sure that those activities posted as well because sometimes i'll have things where emails are going out and activities not posting but they did so everything all right You're the man. Awesome. I'm going to actually reply to that last email that I sent to myself to see if we get the incoming email written. See if that works. Okay. So that was sent. Let me check. I don't see anything from you. You weren't actually emailing me, right? You were just sending an email from PCR? Yes. I sent one from you to myself, and then I replied to that email. You should actually get it in your inbox, and it should write an email received activity on the Garrett Camiaty. Garrett on PCR test 2 at 259. Okay. So that must have been the one you sent out. Let's see. I don't have it received yet. Okay. I got the email on my desktop in Outlook. I can see it, but I don't see it posting to my activities. Okay. So that might be – okay. Sometimes it takes a second for that to happen. That's not always super, super instantaneous. Okay. Let's actually, I just got from that support guy, I have to hit the IMAP settings. That's kind of more the incoming email. If Outlook portal is set up, it will write those incoming email activities. But I want to just make sure that you have it set up in PCR as well, just in case Outlook stops working or anything like that. So it'll be very similar to what we did with the email alias. We're just going to create one called an incoming mail server. and so if you just want to go to the little gear icon at the top right of PCR next to profile picture like email the system okay they look the same okay email yeah select email that'll open up PCR mail in a new tab then go to configure at the top left okay and then go to mail servers. Actually, let me start, at least start on it. So all you'll have to do is enter that password. Oh, wait, they have one started for you. That looks correct. Okay. So in the bottom frame, after you click on mail servers, there's one listed that says Lynn's 2025 mail. To the left of that, click on action and then edit. Okay. And then enter in your new password under the password field. And to the left of that, go ahead and change the username to your full email address instead of LWF. Why are we doing that? The email server needs an email address is actually the username that you're connecting to. It will let me change that. Oh, it won't let you type. Okay, that's all right. Then I will start on a new one here. One second. So you can close that pop-up. And let's do this. Oh, wait, now it looks like it will let me change it. Oh, no, it lets me highlight it, but it won't let me change it. Sorry. Got my head. No worries. No problem. Okay. And go. Okay. So I entered a new one called Hostway Mail. So just click on Mail Servers again up at the top. It'll kind of refresh that bottom frame. Go to the action drop-down and edit and then put in your password. and hit save let me know when that is entered okay saved it awesome and I'll test the connection there that's good good connection so that will take 24 hours to fully sync but after that you'll definitely be getting your incoming email activities. Oh, it's it. Okay. I just tested it. I see incoming support test two at 301. And then I've had another one come in since then. So it's working. Awesome. Okay. Yeah. Everything is in good shape. I kept you all afternoon. I appreciate your help. No problem. Happy to help. I'm glad we got to the bottom of it. Reach out if you need anything else. Great. You have a great afternoon, Garrett. Take care. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.",
