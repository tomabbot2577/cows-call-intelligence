    "text": " Hey, what's going on? It's the PCRM upgrade training for David Topping. It's a litany of issues as to why they can't use PCRM. And I don't know why they were upgraded or sold it. Because it's just like there's like seven issues as to why they can't use it. I'm waiting for... They have 60 legacy positions. This was their issue with the upgrade to the new pipeline and why they weren't doing it. They have 60 legacy positions. They may be closed to a month. And they would either have to enter 60 position records to be able to actually use PCRM with it or wait for them to all close, which they're not going to close in two years. and their pipeline reporting, they can't accurately do what they want to do in the pipeline because we don't have enough out-of-process reasons. So they've been tracking activities, and that's not so much of an issue. I can figure that one out, but there was a whole reason they didn't do it. And the AI candidate match, they need to be able to consider an internal job description and a public job description with the candidate match. And he said that's the entire reason they did it. And if that doesn't work, they are massively disappointed and wouldn't have done it to begin with because they were talking to other companies about like CRMs and ATSs. So he said, if that doesn't work, then there's no reason for them to use it. And while that is, even if we, I don't think it considers the internal job description. Even if it does, they're using the internal job description to store something specific that they're not willing to move. What are they storing there? It's some type of email template that they won't use a form letter for. I told them that we'd have to figure that out. But does the AI thing bring in the internal job description too? I am looking right now. Where are we? Okay. Blah, blah, blah. Where are you? It was just 30 minutes of them just, like, slamming me with, like, I don't know why we did this. Okay. They were nice about it, but... He said it's, like, it's... He said what it seems to be the case with PCR is every time we talk to the salesperson, it's like, oh, yeah, that sounds great. And then we get into the training and they're like, actually, well, you have to do this. You have to do this. This will only work if you do this. And there's always caveats with everything the salesperson says to them. Which is the case. That definitely is true. We know that. And it's also an 18-person office. Yeah, I mean, I've had people, I have two people right now that are larger offices that use it. I mean, the biggest thing is, if they weren't on the new pipeline, you shouldn't have sold it to them without telling them that they needed to move to the new pipeline. they knew that and I guess they agreed to it but it's not going to be reasonable like it's they either create 60 position records and still use the legacy pipeline or they use the legacy pipeline and create new positions as they close but they close to a month so like there's not a realistic situation here where they're going to be satisfied I mean, hypothetically, with the positions, we'll probably be able to do something. But let me look at one of these that's open. But they're nuts about reporting. So that is also my concern with the transition into the new pipeline. All of the reporting that they need, I truly do not feel capable to do this. I'm just very sick as the person who has to deal with them for 10 hours being the salesperson almost lying. Like I'm very sick of that. Because then I get yelled at for 10 hours. Okay. So. So I don't disagree necessarily with the internal job description being sent. However, there's no information in this. Unless it's different in some of these, I mean, I'll take a look. I didn't completely understand what they said they were using it for. I'm waiting for the RingCentral recording to load because I recorded it, but it was just 30 minutes of them slamming me, and it sucked. Like, they're not going to be happy. They are going to leave. Like, I just do not foresee this going well, and I'm, like, I really don't think I'm really going to be able to do it. So when you, so once that loads, go through it and send me what all of their like issues are and then I can look at it. Like adding an internal job description would be fine for the AI match. Does it pull into the AI match? Does it use it? It does not right this second. But that's a like relatively easy thing. or I can ask it maybe does I don't know if it's um if it's in there or not I do want to know why it also just sounds like they're doing something illegal like what do you mean because they did they were like yeah the ideal age of your candidate I'm like you there is London I don't know if that's different but no that's like extra not okay there yeah so Oh, so they want the AI match to work like a search. They want the AI candidate, the thing where it compares the job and pulls candidates for the job. They want that to consider the internal job description as well. It's not even necessarily the internal job description. Ideally, it considers the notes because that's where they're putting it. But notes are like that wouldn't make sense because that's not what the notes section is used for. for or maybe it is i don't know but it does it it doesn't pull the notes section does it no and that's that's hard because people can have a ton of notes like i i don't know that we would ever be able to pull that um like internal job description is one thing um but I'm glad I recorded those because it was fucking bad Yeah, I mean, you can send me the recording if you want to. Okay. Like, Lombardo should not have pushed on to PCR. Well, they were going to leave if they didn't get the candidate match. So I understand, like, doing that. But them moving to the new pipeline and also learning PCRM, that's impossible. like they needed to move to the new pipeline two years ago right but there also was reasons they didn't do it and now those issues have to be addressed and they have to be taught pcrm like it's it's it's a nightmare like this is this is like this is a horrible situation and i i they ideally should have went with a different software. I mean, so yes, yeah. No, I don't disagree with you, and it's stupid that they did that, but... Or that, like... I'm sorry, I didn't... Okay, sure. Did we cut that off? So, no, it doesn't look like it sends the internal job description. So, we'll look at that. If it doesn't even do that and they're not going to do that, they're not going to be happy and it's not going to work. So adding that in, in my opinion, is not a huge deal. Because we would add it to the call. I am a little confused though because... Plus company job description. So is job description not part of the company automatically? Yeah, so I'll look at that. My... I think that... So if they do migrate to a new software, it's going to take them just as much time as it would for us to upgrade them to the new pipeline. With 60 positions, that's a lot. So that would be a whole challenge. I mean, technically, we can copy the position over. there used to be a way to switch them from the old pipeline to the new pipeline, but I don't really know how that works, because it doesn't. I don't know what's wrong with it. So I can maybe look into bringing that out. But yeah, the new pipeline thing is going to be a big deal. But right now, the candidate, I guess we have to address what's wrong with the candidate match. I need to find out what to do. It's a two-fold problem because they can't use the candidate match in PCRM because they could, I guess, because the legacy positions are there and the information is still valid. It's just that the pipeline doesn't work. But they can't use the pipeline and PCRM for those position records, so it would kind of be pointless to use AI candidate match and then I don't know. It's stupid. This is not a situation that should have happened and Lombardo shouldn't have told it. Well, they always do that. Do I just not have a position in the pipeline in the database? That makes no fucking sense. Okay. Sure. I'm trying to see if we can do a switch. Okay. Great. Great. Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay. You see me? Okay, yeah, so go ahead and send me that info, and I'll look at the stuff that they're looking And I'll talk to Bill about the stupid whatever thing that Lombardo did. Like, I understand them doing it because they were going to leave. Like, they were actively looking at other stuff. But this wasn't the solution for them. The solution for them might have been leaving. So now I've been given the task of making sure that this is everything they wanted when it's not. Yeah. So I'll get that put together and I'll send it to you. Okay. Yeah. Let me know. And then like I said, I'll try to figure out what the deal is there. Like you said, it's probably not going to be possible. Are they locked into a contract? Or does the upgraded PCRM, does it have the same like 90-day situation? I'm just wondering. It kind of gauges how pissed off they're going to be, whether they can leave or if they can't. I'm sure that it has a 90-day cancellation period, but I don't know. for sure. Another thing he said is like, I don't want to use two pieces of software. I don't want to be explaining to people that you do this in PCR nine and then you do this in PCRM. And that is going to be the case for them for like a while. Like that is just kind of the situation considering where they are. Other than those two things, what is the other than the new pipeline in the AI match was there anything else that they put in that was like a big whatever um I can't remember off the top of my head but there was another thing about analytics where he said it doesn't like track the pipeline stuff the way they want to um so that was just a little one-off thing but it's just that's a pretty large clear issue that I don't know exactly what to do about the pipeline stuff. It's probably like a customer report. That's probably what they would have to do. The analytics is not going to, like the analytics isn't changed. It's the same stone issue they had before. It's probably going to be the same issue that they have. But. Okay. I'll look at the video and I'll, I'll put something together for you. It's taking a while for this to come through. I'll just get it to you whenever it comes. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. Just let me know and then we'll go from there. Okay, cool. Sounds good. They just have a normal contract, so their part will probably be able to cancel. We'll try to do something with it. Did you have anything else? No. Okay, cool. Yeah, send me that and then we'll talk about it. Great, you had a chance to review it. Okay, I appreciate it. Yeah, no problem.",
