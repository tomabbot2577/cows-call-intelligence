    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. My name is Connie Rose, and I'm with Raymond Alexander. I'm part of Financial Recruiters International with subsidiary. What other information do you need to follow my account? Let's see. Preferred talent. Did you say preferred talent solutions? No. My company is a subsidiary, and that is Raymond James. Excuse me. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Let's back up. Oh, sorry. Keep saying that because it did business with them. Alexander Raymond. Alexander Raymond. Alexander Raymond. Gotcha. It's getting late. Yeah, no problem. If you don't find them, we'll put in Financial Recruiters International, maybe under that name. Okay. I'm in a parent company there we go okay cool so got you pulled up here oh I'm Connie Rose so I'm not sure on your if you see me I'm a new hire this is my I just got here Monday and so um what's happening is as I enter a name which I I have one I'm looking at right now. Across my toolbar, when I basically do the drop arrow, and it gives me all that are pinned that typically remain hidden. And so what I'm missing is details, and that has a lot inside that detail folder. I don't know why I'm missing it. That's weird. But looking here at the toolbar, and if you them share screen, I'd be glad to do that. It's missing and I don't know how to find it. Okay, yeah absolutely. So you have a name record pulled up and you have on the left there it'll start with like edit name and then you might have a resume tab. So that's the the tabs you're looking at there and you're missing details and when you click um you click the three horizontal lines at at the end of that list of tabs, details is not listed in there either? No. And I even brought in the owner of my box, and he couldn't leave it either. Gotcha. It's not there, and I'm like, no. All right. I will, let's fire up a screen share meeting. I've been hesitant to put any more resumes in there. I mean, I've only put two because I've been playing videos and learning how to use your software, and you can put in a bunch of bad data or leave a bunch of data out and then find yourself backtracking. So I don't want to go there. Yeah, that is a good, that's a smart way of looking at it. A lot of people don't have that philosophy and they shoot themselves in the foot a little bit. But yeah, I have a new meeting fired up. So just go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, this takes me to a Google page. Meetings.ringcentral.com. Yeah, meetings, plural, with an S, .ringcentral.com. So it should take you to – I thought you said that. Oh, sorry. Yeah, meetings.ringcentral.com. It's still taking me to Google. I don't understand this. Oh, are you typing this in the web address field rather than the search field? Absolutely. I told you I was new. Hey, I told you I was new. No worries. Caller alert. No worries. I'm so used to just going through the browser, right? Yeah. Okay, meetings.reamcentral.com. Exactly, yeah. It says, oops, I couldn't find the information that answers your question. I'm in the search bar. I'm still not in the right place, I don't guess. I'm in the search bar right across from the toolbar. Oh, so it should be way up at the top, the web address bar. You should be using that. It's where you enter the www dot up at the top of your screen. Yeah, that's what I was just doing. Okay. go to let's see here meetings you put in the with an s plural right yep okay and then a period and then ring central calm okay I'm gonna get it I don't know why I did it before I had a blank you know I had a blank browser okay so if that's working out you should get it yeah okay The meeting ID is going to be 525-750-780. 525-750-780. Perfect. Yep. Here we go. All right. If it asks you about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Okay, there we go. There you are. Go ahead and click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. I think that got the right one. I'm still getting used to... There we go. Does it show the PPR? So I'm looking at the RingCentral screen now. So if you want to, you can, if you have PCR open on a different screen, you could drag it over to this screen or. Let me go back in. That's what I was having trouble with because I could not tell. Let me stop share for a second. It can get funky. It can get real funky. I did hit entire screen. why is it not showing the entire screen let's go to chrome in one second okay let's tell me if you can see it now okay there we go yep uh so we have the uh radima sharma record okay all right so edit name roll up okay and then click on the three horizontal lines to the right of the word feedback there and details good and click on that again okay rather animals are missing let me check maybe there's some kind of permission that your username needs to get in order to see that. So I'm going to actually log in to your database from my end. Let me take a second here. I remember a couple hours ago I sat on a call with Kevin Saylor, the CEO, and he called in to support because he couldn't believe it. And he was on hold for a little bit. And I said, you know, Kevin, here's the thought. I can call them and you can go do what you need to do because Friday's a lead work early day. And he goes, that's right. Go for it, Connie. And he hung up. And I got out here and finished what I was doing before. I've got to hold you. I'm going to really get him. You picked up right away. But he sat for a minute. And I'm going to say, I don't know what it is with you, Kevin. They didn't pick up for you, but I didn't have to hold it off. I don't know what the big deal is. I'm going to mess with him on Monday. That would be great. Okay. So the financial recruiters. All right. So that's not coming up. I was trying to get your database. Maybe financial recruiters. It might be because I'm under Raymond. It might be because I'm under Alexander Raymond. Okay. I'll just try Alexander Raymond again. Okay. I have two emails. So he's got me at both. but I really don't use, I'm in the niche market insurance, and Alexander Raymond is the insurance piece. Gotcha. These don't have databases either. Okay. Let's try this. So in your web address up top, It's going to say something like www.pcrecruiter.net. Somewhere in that web address, it's going to say ODBC period. I see it. Okay. Right after the period, what does it say there? Connected services in style sheet. Connected services. Gotcha. Okay. Okay, so that's your – maybe you're under that company in our database for some reason. I signed up for their connective services as well. I did sign up for that. I think that's what they call it, right? Area or something like that. Gotcha. Okay, and I do see a Kevin Saylor under connective services. Yeah, he's the CEO. He's the CEO, yes. Got it. All right, so that's the company we kind of have you under here in PCR. So that works. Okay. And then I'm logging in now under Connective Services. I'm going to log in as an admin and then check the permissions on your username. And we have username Connie. Found it. Excellent. And we've got names. Custom. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So there's a permission on your name record that is not allowing you to access the custom fields. There's a permission to allow you to read them, read only. Those all live under details, all those custom fields. Or we can let you have the add, save or even add, save, delete. But that would be a change that somebody on your team would have to make, somebody with admin permissions in PCR. I send him a text and say hey you need to reach back over to the PCR to speak with someone about giving me permission Or you know what this might be easier too I can actually email you a set of instructions if you want to forward those over to Kevin And he can just follow those step by step and get you the permission you need Do you have my email address there or do I need to give it to you? Go ahead and give that to me You ready? One second. There we go. Okay. Yeah. Whenever you're ready. Uppercase C as in Connie. O-N-N-I-E. At. I'm going to give you the uppercases that I use. It may not require that. Uppercase A for Alexander. And then the rest is lowercase. and then uppercase for Raymond, R-A-Y-M-O-N-D, uppercase on the R, .com. Perfect. Okay, I will send you those step-by-step instructions. And then, yeah, feel free to forward those to Kevin or anyone else on your team who might have admin access. And that should cover it for you. You'll be able to access details that way. Okay, fantastic. Thank you. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. I will have a good day you too",
