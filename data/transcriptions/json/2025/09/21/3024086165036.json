    "text": " Hey, are you there? Hi, how's it going? This is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. Hey, Garrett. Jeremy? Yes. Awesome. We have a missed call from you. Oh, I have a voicemail here. Let's see. You're having trouble with RingCentral? Trying to get RingCentral on PC Recruiter and Outlook all to work. Outlook looks good. I can see the PC Recruiter tab in that. Oh, good. Okay. When people are calling in through my RingCentral, you know, David, my boss, says that it automatically pulls up their name and everything because it finds it in PC Recruiter. And so he doesn't have to go type them in one at a time like I do. Okay. We have some technicians that call us all the time, and he says, yeah, their names just pop right up. They don't online. Okay, yeah. Let's take a look at that. I'm just going to fire up a screen share meeting real quick here. So if you want to open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And it should ask you for a meeting ID. Let me know when you're ready for that. Ready. Okay, that's 850-392-316. It's wanting to open RingCentral. Should I do that? Sure, yeah, that works. Cool. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. F3. Just select whichever one will have like PCR on it. And we could drag and drop things to the screen, too, if it's on the wrong screen. How do I switch the screen? There's screen two right there. Yeah, you can just... And I'm going to drag RingCentral over into it. Okay. All right, cool. I can see your desktop background now. Yeah. All right. Can't grab my RingCentral. Won't let me move it at all. Okay. I'm going to have to switch to a different screen then. Why won't it let me move it? That's ridiculous. There we go. There's your RingCentral. Okay. Oh, there's the app. It's still over in Window 3. Do you know how to switch to Window 3? You just hit stop sharing and then click the blue share button down at the bottom of the RingCentral meeting again and select screen 3 under entire screen. Okay, cool. So I could RingCentral. Excellent. So we actually just want to jump over to PC Recruiter. If you want to pull up PCR in your browser. Total different screen. Can I drag that over there too? Yeah, you could drag that over here to the RingCentral screen. Excellent. I'd like that. There we go. Cool. All right, so which type of browser is this? Is it a Microsoft Edge? Oh, that could be part of the problem. PCR is not compatible with Firefox. Well, that's the only one I'm going to use it in, so I guess I'm done with the call then. Do you have any other ones that you can use? I've already got it set up. I'm not going to worry about it. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Okay. All right. Reach out if you need anything else. Bye. Bye. Thank you.",
