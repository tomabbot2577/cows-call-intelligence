    "text": " Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Oh, hey, Garrett. This is Lee from, and I'm with the Denwood Group out of Atlanta. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. I got a quick question for you. This is technical support, right? Yes. Okay. I think I accidentally deleted a couple of names. Are they recoverable? Oh, yeah. They should be in your recycling bin. So if you go to system in the main menu up at the top center, and then on the left in that little search bar, type in recycling bin. You should see as a result there on the right. Okay, yeah, I see it. And so you can use the filters at the top to find the exact record type or even use the search at the top right. and there'll be a restore button next to the records. Oh, I see. Okay. When do they leave the recycling bin? Sorry, say that again? When do they leave the recycling? How long are they in the recycling bin? I think they'll stay there indefinitely as far as I know. So I click the restore and then what do I do to... The only two bottom things it says delete permanently or close. So once you click restore, it should restore that record. You wouldn't have to click anything at the bottom. Do I close it then? Yeah, then you could close the recycling bin and check to make sure the record's there. Okay, so if I click next to it and then click the button, it says select next, and I click that, all I do is I press close and it will come back. So it's saying select next. Well, there's a box that says select. There's a box that says restore next to it. Or do I click the restore button? Restore button only. Yeah. Oh, I see. Okay. I guess you can click multiple ones, it looks like. Okay. So I clicked a button. Okay. Let me just double check this. I think I did it right. Oh, I see. Yeah. The multiple, the check boxes are just for the delete permanently, but the restore is one by one. ah perfect okay she's back all right great thank you so much that's great i can all right all right i really appreciate your help no problem reach out if you need anything else will do take care bye",
