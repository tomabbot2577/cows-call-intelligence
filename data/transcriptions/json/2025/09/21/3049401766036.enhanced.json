    "text": " Hi Robin, yeah this is Nick. I'm just calling in to see what debit card is currently close to the craft services subscription. Okay. Let's see. Well, let's see, make sure it's in our new one, craft services. Auto pay is enabled with a card ending in 1004. Great, amazing. When is that coming out and what's the total amount for that? Okay, so it looks like, let me make sure it's all correct here, here to detail your four users. Well, hold on a second here. What is actually correct? I hope this did not get overwritten. went from six to four users is that correct? Correct. All right because this is five right now let me fix this. We had somebody doing edits on our accounts and And I wonder, OK. Do you have a pen? Hold on one second. Go out of here for a second. Okay. Four, four. I want to make sure this is correct. Hold on one second. Take your time, Robin. Okay. I may need to confirm with you. I just have a blank. Now I'm missing from my computer. Okay, I see it does say additional there. Yours is just like one amount anymore, and not separated, but yours has it separated, which is just a little different than I'm used to seeing. I just want to make sure it was right. Okay. Okay. So that, that. Okay. So your next total is going to be $396.34, and that will be on September 1st. Okay, so $400 on the 1st? $396.34 on September 1st, yes. Okay, thank you so much, Robin. Oh, no problem. Have a great day. Oh, Robin, I actually have one more question. Let me see if I can pull this up. This is not a billing question. I'm doing all the billing right now, but I'm trying to figure out, like, how to pull the analytics from our individual people who are doing both. Who are doing what? Who are doing email both, like on PPR. Okay, both emails. Okay. Yeah, and so if I hover over to analytics, and go to my, is it under database, company name, position title? Okay, I'm sorry. What are you trying to do? You're trying to go to, you're in analytics? Yep, and I'm trying to pull, let's just say like AJ, who's one of my guys. Okay. Trying to pull his analytics to see like how many email campaigns he's sending out on a weekly basis. Okay. So if you go down to, if you want to just see like what campaigns have triggered, if you go to analytics and then go to email campaigns. Okay, analytics, email campaigns, and then details. And then go to details, but you might need to change the filters at the top to all. I'm going to just say filters all. Give me a second. Is it under summary or is it under summary or details? It'll be under details is probably where you're going to want to go. Okay, let me see. And then username, got it. Okay, this is perfect. Yeah, because it'll probably be defaulting to your own. So if you want to see everybody's, that'll, because when you go to details, it'll list all the campaigns. But if you switch it from my to all user. Okay, so my and then under data, the only option I get here is database. Yeah, I would just hit the checkbox of all. The database is in case you had multiple databases and you only wanted to get numbers out of one. Like if you had like three databases connected to your analytics. If you only have one database connected, then you don't even need to ever worry about that. because it's automatically pulling from any database connected. Gotcha. So under details, like how do I target like AJ, for example? Like trying to see, because the only option I get here is database under filters. Oh, it might be your security then. When you go at the left, do you see administration? No. So that's probably under a different login, possibly. So, yeah, what they probably have to do, so Analytics has its own security. Do you have, like, the admin account? Yeah, try that. System, Analytics. Email campaign, C-Code. And then from here, I should be able to... Okay, there we go. Now I can see it. Okay, so what you could do is go to Administration, which will be at the left. Let me know when you're there. Yep, I'm there right now. Okay, then go down where it says User Security. So you probably either have next to your name either no user team filters or you'd probably want to change that to full admin which gives you the access for the setup as well as being able to run any kind of analytics stats for any user. That's under system manage users, uh, NIC. No, no, this is actually within analytics itself. Oh, within analytics, so analytics. If you're under, yeah, if you're in there now, administration, and then go to user security. You just say, and then under NIC, that's where we switch it to full access, full admin access. It has to be controlled here because let's say you did have three databases connected, Like what if you had different settings in each one? So that's why you have to set it here. There's no like save option. It just automatically switches it. Well, once you, if you switch it from one thing to another, you should see a save icon right next to it. Got it. Yeah, I found it. There we go. Thank you, Robbie. If you're just kind of changing it to the same thing, it's not going to prompt you. So now your own login will have that full administration option. But then also when you go to filter, you can click my and you'll see users and you'll see all users. Gotcha. Thank you, Robin. Oh, no problem. Anything else? That's it. Thank you so much. Okay. Alrighty, thanks. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
