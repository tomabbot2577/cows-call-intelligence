Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hi. Hello? Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Hi, Robin. Hi. What about now? Can you hear me now? I can, yeah. Okay. My headset cord has a very low wire, And it keeps crimping up somehow that's making it not sound right. I need to go get a wireless. Okay. So, yeah, so your invoice that you probably would have received is the one dated July 1st. So we did receive a payment that was recorded on July 10th, but that was for your. For the other one. The other one. Yeah. Yeah. So this one is actually. Okay. So 7-1 is for July. Correct. Okay, and that is the only one I was sending. Yeah, so because you pay by check, it takes a while to get them applied. So when you get that reminder, if you say, like, I know I paid this check, this number, you can almost ignore it. They just take a little longer to get applied because, obviously, you've got to get it when you sent it and then to our PO box. And it's got to be picked up. We only do a pickup once a week. Got it. Okay. Yeah, we don't get too many checks. Yeah, we don't get too many checks. We don't go every day or anything like that. Got you. Okay, that makes sense. That makes sense. So we don't over August get until August 1st, but July is due. This is the actual invoice. Everything else is paid except for this one. Yeah, the last payment recorded was $710. Okay. And that was for, let me see if that was for, I would assume it's June, but yeah. Let's see. Hold on one second. I want to make sure. Okay. Let's see. Actually, that was for like an earlier. They applied that one to an earlier invoice. Okay, yeah. It is just the one open. Okay, just that one. Okay, I will let him know, and I'll give him that information. Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Robin. No problem. Have a good day. You too. Thank you. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
