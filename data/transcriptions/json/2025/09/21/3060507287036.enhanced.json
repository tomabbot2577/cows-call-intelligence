So my husband brought another pump. So those two pumps didn't have, you know, a power to pump out the water because the rain was so, you know, so big. And before this was raining and there was a kind of like a pool, water pool over there. So everything starts breaking up. while this was working and plus additional pump we opened this window so you can see how the the neck yeah so now he put another pump so we are pumping out we had that vacuum for all this water and I put all these you know blankets and everything just to block the water so we rented the maximum and everything keeps working it's working okay okay I we were kicking can you I mean personal property properties I throw them away they were like a you know type tables that kind of stuff and whatever I have like some metal rubber metal over there.

Yesterday was a garbage day and they were all smelly and I'll go because when they were cleaning and everything I was snapping pictures I'll see if I you know and that pictures maybe some something you know they came up because yeah when they were cleaning with the water and and everything after them you know I was taking a picture. So some of the pictures I already uploaded. I'm sorry. I have the inspector. Do you need something else from me? Because the service, yeah, everything was slow. So, yeah. I mean, I'm seeing it moving along just fine right now. How long ago did this happen? Like two hours ago. Okay. Okay. We think somebody was doing a different database, maybe doing something through the API. We turned off whatever it is that they're doing until we figure out what it is they're doing. It was slowing down that one server. It looks like it's moving around really fast right now. Okay. So if there is any problems, I'll give you a call again. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. Thank you.
