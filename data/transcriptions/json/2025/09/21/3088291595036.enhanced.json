    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Oh, hey, Garrett. It's Doug Johnson. How are you? Good. How are you? All is well. I didn't expect you to answer the general support line, but I'm glad to have you. This is going to be the easiest question in the world. Okay. I upgraded to PCRM. Okay. Everything looks exactly the same. Should it? Oh, no, you need a different web address to get to the PCRM login. Yeah, McKinsey sent me a link. It looked, well, every time I use the link that she sent me, it takes me to the version that I had previously, I think. Okay. Yeah, let me email you a different link here just to make sure it's the same one. Let's see, PCRM. Okay. Okay. Yeah, my connection is really slow today. Sorry. I'm just trying to get to your email address here. I'll just send you over this new link. No problem. Here we go. Okay. All right. All right. Okay, that should be set and then, yeah, see if that looks a little bit different. I sent it to the djohnson of valorpartners.com email address. Okay, let me refresh here. Oh, yeah, that's opening up different. Okay, yeah, very different. All right. Awesome. Okay, yeah, it was just a LinkedIn. Good. Okay, so, yeah, now I just have to go through and get familiar with everything. Basically, it looks like it's all the same. It's just my navigation starts over on the left-hand side. Yeah, yeah, a lot of the same features, a couple different features. I think the main one you'll notice is something called simple sequencing. Do you know how to get to our learning center? We do have articles on everything related to PCRM. Yeah, if you want to tell me how to get over there, Garrett, that'd be great. Okay, awesome. So if you're on PCRM currently, you can actually get there. At the bottom left of your screen, it's going to be like a hexagon with initials in it. Yep, I got that. So if you click on that, you should see Learning Center as one of the links in there. Yep, I do. Okay. That'll take you over there and you have first an option to choose either PCRecruiter 9 or PCRM as the articles you want to look through and PCRM has articles on all the different features. Got it. Okay. Cool. But yeah, let us know if you have questions or get stuck on anything. right and but we can access both databases right yeah yeah so it's the same database just a different UI just different front-end okay but it has all the same information any changes you make in one database affects the other because it's the same data very good okay perfect that's what I needed to know this will be helpful I'll get out there use the Learning Center as well Awesome. All right, yeah, just let us know if you need anything else. All right, thanks for your help, Garrett. Thanks.",
