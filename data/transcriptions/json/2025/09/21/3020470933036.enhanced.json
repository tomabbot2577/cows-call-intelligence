I wanted to give you a quick call, just try and reach out to you and talk about your cancellation of PC Recruiter. Just wanted to see why you were leaving and what was going on, if there's anything we've done wrong or anything we can do to keep your business. I have a couple other details about that as well, so please give me a call. I'm in all day today except from 2 to 3. I'll be on a call. 440-856-0314.",
