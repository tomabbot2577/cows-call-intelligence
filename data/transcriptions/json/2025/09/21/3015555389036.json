You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and do that. Hi, Jim. Good morning. Heather, how are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Not too bad. Good, good, good. I'm just waiting on Albert here. Is Tony joining too? I think we had also CC'd him, or is he not coming today? I don't think he's joining today. I think just Albert. Perfect. Perfect. No worries. Yeah. So we'll take a look at the PCRM product and kind of run you through a little bit about what that does. Have you heard much about it? Have you seen it at all or anything? I saw it on like the landing page, like for PCR, like introducing PCRM. And then I watched the video on your like your learning center. I think it is. So I'm interested to see how it all works. I have questions, but I'll wait for Albert because I know he'll probably end up asking the same questions. Absolutely. Yeah, we'll give him a chance to get in, and then, yeah, we can take questions, show you what it does. It's primarily a new interface. There's a couple new features been added to it, more of a marketing-type thing, type features and such. So we can kind of take a look at that and talk about how it came to be. I'm going to just try and call, and so I'll be right back. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Jim, I'm not sure what's going on with Albert, but let's just proceed, and I'll take some notes. For sure. For sure. Yeah. So to talk a little bit about PCRM, this was kind of conceived several years ago, and it was originally going to be a change to the interface to PCRecruiter, PCR9, which is the current version of PCRecruiter. and they started changing the interface they kind of started adding a couple of things and what it was eventually decided to be they added a sales pipeline like a sales funnel which was a big thing people were asking for also a simpler version of the sequencing piece which is already in both versions so they actually designed it as a CRM named it PCRM and have launched it as a separate logon to the same database more with a CRM type look and feel CRM functionality and a completely redesigned interface. Now that being said, it's going to have almost everything the PCR9 has just in the new interface. So it may eventually replace PCR9, but right now there are no plans to stop PCR9 as most people still use it. But the PCRM is going to be, like I said, this new interface. I'm going to share my screen here just to kind of get logged in and show you a little bit about the basic look and feel of it. So getting logged in, like I said, same username, same password, same database, but you're able to log in through this new interface, which is a little bit more modular, a little bit more modern. So what we've done is rather than top to bottom, we put the screen or the buttons down the left-hand side of the screen. Many of them are even the same. So you see names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. A lot of those are the same buttons. Some are going to look the same. Some are going to look different. Some of the things like the sequences, the analytics dashboard, the schedule, those are going to look the same, primarily because when the sequences and analytics were created, we were already working on PCRM. So it was designed to look the same in both versions. So some of it is going to be an easy transition, but other areas are going to look pretty different. If I go to names, for example, you'll see it's now going to be a whole full screen. You have some search fields at the top, So I could look up part of a first name, part of a last name. So I can kind of go, it'll add little chips in there and you can add or reorganize them or whatever. It's also going to show you a recently viewed list, which you could edit in line. And you also have some quick actions here. So if you want, you can click right into this little three dots. and from there you're going to have the ability to contact them, email, call, SMS. You can add activities notes to roll-ups, submit a profile, so you can do a lot of the actions right from this main screen, or if you click on the individual's name, it's going to slide in from the right-hand side, and it's going to be a little bit different look and feel. Still the same terminology, the same elements at the top, like details, activities, resume notes. Easier to configure, though, so I can drag. Maybe I want to put my keywords a little bit further over. Drag and write extra resumes, it'll snap right over. And then you have this landing page, which is going to be your workspace, which is configurable. And then all of your other fields are under details. So anything you don't have showing on the landing page and pretty much all the fields are going to be here. What's nice about those is they're going to be filterable. So I can actually look at phone fields very easily there. Okay. Now everything's also designed that this is easier to pick up. It's easier to learn for somebody new to the system. It makes more sense. and if you know how to use the name screen you're going to know how to use the company and the position screen they're all going to look and work the same way all the icons are going to do the same thing no matter where they are so it's going to be comfortable and easier to learn okay so that is a little bit about the basic look and feel any initial questions I'm also going to go and show you some of the unique features to this this piece but any questions out of the gate as we go through here yeah so do our customers using it as well as like the original PCR or is it more like would you replace it with it either either so we do have some people that are newer customers some people are using it and they like it so that's kind of the interface they use since they don't know the interface they're getting trained up on the new one and they're using it entirely many people though are still using their PCR 9 and only the people in their office who are doing marketing or like sales would be using this specific version or other people that didn't like the old interface they've switched over to use the new interface here too just because they like the interface so there's really no wrong answer and you could do anything because when you add it there's no conversion it's not taking your existing database and moving it or pushing it into anything it's simply a different access point to the exact same data and database so anything you do in one is real-time reflected in the other so you could have some people using it or give people the option to use either and maybe you'll find more people use one or the other some may use both okay okay and it updates simultaneously both whatever system you're using because if I'm looking I'm going to log into the same database under PCR9, regular PCRecruiter here. Same database, same username, it's all gonna work the same. And if I get logged in here, I'm gonna be able to see my most recent name. So if I go to names, it's Paula Klymenko, but I'm just gonna pull a letter at random to get to somebody else. And I'm gonna go to Travis Masson here. If I look at Travis Masson, he's now gonna be my most recent viewed record. Travis Masson is gonna be right up top here. If I go over into this version, click names, Travis Madison's gonna be right up top there as my most recently viewed. Click off and click back on here. Travis Madison is right there. So every change, every click is real time shared. It's the exact same database. Okay. Okay, and as far as unique features, oh, go ahead. Yes, yeah, I was just gonna say, what's new in here? Excellent, excellent. As far as unique features new to PCRM, one, the biggest one is going to be the sales, the deals pipeline. So you're going to have a new button added into your area over here called the deals workflow. And what that is is essentially the same view as like an interview pipeline, but it's going to give you the ability to look at these different customizable cards. So you can see qualified, contact, needs assessment, contract signed, contract signed. This is essentially a pipeline for deals you're working. So you can put in different companies and you can kind of drag them through this process. within each card you can also put activities you want to do so calls emails anything like that so you're going to be able to set up a specific workflow and you can kind of drag and drop these companies through this sales workflow the reporting on this is coming very soon right now there's no reporting that's going to be released within the next few weeks but you can put your different stages here you can drag and drop them from one step to the next we are also working on some DocuSign integration so you could send the contract right out of here they could sign it and it'll all be kind of included in an integration with PC recruiter so the deals workflow is going to give you a lot of configuration here you can do like probability you can do whether it's hot cold so warm whatever so essentially it's the sales funnel the PC recruiter lacked all these years people were using roll-up lists for it but now it's a proper specifically designed sales funnel. So that's being constantly improved. But that's going to be one big difference. The other big difference is the sequencing. You have the sequencing. Do you use it at all? Like when you go in and you build a sequence and then you kind of run through that drip campaign? Yes. Okay. This one, it works great, but what we were hearing from people is it's a little hard to set up because you had to go into templates and you had to go into the template edit, pick them, test them, kind of pick everything. What we've done is we've added a simpler sequencing piece on the roll-ups. So if I go to a roll-up list of people that I want to start marketing toward, as soon as I open that list, I'm going to have a little create simple sequence button, and that's going to let me on the fly build a sequence in just a minute or two. So I could say step one is going to be an automatic email. It's going to go to email address field. I can pick what form letter I want. Then I can go add another step. Maybe this is going to be a call manual. I can pick what number I want to put in the call their cell phone number and then I can save all. So I can save all that and then I could activate the sequence right now. So the sequencing is going to be more on the fly, easier to create, set up, and use. So if you have people marketing in the database, they could just build a few-step sequence right here as they go, apply it right to that roll-up list. You could even save it as a template if you wish so that the next time you come in, you could open up the list of all the different templates you might have and use that old sequence. So the sequencing has been simpler to set up and simpler to use, and it almost replaces the roll-up list stages, because if I look at this roll-up, the simple sequence test I have in here, I have a column showing where they stand in the sequence. They're at step one, which is an email. So I'm going to be able to look at my roll-up list, see where everyone is, and then I could even go into, and I can drag and drop them through the different steps of the sequence. okay so I can pause the sequence I can edit I can do some different things from there and I can move them through so I can go into sequence actions I can skip ahead I can jump back I can remove them from the sequence individually so it's the sequence is a little bit more interactive because I want off I could just say oh I talked to him I have to skip the next step I can skip ahead skip the next step because I already spoke with them or something about so it's a little more interactive and easier to use so that's the second part that's that's very new and unique to this version. A lot of the things like the capture is going to work with it, the job board is going to work with it, all the integrations are going to work with it because it's the same database. Another unique thing is the ad screen has been changed and made a little bit more functional so if you go up to the ad you now have the ability to drag and drop files upload files or I could go into I want to add a name maybe and I'm going to be able to put in part of the name so I can go in here start putting in the name and then I say oh I want to add a company too I can go right here add a new company on the fly I can go ABC or ABC company I can add that and what I can also do is toggle back over this name I can link it to a draft record so I can link this name to the company record before it's even created in my database maybe I also want to upload another attachment I could upload an attachment there so whatever it's going to be so I can go ahead and upload that and then what I can do is I can go to this attachment and I can attach it to a specific record so I can add a record I can check for dupes I can attach it to the name so I would go down here and I can do some different and link them to a position so you can actually do a lot of different things right from there so you can add multiple different types of records all at once and drag and drop three four nine resumes, some attachments, create some as new records, attach some attachments to records you're creating. So it's going to give you a little more functionality in the add screen. And then some of the display, we've also added the ability to pin information at the top of the record. So if you're working with somebody, you can pin, like you'll see Terry, I've got a few skills pinned up at the top of his record. So you can take and you can select a few skills to pin up at the top, or there's a whole pin area in the main menu bar. You can pin records as well. So you can kind of bookmark individual records or specific skills that you're looking at there. I've got him pinned up there. So some new interface interactions, a couple of new features, all based off of the same database. So that's really the bulk of what's new to it. You have the AI features, so those are going to be in here as well than those you already have. okay does anything change with the um the pipeline for the actual jobs in terms of sharing the pipeline access to our clients uh that is there is no share so the pipeline is going to look and work the same so it's going to look and work just like it always did almost identical uh there's no way no way to share it with a client although that is on our list because that's been asked for a bunch. So we are putting that on the pipeline to share the pipeline. So still nothing like that yet, but that is in development. Okay. But it's going to look and work the same as you know, as you're used to. So that will remain the same. Got it. Okay. Albert, do you have any questions? Good morning. Sorry I was running late there. Good morning. Jim, thanks for doing this for us. What's the timeline on something like this? Well, it is something you can add at any time. It is ready to go. Everything you've seen here is live. There is some additional searching updates that are coming. We're adding an auto match that's going to be out in the coming couple of weeks. But right now, you could add it today if you wanted. What it is, it's a separate link to access your existing database. The cost is $3.50 to set it up. That $3.50 not only creates the new link, but it also is going to give you four hours training on the new product. And then it's an additional $10 per user per month. So $10 more than whatever you're paying right now per user per month. And it gives everybody access to this additional link to the same database. and like we talked earlier there's no wrong answer you can have some people using the old version some people using the new version some people using both versions and let them figure it out because it's all sharing database it's real time change so it's upgraded real time right okay okay Heather I have to grab this call I'll follow up with you right afterwards okay You're on mute. I'm chatting away. Sorry, Albert. Jim, we can pick and choose like a few users to work in this and to test it out and to try it out if we wanted to move forward. Yeah. What it is, it's everybody or nobody. So you add it, it's $10 per user per month. You can choose, though, maybe only certain users get the link at first to give them a chance. Maybe you give some people, you never give them the link, but we can't pick and choose which ones are built. Everyone pays for it, and then you can pick and choose who you want to use it. You can slow release it if you wish. So it's up to you who you want to make it available to. Okay, so regardless, we pay an additional $10 per user for all the users. Yeah, because we can't limit it to users. Okay. Okay. I think that's everything for right now. I'm sure Albert will have other notes or questions for me, but I think that's a really good overview to start for now. Okay. Very well. Well, yeah, let me know if there's anything more I can do. If you have further questions, if you want to explore moving forward, happy to help. And maybe I'll check in a week, if that's reasonable. Just touch base. yes sounds good jim all righty very well very well uh well any more very well have a great day we'll talk to you okay sounds great thanks",
