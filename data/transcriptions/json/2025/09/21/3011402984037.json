    "text": " Hello, this is Art. Hi, Art. It's Robin Montoni. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. So I understand you have some questions about... Yeah, I have a question. Okay. I'm pretty much retired now. Okay. And I don't really need main sequence, but my question is, if I decided to do some recruiting down the line, if I cancel my subscription, would I lose everything that's in there? Can I put it on hold? Well, okay. So there's a couple options. And one, I was going to have Jim Lombardo reach out to you because I can't even find your contract, usually like at auto renews. and I wanted to see what was in there, but I can't even find it because you've been around so long. And normally what we do is we attach it to the company record. I don't know if we just didn't do that way back then. So, but Jim was kind of tied up today and I was out of the office for a little bit. So I'd have to, one, see what's in your contract because typically there's like dates, they auto renew. And then, so it kind of be what the term is. But, I mean, I know you've been a long-time customer. So here's a couple options. If you were to cancel, if an early termination fee did not apply and you just wanted to cancel, basically what you could do is you could request a data return. And what that means is they send you, there's two different files. One's like all the tables, and the other is like the documents. and you could request a download. And what I want to see is the contract is what was the rate in there because we charge $175 for those now, but some of these older contracts have a lower rate. So then the other thing is if you didn't want to cancel it, which would be after a certain point, like we would take it off any kind of backup servers and things like that. You know, we'd send you the backup and we kind of hold on to it for a little bit, but eventually we move it off. because just hosting all those databases would get very expensive for us. So the other option that we have is you could put your database on hold for a smaller monthly fee. And then if you decide you want to come back, it's just a matter of us re-enabling it. OK. And would that help? Then I wouldn't get billed while it's on hold? No, you would because we would still incur that cost of holding the data. Well, that's my point. It's smaller than the normal rate, but we're still holding on to it for you, which is where if you were to get a backup and cancel, we would basically send you the database that you would download somewhere. We would hold it for like 30 days after we download it, and then we kind of take it off the servers. But is it usable for me if I'm not on the servers? No, you would actually have to have that data. Like people get like a data return if they're, you know, maybe going to come back and put up on PCR or they're going to have that data converted to another software. It's not usable without software. Right. It's just the data that would be in it. Like the tables and all the roads. I'm paying like $78.23 a month. Okay. Now, our hold rate is $20 a month. Again, I'd love to find your contract to see if there's anything in there that would be like a lower rate. So I don't think the hold rates usually are because that's – I just don't know. Is the contract being so old if we did it one time? because all those, you know, over 20 years, that cost for us to house that data because we're constantly, like, you know, having to secure it, make sure it's backed up regularly. So we're still doing all of that stuff when a database is on hold, plus storing it. Okay. Because it is on the servers that we pay for. Can you find my contract, then? Yeah, I'm going to have to probably, if I can't find it, I'm going to have to just discuss with Jim Lombardo. I think he was your contract manager, your account manager. So I'll have to see. Okay. Yeah, I'll have to have, I just know he was unavailable today. But I will let, I'll reach out to him and see what the best option is in this situation. And I will have him reach out. I just know it probably won't be today. He got really, really behind on stuff. Oh, that's okay. That's no problem. Okay. I'm just, I'm basically retired, but I have a client that may throw me a bone once in a while and I may decide to work on it. And I'd be, it'd be nice if I still had my contract there, I could renew it or do something with it. Yeah, the on hold might be the better option. Because after, and after a certain amount of time, if you didn't do it, you had a return, which then you'd have to like pay to be restoring it and all that stuff anyway. we'd have to re-index it load it up and so the on hold rate may be a better option okay well if you can get back with me on that or he can then that would be great okay yeah I will reach out to him and get neither have him reach out and then he lets me know how to go about it but we'll get it figured out okay there's no big already okay thank you Alrighty, thanks. Bye. Okay, bye bye.",
