    "text": " Thank you for calling the name of Equal to Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Oh, I can barely hear you. What did you say your name was? Tyler. Tyler, okay. Yeah, that's a little bit better. Give me a quick call because I was trying to upload a candidate resume today off of a PDF file, and when I uploaded it, it says upload successful, but then it says like no text found error, and it's just a typical PDF resume, so I'm not sure if there's... So what can happen with PDF resumes is if it's a locked PDF, that means it's essentially just a picture of the resume. And with PC Recruiter, because resumes get indexed, meaning that it makes them keyword searchable, if it's a locked PDF, the system can't read the text, meaning that's when you're going to get that error saying that no text is found because it's essentially a picture okay i guess i've never had that error before i and i well maybe most people send it to me as a word document and then i convert them to a pdf um well is there a workaround for that so you can save it as a regular attachment or if like you said if you normally convert it from a word doc to a PDF what you could do is kind of the opposite of convert it from a PDF to a word doc like open it in Word and then save it as a word doc and then save it back as an unlock PDF yep let me see if I can do that make sure that open this here in Word okay back here I just want to make sure this works because I got to try and get this out real quick you can enable editing okay Siri trying that's interesting pages like black let me see what happens when I save it as a PDF now see if it looks alright because the word document like the I don't know the background is like instead of a white page it's like almost black Oh interesting I wonder if that has to do with the type of PDF it is if we can't say this all because it's real and keep changing okay so maybe I have to save a copy as to make it back here save and try and save it as a PDF again and I'll have to open it up because it looks like that it's barely readable oh well there we go once I resaved it as a PDF after converting it all right now I'll let me try and upload that real quick and make sure that works well that's a simple enough workaround if that's all I have to do one sec here I wonder if it reconverted it in the PDF when you saved it as PDF a lot of times what people will do is they'll either ask the candidate for just like a different version of their resume or I've seen people just do like a Google search for a free document converter like online okay and they'll run it through that that's weird because when I when I save the PDF in Word as a doc X file the name you know it says the type is Word document but the file name says dot PDF so I wonder if I change that if that solved the problem. Okay, well, I will troubleshoot that. Bottom line is that I have to have a non-locked PDF version or Word version or whatever. You just can't use a locked PDF because then it can't parse the resume. Yep, exactly, because those locked ones are essentially just a picture. And then what does it do with the parsed information? Is there a way to look where the keyword indexing is off of it or anything? So it's just key. You can't really see where it's keyword indexed in the system, but it's like when you do a keyword search in the database, it looks at those resumes. So if I, like, use the new AI search function that they added, you know, fairly recently or whatever, and said, you know, find me candidates whose resume has the, you know, I don't know, agricultural lending in it or something like that, it would be able to scan resumes and pull up candidates for that potentially. Let me take a look. Because I know there were some limitations in that AI search. Yeah, I haven't. And I, a lot of, you know, all the new AI stuff, it's all about like knowing the right prompts. And every time I've tried to use it with plain words and tried to follow, It's got a real basic instruction set that when you first look at it, but I haven't been able to have it actually. If I just said pull up candidates within 50 miles of Rockford, Illinois or something, it never pulls anything up. And then I can obviously do an advanced search and put in the zip code, and it'll do that, but not through the AI piece. So I'm not sure. I'm probably using it wrong. Yeah, so the AI search can search, can't search the contents of attachment or profiles, but it will search content of a resume. Okay. So if I get this guy's resume in there, in theory, it would be able to search the contents of that. Yep. All right, that'll work. I will figure this piece out, but now that I know, that was my problem. I appreciate it. Yep, not a problem. You have a great day. All right. Thank you, sir. Bye.",
