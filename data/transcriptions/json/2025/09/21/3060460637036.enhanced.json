    "text": " Hello. Hey, this is Robin. Yes. Okay. So the billing address you asked me to discuss, I'm going to make it more complicated. Okay, that's tied to the credit card that I use, but my banking information is all connected to my home address because that's how they have to do it. You can't have a P.O. box for a banking, for a credit card address. So what do you need for that? What do you have for that? I mean the address really only place you really kind of see it is on the invoice um okay so what do you want to use for that because when you put in your card details that's kind of like a little bit different but we just kind of base like you're out of state so the tax really doesn't kind of matter but if you want right you know box that's fine no it's just when you put in your card for auto pay then you have to um make sure it's whatever it'll ask you for details then but that's not necessarily where the invoice address is so whatever you want me to change it to i can it's just that for the card itself that's based on whatever you put in i i put it do i do that on the website myself yes you might already have that done let me let me check on that because i'll have to go in and i will have to change it once i change the bank but i can't do that until I can get internet again. Yeah, let me see what you have set up there. Hold on one second. I know what the card is, so I think you have my old address. You probably have a 32837 zip code. It'll change, but if I could do it myself and I could go into it, you just have to tell me where do I go. Right now, you're set up in autopay with a card ending in 2097. Right. And so I'll have to change it again for auto pay. Well, not, I'm not that same card. I just will have a different zip code if it matters. Or does it matter to you guys? Or is it only matter when the date changes as far as like the expiration? So like right now, your card, the way you have your card set up for auto pay, the card number, the only way I can see it is really, it ends in 2097. card number. And you put in at that time when you put in your card for auto pay, you put Derby Glen Drive, Orlando, Florida 32837. So that is a match up to your card. That matches to the card right now. Yeah. It won't next week when I get internet. So then do you want me to email you or call you or? Yeah. Like what'll probably happen is it'll probably fail or something if it doesn't match up. Okay. It depends on the bank, though. I don't really know if they'll decline the process. It just kind of depends. It won't really matter the address on the invoice. It's just really what matters is the address. And it's really not even address. It's really the zip code has to match. Yeah, the zip code has to match. Yeah. And that won't match until I make those changes. So I'll call. When do we bill again? Your next one is September 6th. Okay. Okay. So can I go in and change the card on that myself? Yeah. Here, I can send you. Yeah, send me a thing on where that is. Yeah. Yeah, because I'm in the portal right now. I can get to data. Oh, I'm in the portal. Oh, you're in the portal? Okay, so if you go over to the vault area. The what area? Vault. It's at the right. Oh, what does the vault look like? So we have our own, it's a customer billing portal. Have you signed up for that yet? I guess not. I'm on an iPad. Does it look different on a regular? I'm on the iPad. Well, it's just billing. It has nothing to do with Peace Recruiter. It's not inside Peace Recruiter at all. It's just a billing site. Oh, no. I don't think I have. Okay. It's kind of new. It started in, I think, April, April, May. Oh, yeah. I sent you a link to the customer billing portal, and then what you'll do is when you get that link, you'll have to click sign up to create an account. Okay. And then once you do that, you'll be able to go into this site. It's just for billing purposes only. Okay. So it's a separate billing password and separate billing. It doesn't matter what my PCR login is. This is totally separate. Good. Okay, that's fine as long as I understand that. Yeah, that's when kind of like everything started hitting the fan. We were in a place where there was mold, and we had just re-signed the lease the beginning of May. There was so much going on in April. That's probably why I probably put it off and thought, okay, I'll get to this, like, in a couple weeks after we're all settled. Then we didn't have to move. Then we did have to move. So I was like, oh, my God. Okay, so I apologize. So I'm glad you're resending that. I would love to get on that. That way I can go ahead and take care of this. Because sometimes I do swap out my cards. And that's going to be real easy for me to be able to do what I want to do. Now, what you'll probably have to do, you can add a card. And then before, like if you wanted to delete one that was already stored, you have to turn off the auto-pay first, and then it lets you delete it. You can't delete it if the last one is being used. But that's all done in the vault area, and then you could add another card and then turn that on for auto-pay. But just to give you a heads up, because it's not completely clear to some people, but you do have to turn off the auto-pay on that card first. Yeah. I just went through that with a couple of the utilities. I mean, utility companies are really weird on that, too, because I thought after I left, like, a certain area, I don't want them having stored my credit card information and all that. Some of them you can't even get back into, and others you had to do exactly what you're saying. You have to turn off that auto pay in order to do that to get back in. Actually, LinkedIn is like that, too. It's just like it's confusing at first. Yeah. A lot of them do, it seems. But, yeah, so if you turn off the auto-pay, then you can go over to your stored card and delete one if you want to. I mean, you could always add it, but then you've got to turn off the auto-pay, then turn it on for the new card. Then you can delete the old card. You just can't be deleting a card if it's the one currently set for auto-pay. Okay, gotcha. I gotcha. Okay, thanks a lot, Robin. Oh, you're welcome. I'm sorry if I don't give you a call back, but thank you. You are welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.",
