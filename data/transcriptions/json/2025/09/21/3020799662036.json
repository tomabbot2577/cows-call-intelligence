    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. It's John looking over at Genesis Search Philadelphia. How are you? Good. How are you, John? Well, I just got over a quick panic on something I tried to do on PCR, but I really messed something up that I've been like weeks of working to. But I didn't, so I need your help. And what I'm trying to resolve is I have a roll-up list of 164 people. and my researchers load names onto the roll-up list and I check everything. When I check it, I just put a certain icon stage. So what's the universal way to remove all of the icon stages and reset it back to no stage for 164 people? So what you would do is go into the roll-up list. A minute. You would do the select all results. I did that. And then over in the roll-up list options menu, over to the right, you'll see an option. Drop down? Yep. Set stage? Yep. Nothing happens when I hit set stage. It doesn't pop open the stage box for the roll-up stages? it does not. Okay, so it sounds like we need to clear your browser cache then. I recently did that, but not a problem. Walk me through it. Yep, so in your browser, you'll click the three dots at the top right-hand corner. Yep. Then are you in Chrome or in Edge? Chrome. Then you'll go down to delete browsing data. Yep. And then you'll want it In that tab that opens up, you'll want to be set to advanced in all time. Yep. And then the only box you want checked is cached images and files. Yep. And then you'll hit delete data. Done. Okay. Let me close that. Go to safety check. Chrome found some safety recommendations. I don't need to do that, do I? Nope. Then once it deletes the data, go back to your... Roll up, yeah. You'll go back to PCR. You'll log out and then back in. Well, okay. Log out of PCR totally? Yep. Okay. Leave. The opening PCR, PCR. One. You can do it, open up. Consumer login. Rollups. 164. Opening rollup list, dropping down to select. Select all results, bam, go to the far right to the dropdown. Set stage. No stage. Commit changes, correct? Yep. All records, 164. Commit. I hate committing to things. I'm not a good committer. Boy, it really crawls along. enough and we are good you just gave me probably an hour's worth of work thank you yep not a problem have a wonderful weekend you as well bye",
