Okay. So they are longtime MRI customers. and I had to track down their website domains down, all their emails bounced because the domain's down, whatever. Phone number's disconnected. On Mary Barker's record, there was a cell phone number, so I just called her. And their database has been on hold and it looks like it has been on hold since, let's see. No, past they put them on hold back in October. and Mary said they had talked Doug Barker had talked to you that they were trying to get somebody to buy the database and that's why they had it on hold but that's not happening and they are completely retired. Okay. So, I don't know what your conversation was with them. What do you want to do with them? They were a customer since 2000. I don't know. Do they have any outstanding bills? Well, the last three on-hold payments because of the new system. Well, you should ask them to pay those. Do you understand? Okay. So you want me to ask her to pay those three, but then we'd go ahead and let her cancel? Is that what you want to do? Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. I will email her that. It's up to you. I mean, they're a customer for 25 years. It's up to you. I didn't know how well you knew them. She was like, Doug was in the car. They were heading to a concert. And she's like, so let me run this by Bill. I can't make a decision either way. And so I said I would talk to you. Okay. because she said you were the one you talked to anyway I just let him go what is it 10 bucks I want 20 so the total is 60 bucks I just let him go okay make sure McKenzie deletes the database okay you know the problem is we really need an email that says delete the database you know what I mean okay so since you got to deal with it send them a bill for 60 bucks and a message just says we need an email it says you don't want this and get rid of the data okay and or ask for a data or ask for a data return for 175 feet okay yeah okay all righty i will do that unfortunately we have to do that so I got a bill or something. Okay. All right. We just didn't have any awareness and so we can cancel going forward but the three that were open. Okay. Alrighty. Yeah. I will change the email on the billing at least to this personal email she gave me so at least those are going through. Okay. Thank you so much. Talk to you soon. Bye bye. Thank you.",
