    "text": " Thank you for calling MainSignals Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Ryan at KBassman. Hey, I have an office, Russ Hattick Associates, that is trying to use PCR capture on Indeed, and they're not getting the prompt to be able to use the extension for some reason, Even though it's turned on, I don't know if that's something that's recently changed with maybe just Indeed or if it's a specific site that it has to be. So, yeah, Indeed, we've gotten a few reports that they've changed a little bit their layout on their site. So we're actually, we have a few support tickets open, sent up to our development team to kind of recode our tool to match Indeed again. So it's currently not working on Indeed. Got it. Okay. All right. Well, that's good information. And I can, if you want, I can open up another ticket just to throw it in the ring there so that you or either you or Russ Haddock can get a notification once that's recoded and fixed. Yeah, if you could send it to me, that'd be great. Okay, perfect. I'll open a ticket and yeah, we'll send you an update as soon as it's ready to go. Excellent. I appreciate it very much. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
