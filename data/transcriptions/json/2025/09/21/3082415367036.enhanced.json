    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Teresa with WorldBridge Partners in Omaha, Nebraska. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Thanks. I have, so we recently earlier this year installed Zoom Phone, and I have an employee that's starting on Monday that is going to be using a different database. And when I'm in that database, I try to launch the phone and it says it's not there. So I don't know if there's something you guys need to do. Not sure. Okay. Let's see. I'll go to your databases here. All right, so which database is having the trouble? Omaha, Maine. Omaha, Maine. All right, we'll just log in there. And what's your username for that database? Oh, golly, wolly. TLH. TLH. Awesome. Okay, that works. And I'm going to double check if there's anything that needs turned on on our end for the Zoom phone. I have some internal documents on the setup for that. One second. Okay, I do need to activate it for the database. I see. Okay. So Omaha, Maine. Got it. Okay. It has, yeah, it has been activated for your database now, the use of Zoom with Omaha, Maine. Okay. So the setup should flow normally now. Were there any other databases that you wanted me to turn that on for? If you want to check, I'm pretty sure we did this, but if you want to check WBP Legal, I'm pretty sure it's already set up, but let's just double check it. Yeah, I'll double check. Okay, let's see. WBP Legal. Okay, there it is. That one's in good shape. Okay. Yeah, it's turned on for both of those. Excellent. Okay. And then, excuse me, I installed, I was in his... on his computer and I installed the PCR Outlook thingy. Okay. And it's not, it's still not connecting. Any idea what I might have missed? Okay. So when you open Outlook, is it showing the PCR tab in the main menu of Outlook next to like file or home or? No, no. Okay, so that's not even connected in, I see. Is this user, do they have Outlook Classic installed on their computer rather than Outlook New? Yes, we have Outlook Classic. Good, okay. I'm going to walk back to his computer, so bear with me. I don't know if I don't shit and lose you, but sometimes my headset doesn't have the best range on it. So let's just see here. Are you still there? Yeah. Can you still hear me? Hello? Yep. Okay. Hello? Okay, cool. Yeah. Okay. Let me get logged in here. Email. Okay, so the Outlook is not there. I already installed the launcher. Oh, but I got to check. I'm pretty sure I did this the other day, but let me just double-check. The optimize for compatibility, right? Right, okay, that's good. Do you have Java installed on the computer as well? Oh, yes. I think the latest version of Java would help. Okay, that's good. Hang on. It says there's an update available. Oh, okay. Should I go ahead and update it? Yeah, maybe updating would help. Was there anything else in the Outlook? Java did not install. Oh, okay. I may have to go delete it. Let me go in. Oh, you know what? and then reinstall it. Go ahead. Yeah, I usually go to add, remove, like you're saying, add, remove programs, get rid of anything Java, and then do a fresh install from java.com whenever that happens. Okay. Oops. Java. Uninstall. Uninstall. Uninstall. Oops. Java.com. Yeah, just go to Java.com, and towards the bottom should be a button that says Download Java for Desktops. Okay, yeah. And then probably that same button will appear on page two, and then it'll start the download. and yeah when the download completes open the file and hopefully the installation works this time around now that you cleared out the older version Okay, worked that time. Good. All right, so yeah, if you do have Outlook open currently, I would close it out completely and then relaunch Outlook. Before or after I launch CR? I don't think it would matter either way. You could just, yeah, just close out of Outlook and then reopen it. Okay. It's still not there. Okay. And are you getting prompted for a serial number at all? No. Okay. So we do have a trick to manually install it since the automatic installation didn't work. Let me get my instructions on that. All right. So if you go to File in the main menu of Outlook. Okay. And then go to Options at the bottom left. Okay. And then go to add-ins on the left. Okay. And then go towards the bottom in the center. There's a button that says go. Oh, yeah. Yep. And currently, does it list PCR underscore Outlook in that list of add-ins? No, it does not. Okay. That's fine. Go to, there's an add button on the right. Yep. And then navigate your C drive. So if it says like this computer on the left listed there. Yep. Look for the C drive. Yep. Program files. Okay, so in the C drive, we're looking at RAM files 86 or x86. Okay, and then there should be a folder called main sequence technologies. Yep. And then PCR portal as well. Okay. Or Outlook portal, maybe it's called a different folder. Is that listed in there? I'm sorry, say that again. PCR. Sorry, got it cut up. DLL. Yeah. Yeah, I noticed that. PCR underscore Outlook dot DLL? The DLL file is actually named ADX Loader 64. Okay, ADX Loader 64. Yeah, is that listed in there? Yeah. Yeah, select that, hit okay, and then hit okay as well on the other pop-up that was there. And that should prompt you for a serial number at that point. Yes. Good. Okay. So let me look up your serial number for WorldBridge Partners of Omaha. Okay, cool. So this is a long number here. Are you ready for that? Yes. Okay, that is 376-635-610-0070. 376-635-610070. zero? Oh, those three zeros in a row, the first one should be a seven. So it's 70070. Sorry. Okay. 376-635-617-00070. Oh, take out one of those three zeros in a row. So the last part should be here. I'll read it back in three, seven, six, six, three, five, six, one, seven, zero, zero, seven, zero. OK, perfect. OK, awesome. OK, now it's now it's there. Great. And you know how to sign in to the username in the connection settings. I can walk you through. Let me see here. Login has failed. What's PCR is? Email setup, alias. Edit. Okay, I signed in with Microsoft. When I test the connection, it says it was successful. Okay, so you're inside of PCR doing the email connection? Yes. Okay, but for the Outlook portal, we did connect it to your account with the serial number, but we still do need to connect the Outlook portal program to the username. So I can walk you through those steps. So if you go to PCR in the main menu of Outlook, you should have that tab now. There's something called options with a green wrench icon in there. If you don't see it, it might be that you have to click on, like, see more options, like a little down arrow to the right of all the options. So when I click, I'm in PCR. Where am I going from there? This is inside of Outlook. I'm sorry. Good grief. Okay, file, options, got it. Okay, so if you're in Outlook, you can just go back to the regular Outlook screen and go to PC Recruiter in the main menu tab at the top. I'm there. Okay. And then, yeah, look for its options. It's a green wrench icon. Yep. Yep, I got it. Excellent. And then you should be able to, at the top, there might be a drop-down. It's probably going to be empty, right? It doesn't list anything in the drop-down at the top of that pop-up window. Okay. Click on Add Connection. And it'll prompt you to put in your PCR web address. so you could copy and paste that from PCR. and then hit go once you paste that in. And then choose the database. Right, choose database and username and password. Okay. Let's see. Password. Nope, wrong password. Would you like to synchronize the calendar between the radio receiver and the connection outlook? That's up to you. Sometimes people don't like that turned on, but totally up to you. You want to synchronize the calendars. I will go ahead and do it. Would you like to auto-free activities? Yes, that would be a good one to do. Okay. All right. Now, down here at the bottom under credentials, it does not have a password. Do I need to type that in again? Yeah, you'll have to add that one more time. And there's probably a button that says remember my password a little bit higher, a little checkbox you can put in. Oh, there it is. Remember my password. And let's see. It says, I think, test connection at the top. We could just double check it to make sure. Click on that. It should say success. Yep, it did. Oh, excellent. Then hit OK on that and save and close. I mean, close that little pop-up and then save and close. And you should be all set. Perfect. Perfect, perfect. I think we're good to go. I shouldn't have to go back in and retest the connection on the PCR site, should I? No, yeah, that should be still in good shape. Okay, okay. Good. I think we're good then. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. All right. Sounds good. Thanks so much. Thanks. Bye.",
