    "text": " This is Carl. Good afternoon, Carl. This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Who's the name? This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I got an inquiry from you the other day. Hey, Jim. How are you doing? I'm pretty well. I'm pretty well. I wanted to kind of check in. I got your note from our website. I wanted to give a call, see how I could help. Yeah, so I have a lot of history with PC Recruiter. I worked at a company for 15 years and they use it. And then I went on to another company and I introduced them to it. And they implemented PC Recruiter. And now they use it for their hiring on a pretty big scale. And then I moved back to the company I was before, and they used PC Recruiter. But I'm also doing some independent work myself. And I tried a database. I'm not really happy with it. Because I have such familiarity with PC Recruiter, and I like the newer, you know, the newer look that's more similar to the CRMs that are out there, you know. Oh, yeah. The PCRM piece? Yeah, where you move them through the pipeline and all that stuff. I watched your video, and I thought, yeah, this looks pretty cool. And, you know, I'm looking more for a database just for me for when I find candidates that I might use between the various companies I work for because I have a couple of different agencies that I work for. And these would be, you know, my candidates. You know, if I find them on LinkedIn or someplace and they're in my database that I can use for whatever. And I don't really have that right now. so um but i don't need the full version of pc recruiter that you have so it seemed like it might be a a good idea so i wanted to find out a little more you know cost and setup and you know i you don't have to convince me that it's a good product like i said i've got 30 years and using it so for sure for sure well yeah so um yeah you could so if you didn't think you needed like the email campaigns and the sequences and the analytics reporting, which if it's just you, you probably really wouldn't need any kind of reporting and maybe not like sequences or anything like that. You could do kind of the enterprise package of PC Recruiter, which is just 95 bucks per month per user, and it's 500 to set it up. So that one is our enterprise package. I'm not going to pay $500 to set up the program. You advertise that you have a program that's left, but that's the same price as if you were using enterprise. I don't want that. I thought you had more of a simpler one. Well, we do. Well, actually, the normal setup is $750. So that $500. But that being said, if you've used PC Recruiter before... I paid $250 two years ago to set up the program. I was going to say that. I was going to say, if you've used it before, I'm not charging you $500 setup. You wouldn't need a lot of training. I can even do it for $200. so we could do 200 set up. That just covers creating the link. They throw a couple hours in there, training, if you need it. But that would kind of be a real basic set up of the database, so you'd have that. And it would have the new pipeline there. Were you talking about our new PCRM product? Have you seen that at all? That's the CRM piece, which is that new, not the top to bottom, the left to right? I think that's what I saw and what I was interested in. Let me bring up – let me open up PC Recruiter in general and look at – let's see. PCRM, yeah, I was looking at that. That's right, yes, the PCRM. So the PCRM, yeah, that's our newest product. That one, I could do that for $200 set up and $95 a month and get you the brand new PCRM, the new pipeline, and everything like that. That actually does have some of the advanced features, the premium features, but we could do that if you were looking to get set up that way. I don't really want to pay the set up fee. All the other companies that I work with in C, you just pay a monthly fee. I understand your program pretty well I actually was an administrator for it and the setup fee that you're charging is literally just money just money you guys are going to take there's no setup I don't do it so I don't know what all they need to do they're just charging an extra $200 because they want the money this does look a little bit different I get that, but I'm just an individual. I'm just, you know, I'm willing to pay a monthly fee for it, but to have you pay you for a setup for something that all you really got to do is, it's in the cloud. You create a link. I'm pretty technical, pretty knowledgeable. I've worked with Andrew at your company on a lot of technical things when I was working at my other company. and you're charging for something just because you can. And I don't have the budget for that. I'm an individual. That was the reason I was interested in finding out. Well, let me tell you what I can do. What I can do, let me, I don't really ever do this, but let me do no setup if I can do a $1.15 per user per month, the list price of what it is for the PCRM. If I can do your list price at 115, I'll do zero setup. Now, we're in the right ballpark. Tell me a little bit more of the difference between, like I got it in front of me, the difference between the PCRM and a, the PCRM and PC Recurve. Well, sure. So the PCRM is, it's going to be a whole new interface. So it is going to be, as you're seeing, if you're seeing it on the screen, it doesn't have the menu across the top. menus across the left if you click into any of these screens they're going to look a little bit different they have the same terminology the same names the same tabs but it looks and works a little bit different it adds a deals pipeline so there's like a sales funnel added into there yeah a lot of the terminology is the same like you'll be able to figure it out since you've used us for so long you'll be able to recognize okay roll-ups I know what that is you'll be able to click through and though the screen looks totally different you're going to it's going to make sense you'll see names companies positions you'll be able to figure out the menus and they've actually tried to take PCRM and make it easier for someone just starting out of out of nowhere just to look at it and be able to figure it out the menus are all the same throughout the whole system and it uses the same terminology as does the old PCR 9 so you're going to be pretty familiar with it already so so why um why would somebody say oh I want this instead of your other program what is it what does it give me or listen why why would I want this instead of your other one other than the interface which I like well the biggest two things are going to be that it adds a deals pipeline so it adds that sales funnel that our old version did not have never had so it has a sales funnel it also adds a simpler sequencing tool so you can actually build a sequence on the fly from a roll up list in a couple minutes and launch it so some people like that the sequencing is simpler to use in the pcrm product than it was in the other version and that just the ease of it's a little bit easier configure you can do things like edit in line when you're looking at a list of search results it's easier to contact and send an email or anything like that i think it said it had on natural communication in them too. It does have, so there's some AI pieces in there too. So that's going to give you ability to like do a little content generator. There's an AI search they're working on. There's actually one that was just put in. I haven't even seen it yet. It just was released last week while I was out. And it is like an auto match. So if you have a job opening in PC Recruiter, you can click a button. It'll pull up the closest 15 matches in your database. Ah. job. I love that. That's a nice piece. And that's really been something people have been asking for a while. So that is a big one that is kind of hitting people in this direction too. And do you have to have an NPC recruiter or could you taste like, here's the job I'm working on. I'm not necessarily going posted in this place so much as I've got it. I want to see what kind of candidates I have for it. Can it do it that way, or does that job have to actually be posted within PC Recruiter? You could put the job in PC Recruiter. As I understand it, if the job is in PC Recruiter, even if it's in there, like, marked unavailable so it wouldn't be actually posted in your website if you have that set up, you should be able to just hit that. It'll pull that job description in and pull those candidates up that are a good match. So as I understand it, that's supposed to work like that. and you and you can do if I wanted to get it so I want to put it on a website and do that I could do that not and I realized that's something extra that you you got to work with your tech team if you're going to do that I understand that because I've worked with Andrew on I set up that so I get that I don't I probably won't do it because it's not really what I do I work for other companies and they've got websites and but and but you can do emailing from this is correct yep you can do emailing you can get that set up no problem you can email it up like whatever I could use like an email address that I create and put in there and send it from there yes right from my own like email wherever I want to do it from. My company is called Recruiting and Leads Coaching. If I wanted to do that and send emails from inside of there, I would just use that. It really does everything that the other program does, but the interface is a little less. For example, in regular PC Recruiter, if I wanted to, I could have 10 databases in the enterprise because I used to have a few of them when I was running it for this one company. But I wouldn't imagine you'd do that in this one. You'd probably just have one database, right? Probably just have one. I think you could have additional databases if you needed, but really, unless you had a really concrete reason, I would just say keep one database. Keep everything in the same database. Okay. um and cool um is it is it possible um because i have to do a switch over i've got a database that i'm using that i don't like i only used it for a little while it had some of these features you're talking about but i didn't i didn't like it it it had failings and i couldn't figure things I didn't really want to try and figure out how to fix the failings. And I kind of stopped using it. But I have candidates in there, and they're not a lot, that I want to move over. And then I would just cancel the other one. I'd just cancel the service. And then I'd take, although, you know, it's not a real expensive one. I'm not spending $115. I would then move, you know, hey, you guys, what's the agreement? Can you do it for like for a year? Yeah, that's our standard one-year agreement. Yeah, would be a standard one-year agreement. And if you wanted to get data, if you can get the data out into a CSV, you can kind of map that in on your own through our mapping tool. There's a mapping tool within the system. You can get that mapped in if need be. Yeah, as long as I time it right. And then, okay, is there any chance I could, you know, you used it that you had like a little demo I could try for a day or something just to make sure I'm not looking. Yeah, just so I can go in there and actually touch and play with it. for a day or I don't need long because I understand the program. I can send you over a link to my demo database, let you log in and poke around in a demo copy of the new PCRM. And then I'll circle back maybe with you on like Monday, Tuesday, to check in and kind of see what you think, if that's reasonable. That'd be great. That'll give me some time. I'll have a little time on the weekend. Okay. I'll get it over to you in a little bit. And I've got your email here. Yeah. Yeah. Let me email that over to you today and then take a look at it over the weekend, see what you think, and then I'll circle back Monday or Tuesday to follow up, kind of see what you thought or see if it's something you're interested in. Good. Make sure you put your name in there as well. Certainly. Yeah. Yeah. I'll get that over. I've got your email here through the inquiry, so I'll send it on over. Appreciate it. Thank you. All righty. Well, thank you very much. Carl, we'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye-bye. All right. Bye now.",
