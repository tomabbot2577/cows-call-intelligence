How are you today? I'm good. I had to extend our licensing for the portal tool. Like, we have to manually go in and adjust dates and stuff. So I fixed that for you. Okay. I can no longer get that message. So I don't have to sign a new contract. It just continues on. Yeah. Yeah. Your contract automatically renews. It's just that portal license. Like whenever, like somebody leaves we are or something, we actually have to go in and clear out old connections and it's just a little different handling of that. But on yours, we just had to push the date out. So that's all adjusted. All right. Thank you so much for doing that for me. You are welcome. Anything else? No, I am good. Thank you so much for your quick response. Oh, no problem. Have a great week. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
