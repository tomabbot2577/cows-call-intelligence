    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Recognize your voice. Larry Dicker. Hi. How are you? I'm doing well. God, we go back to 2005. Yeah. Yeah. How have you been? Pretty good. Good. Pretty good. I have a problem here on an email. And, you know, last time it happened, the tech person cleaned out the cash. but that was only a week ago or maybe two weeks ago so I can't figure it out well like what's going on is it that I'm looking at an email and I want to respond to it so I went to hit the arrow to respond and what I end up with is this little bitty window yeah you're going to have to clear cash sometimes like if you restart your computer or things like that things like just automatically get cleared out so if you don't really do that or fully exit your browser sometimes it kind of just keeps stuff um it only this is this is literally a week or two ago yeah but it could be if like we're pushing updates sometimes what happens is your browser tries to remember things about pages so that they kind of load faster. So when there's things like updates going on, sometimes that causes a little conflict. What do you suggest I do? So if you are in your browser, are you using Chrome? Yeah. Okay. If you go to the three vertical dots. Right. Okay. Can you hear me now? Now I can, yeah. Okay, sorry. My headset. Hold on, Robin. I keep saying I've got to get a new one. Yeah, let me call you back because I'm on the line. I'm on the line. I'll call you back. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Robin. I'm back. Okay. Let's see. Okay, so go to the three vertical dots at the top right of Chrome. And go down to delete browsing data. Keep browsing data, right. Make sure the time range says all time. like if it says only like last hour 24 hours make sure it says all time well i don't have that here what i have is a little window that says browsing history delete uh including the search box cookies and other data and and cache items and files so when you clicked on the three vertical dots at the top right of chrome did you go to delete browsing data yeah And it should pop up a window. A window pops up called delete. Delete browsing data, right. Okay, so then right below that it should say time range. Oh, okay, I got you. Okay, make sure that says all time. All time, okay. Uncheck browsing history cookies if they are selected. I only want you to delete cached images and files. Okay. and then hit delete data okay so then what you're going to want to do is fully exit Chrome after this stops spinning right yeah it's probably removing them still so maybe if you last did it maybe you didn't have it set to all time and maybe there's something that's why when you do do it I don't know I had assistance on that the last time. Okay. It said freeze up to 177 megabytes. Okay. All right, now it stopped and now it says Chrome found some safety recommendations for your review and then privacy and security, third-party cookies, blah, blah, blah. Okay, so that's the behind screen. So that pop-up screen removed, then we're good. So what you're going to want to do is go to the three vertical dots in Chrome and select exit. Uh-huh. And then go ahead and once you fully exit Chrome, go back to Chrome and then go back to your database and you should be good. Oh, it says leave, leave site. referring to. What do you call it? DC recruiter. I could leave that and then go back. Yeah. Completely shut down your browser. Shut down the computer? No, just the browser. How would I do that? Leave? Okay, I left. Yeah, okay. I think I left the browser. Can I go back to PC Recruiter? Yes. No, it's not opening. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Thank you. Yep, work like a chum. Thank you, Robin. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. All right, thanks. Thanks. Bye.",
