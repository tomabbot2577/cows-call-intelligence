    "text": " Thank you for calling me Antigones Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Oh, yeah. Hey, Garrett. This is Annie from Triumph Staffing. Joe Dispoto is having problems with, you know, when he adds a new position, everything is not how it used to be. Like, we used to have perm fees and offerings on the one column with the fee. and his has changed. So I don't know what to tell him. I mean, I don't know how he can fix it. I was wondering if you can do a screenshot with him if I get him on the line. Yeah. Does he have admin permissions? No, no. Okay. Okay. So yeah, there's two ways to remedy it. He can go in and manually change his record layout to include the fields he wants to see or an admin user can copy one user's layout over to his username's layout. If somebody has it the way it should look. Yeah, well, do you want to come into my computer and then we can figure it out? Sure, yeah. Yeah, no problem. Let me start up a screen share here. All right, yeah. just go to a new tab go to meetings that ring central.com what's the ID ID is seven five eight seven four one six six six Awesome. And if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Awesome. I can see that. All right. So do you know of a username who has the correct set of fields? That would be me. Perfect. Okay. So you can go up to System in the main menu up at the top. And then on the left, go to Users. That's the first. It's the top one there. There we go. Users, and then Copy User Settings on the right. In the left panel at the top left there's a drop down it says admin right now switch that to your username. Okay and then the heading below that that says name company position records you want to check the box next to position in the first column. So that'll copy the position record layout. And then on the right, go ahead and select the username that you want to copy your position record layout to. Perfect. Hit save. Yep. And that user will probably have to log out of PCR and log back in to see those changes. Okay. Hold on. Let's get him on the phone just in case. Okay. Hold on. Hey, Joe, Garrett's on the line with us from PCR. Do us a favor, log out of PCR, log back in, and then pretend you're doing another position, okay? Okay. It should be okay now. One second, I'll take care of that. Sorry, it's loading. Okay. No, it's still messed up. Huh? Garrett? Right. So are you seeing the same thing that Annie's seeing? There's a layout that she had on her position records that we just copied over to your position record layout. No, what I'm seeing is the record layout that I sent to her because I wasn't seeing her layout. The layout that she sent me was the one that was normally the layout I've had for however long we've had you guys. and then for some reason today's layout is completely different. Garrett, could you do me a favor? Take a screenshot of this and then we'll get you to log into Joe's PCR. Okay. Let me take a screenshot here. Let's figure it out. This is what it's supposed to look like. Okay. Got it. So, yeah, have Joe just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Go ahead, Joe. This is meeting ID or personal link, can you? Awesome. Yeah, the meeting ID is 758-741-666. Okay. Enter my name, so just put my name? Yeah. Perfect. If it asks about joining with audio, if you can hear me all right on the phone, that's fine. We could just say continue without audio. Yeah, but there's also a camera, which we don't need, right? Right, yeah. You could just hit allow on anything and then just mute the camera if it turns on. That's fine. But basically we'll just need you to click on the blue share button down at the bottom and then select your entire screen up at the top. And you said don't join audio by computer, correct? Right, that's fine. Yeah, we can just use the audio over the phone. Audio, okay. I'm in, so I see Annie's screen. Okay, yeah, just click the blue share button down at the bottom of the RingCentral meeting and select entire screen up at the top. Okay. Awesome. I hit enter. Oh, yeah, just click on screen one or, you know, whatever screen you want to highlight it and select it, and then hit share. Okay. Hold on. Let me make sure I do that. Okay. So I'm going to hit screen one, share. Awesome. I can see that. All right, go ahead and jump back to PC Recruiter. And let's see. So we've got position details, record information. Yeah, it does look a little different still. Go ahead and close this out. I'm going to just repeat those steps, Annie, with your permission to try to copy those again from your username. Is that all right? Yeah. All right. And which database are you in? Triumph. Okay, yeah, let's go to... Joe, if you click on an old one, not the one that you put in today, does it look the same? So, yeah, that's the thing. When I went back into the job I created, that's where I found the percentage. But when I went to create the job, it's not even there. when I went back into the job after I saved it and emailed it it looked like the same it was just the initial screen you know putting it all in the initial process so you're saying when you go to the add wizard the like the lightning bolt at the top right to add a new position that's when it's no no no so no so whenever I go into I'm sure like I do it my way I go under positions under the firm and then you hit the little plus sign oh yeah yeah okay so that's where the problem is once you see i don't know if you guys can still see my screen but see like yes jobs here if i click on those which i'm going to just click for example i'll click on the one that i just created um which i can't remember oh there it is wait it's this one right it's hidden by Okay. Hold on. All right. So if I click on this, now this, right, is completely different than – so see, look at this one right here. Right. And when I open the other one, now everything's changed again. So I don't know what's going on. it's supposed to have like see how everything all of this is different than it used to be and I don't know why would it be on his personal settings there I haven't touched or changed no I know but hold on we made a change before we got on the oh go ahead so see like this older job that I just opened up this is how it's supposed to look with the fee percentage up here the guarantee, the salaries, all this stuff right but when I open up the job I just created it looks the same right the percentage over here and all but then when I go to create the job if I just go to create a job like this then this is all different see there's no percentage the fees are actually in the middle they're not even on the right over here right and then there's no percentage here like this whole thing is completely different looking Right, okay, I see what you're saying. Let me take a look at that. Go to users, settings. I did that copy again. Annie, if you are on PCR and you go to add a position, I'm wondering what your screen looks like. Is that what I did a screenshot of? Yeah, you did. Oh, okay. Got it. Let me go to another company and try it. Okay. Joe does it prompt you to select a pipeline no I mean no because when I create a new job I just go into positions and I hit the plus sign and when I hit the plus sign it just brings up the new job order oh yeah the select pipeline for this position. And I would just hit select. Yeah, mine is the same. I just went on to another company. Yeah, Triumph Pipeline Primary. And you select that. Yeah, mine is... Okay, now it looks normal again. Hello, can you hear me? Yeah. So now I just want to go create a job and it looks normal again. Like it's supposed to. That's how it's supposed to look? this is how it's supposed to look. Good. Okay, yeah, I just recopied everything from Annie Gordon over to your username. Go to the, I guess, the position. Did you have a position that you pulled up that it didn't look right in that list? No. So, no, the problem is that once they were in, they were looking right. It was more of an initial. But now I just went to book, like, a new job order. Yeah. A new one, and it's looking like it's supposed to with, like, the. Good, okay. All the fee stuff over here, the data codes are in the middle. This is how it's supposed to look. Okay. Good, okay. Garrett, maybe I didn't save it or something. Maybe that's why I didn't copy. Possibly. Yeah, I thought you did, but, yeah, I redid it one time, and maybe it just took a few minutes to load that change, so I'm glad it's working now. Yeah, if you notice anything else strange with that where certain ones are appearing wrong or something, just let us know. We'll continue to investigate. Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks. Bye. No problem. Have a good one. Bye. Bye.",
