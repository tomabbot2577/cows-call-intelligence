    "text": " Hello, this is Scott speaking. Can you hear me? Okay. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. Okay. I don't know what happened there. All right, let me move my mouse around here. Okay. Too many wires. Okay. so when we switched you over to our new billing like yeah which was kind of like end of March beginning of April what we did is we switched people from sales receipt which was not probably the best way to handle things but they didn't have really have auto pay so it's really it was going on it's like yeah we had a card stored and was sending you a receipt but the transaction wasn't being processed for a period of time there it's like probably like literally checking one box that was overlooked so that's kind of what it's probably just very manual to do things that way which is one of the reasons why we upgraded the system so i know you wrote your message like till today your actual your recent ones actually were paid the ones since march so it's just the ones that remember okay did it come under a different name because we looked in our credit cards and didn't see it. Let's see. Let me see here. Okay. Sleep solution. Yeah. It might be a different card than was stored. Let me see if I can tell. Yeah, tell me the last four. Here, the last four are fine. for, let's see, April, May, June, and July have all processed. Yeah. And, hold on one second because I've got two places I have to look this up now. So now they are processing with a card. Let's see. Oh, I'm going to go this way. Here with me one second. Okay. So right now they're processing with a card ending in 6801. That is correct. Okay. But I haven't seen them, and it's for 190? Your previous ones were 190. Let's see. Why is that different there? Invoice 190. Hold on one second. Let me see here. invoice, invoice. Yeah, your amounts are $190. Okay. Yeah, so your recent ones, I mean, they're showing as paid. So these should all be fine. So let me look up one of the last ones I have. Yeah, the last one was on July 11th of 2025. I don't think I have my July statement yet. The last statement I'm seeing, hold on, let me do a search. Our controller sends them to me. And the last statements I have from him are from May. So I need to ask him for the July statements. They come at the end of the month for us. Okay. It will be the end of June, but let me open up the May one for the 6-8-0-1. Now, that one was in May. It was May 15th. Now, that one was 2-15 because then it was a late charge on that one. Yeah, there was like a little extra charge on that one because when did they do that, though? May 15 was 215. Okay, and let me go back because I had our office administrator look at these. Yeah, she didn't see that one on there. So let me go now to our April statement. Because even I looked at these last night and I didn't see them. And you know what it was for me? I was looking at, I believe I was looking at an earlier date, not the 15th. Yeah, there's nothing on my credit card showing for the 15th. Of what month? April 15th. April 15th. Okay, so the April and May invoices were probably paid a little bit later. Let's see. Because they were invoices. Yeah, and I'm looking for 190. Yeah, there was a payment in May, another payment ended, and then two payments at the end of June. Oh, two payments for the end of June. Yeah, so you had your April and May invoices that were sent with the new system, but only one payment was made on May 15th, and that was applied to your April. So you kind of were like one month behind, and then when you made two payments at the end of June, that meant you were current for those ones generated from the new system. and then what dates do you have for those? Those payments were made June 25th yeah and they were $190 yeah those were $190 and one was $215 those were for your May and June invoices so you made two payments in June one for May one for June okay so now the question is is that I remember making those payments now that you, at least the ones in June. But did those come as an email to me saying, hey, click here to pay it? Yes. So that was from our, so we, what we did is anybody that used to be a sales receipt, because that was a horrible setup, but apparently for invoices, there was no auto pay. So what's happening is basically you were getting a receipt when it was kind of like an auto pay before, before a card was even attempted. And so we always had to like chase people down like, oh, your card was declined or it didn't process, like it expired. So it was a real pain. So now with this new system, we can have everybody on an invoice and you can now have that view and pay option. so i believe what probably happened is when you got major payment in june it set you up for auto pay which is why your june your july 11th invoice was sent and then it processed that day so you're really back on auto pay now in our new system it's just that when you were first getting those invoices you probably didn't like go in right away or set up auto pay right away from the new system so it didn't do it. Now the issue is with the old system where for a little bit of time there we had your card stored but it was sending you a receipt but it was never even attempting the card. Okay so that's what the email was about. Yeah so let me go back and ask you. Yeah so from April on you're fine. Yeah you are completely current. So when I get a statement from you it says thank you for your payment and your new payment portal is here. That's what I recall seeing. And then that allows you to go into the view. Yeah, you created an account there. Have you created an account yet? Well, let me see. Yeah, it looks like it. Let me log in to see. Okay. Because I was looking under the, for my, I went to my recruiter and I said, let me look and see your screen if I can see where the, any invoicings are. And this is why it's different. And I do now remember I went in and I looked at the invoices and the history and the profile. There was no history at the time. Yeah. But now I see. Yeah, the only things that are going to be in the new portal is anything that was open at the time that this was set up or anything that was going to be billed. So anything that was a sale with the receipt and process is not going to be in there or any historical stuff. Yeah, so what I'm seeing is I'm seeing the June payment I made and the July payment. Yeah. Now my question is, are those automatically set up for payment? Yes. Okay. So, and where would I see that in the? So, you will automatically get emails. Yeah, you'll automatically get emails. And then in the invoice area, let's say if it's already paid, I think there's like a filter you can see, like open or paid. I think by default it shows just the open one. Yeah, there's a mean goal. Yeah, and the other thing that's nice about this new billing portal is over at the right side, like let's say you decide I want to change my card or I know it's about to expire. You don't have the hassle of calling us, filling out some silly form, and you can actually go in there and say, I need to swap out my card and add a new one, delete the old one. You can now manage that yourself. Okay. So that's pretty cool. So for the one set where the sales receipt, what we would need to do is we don't have it created yet because we wanted to first ask, do you want like a one time that we just go ahead and do it? Do you want it spread over three months or? Let's go back to that email because I just want to make sure we're on the same page. By the way, the one that you got on the 15th of May, which was for the April invoice. That was for April. That's not showing up in your new system, right? Was that the old system? No, that should be in there, I believe. Yeah. It's showing as an invoice. So invoice 220008. That's generated from the new system. Yeah, and I don't see it in the history at all. All I see is those three that we talked about earlier, June and July. And then at the bottom, you know, there's a little place for me to go. The next page, there's only three records. So as long as you're good. Yeah, that one's not showing. Give me that invoice number again, so maybe I can just search by ID and see if it shows up anyways. 2201-484. Okay, I'll look after the call to see if I can find that one. All right, now let's go back then to your email of yesterday. and so you're showing 190 through the mark of 25 yes from August to March that's where the problem when the problem happens yeah it literally looks like paid like even when the accounting person brought it up or like were you seeing that. She goes, if you look at other ones, when you look at the, you actually have to open it up because it just shows us page. She goes, you'll see like no card is processed. It just basically sends the receipt but there's no card processed. I'm like, oh. So, these are not fun emails and calls to be having, I'm sure. That vendor really screwed you over. It's just, yeah, it's, we're too big. We're too big for that. yeah so yeah um let's do it as a one-time payment okay so i'll do one now do you want me to do it as auto pay so it just processes or do you want me to put like net 15 so you can at least see it and then yeah let's do that let's do that because that would be better so and then i so you're my second person it's only a handful of people i have to do this but what I've been doing in the invoice for your records is I'm going to list each invoice as a line item and I'll put a little note so that way if you tell your accountant why you get this other invoice like this is going to replace that so I will get that over to you now and then you can either you know review it and then go and say yeah go ahead and pay it now otherwise if I do it like because you have the auto pay on if I do it like 10 days it'll just process that but at least that gives you a little time to take a peek at it. Yeah, let's do that. Let's have it pay in 10 days. Okay. And I'll take care of it. Now, in the profile, you have us listed as Leap Solutions Group LLC. Okay. We were purchased in March of 24, and we have a slightly different name. Can I Correct it there, and that will go through in your whole system. I don't know if it'll let you. What is the name now? It's GPIA Leap Solutions LLC. That's our legal name. We operate under Leap Solutions. Okay, wait. Hold on one second. Let me do it. Yeah. Because I've got to do it in one second. Leap Solutions. It's GPIA Leap Solutions, LLC. GPIA? Uh-huh, all caps. G as in George, P as in Peter, I as in Igloo, A as in Alaska, Leap Solutions, LLC. Okay. okay all right that's simple enough I can do that okay me all right so what I will do is I am going to get the I'll work on getting this you know detailed enough to explain and then I will get that over to you okay all right all I will get to work on that. All right. That takes care of us then, right? All right, yes. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Thanks for reaching out. Appreciate it. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
