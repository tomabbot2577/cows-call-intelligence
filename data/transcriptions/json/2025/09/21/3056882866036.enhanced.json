    "text": " Colleague Main Sequence Technology, this is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi there. I was wondering if I could get some help with setting up like linking my email to PCR. Yeah, what company are you with so I could get you pulled up here? It's Summit Employment. All righty, just a second here. And were you setting up the Outlook portal or like the IMAP within PCRecruiter itself? I'm not sure I just know that I need to link my email and then I believe also RingCentral to PCR. Okay let me see here. So with the RingCentral, let me check to see if your admin has done their part yet. What's your username in the database? For PCR? Yes. Hold on a second. at Seawalker. Okay. So your admin hasn't done their part for the RingCentral, so they would need to do part on their end first for that. Okay. Will they automatically know what needs to be done? I'll send you over the instructions to give. Okay. And that'll include what you need to do on your end as well. Okay. But we can't just go in and change user settings. Mm-hmm. So an admin at your office will have to do that part. Okay. Let me just take a look here at how these other people are set up with email. That will give us a good indication of what we're trying to set up. All right. checking one more user to be sure here. Okay, so it looks like you are using the Outlook portal. Do you have the classic Outlook installed on your computer? I believe I do, yes. Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is just start up a video meeting here, then I'll send you a link to join via email. Okay. We can hop on a screen share and I can walk you through that setup process. Then what is a good email address for you? Okay it's Callie, C-A-L-L-I-E, at Summit Employment. Perfect. All right, I just sent you over that meeting link. I'm also going to email you over the setup instructions for RingCentral that your admin will need. If you see like computer audio and video you could just exit out of it since we're already on the phone here. Okay. Okay. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share you'll want to share your entire screen it's okay I think it yep it's coming over now perfect all right you go ahead ahead and minimize RingCentral. Okay. Oh it looks like you only shared that window and or that application and not the entire screen. So go ahead and hit the stop share. Then under entire screen you should if you have multiple screens you'll see a few different options. You'll just click on one of the screens preferably the one that you have Outlook on and then yep perfect all right so yeah the first thing we're gonna do is make sure that you have the Java and launcher installed so go ahead and open up and okay go ahead go ahead and open up a new tab you go to PC recruiter net and then you can do the PC recruiter downloads that pops up. Oh, that works too. Go to technical info, then downloads. We're going to scroll about three-quarters of the way down the page here where it says PCR launcher click on the where it says PC exe we're just going to leave that there for one second before opening it and then go to where it says Java Amazon Coreto over on the left then go ahead and scroll down okay then in that platform box go ahead and scroll up a little you'll see that there's that other scroll down go ahead and scroll down just a little bit there that where it says that Windows x86 you're going to click that link next to where it says JDK to the right of it yep yep we're going to run that one first okay so open Yep. The top one here. Yep. Then you might see something pop up asking if it's okay to make changes. You'll just hit yes. Okay. Install. Okay. Then did that installer open on a different screen? It did. I think I'm going to pull the next one over so you can see it. Yep. Go ahead. That one's good. Yep, go ahead and hit open file. You might see that same pop-up again. Go ahead and hit next. Okay, you can just hit cancel here. That means you have it already. Okay. So that's good. And just go ahead and hit finish. Okay. And then this one? So that one you already have. That's just the RingCentral app. Okay. So let's go ahead and click the back arrow to go back to the downloads page. Then go ahead and scroll up in this list a little bit. You'll see that portal, EXE, the PC recruiter for Microsoft Outlook. Okay. Yep. Then we'll just run that when it's done. That'll do the same thing again. All right, and then go ahead and open up Outlook, the installed Outlook. at the bottom it looks like you have over here hold on let me pull this over actually I can't it says PC recruiter portal and then it says please enter All right, that number that you're going to enter is 124-726-281-961-622. Okay, let me see if I can pull this over so you can see now. This is what popped up. Alright, and then down at the bottom, you'll see like the Outlook icon. Right down here? Yep, go ahead and click on that other PC Recruiter one. Okay. Okay. All right. And we're going to hit, actually, first go into Edge for just a second. Then go to your PC Recruiter login page. You can just click the hyperlink that you have there. Go ahead and copy that URL up at the top. We're going to need that in just a second. Go ahead and minimize Chrome. Go ahead and hit add connection. Then you'll paste your URL at the top there where it says about Plink. Hit go. Do you want me to take that part out? Yeah, most of the time it goes away by itself. Go ahead and hit go. Go ahead and select your database that you log into from the drop-down. Then you'll put in your PCRecruiter username and password. Then hit Login. And this is going to ask if you want to sync the connection between your PC Recruiter and Outlook calendars. Just so if you like schedule appointment in PC Recruiter, it'll pop over to Outlook for you and vice versa. Okay, so yes, I'm assuming yes then. Most people do it. Yep. Okay. And then this is the, what connects your email for the activities. So you'll want to hit yes on that one. Then you'll check that little box that says, remember my password. And then where it says password down at the bottom, you'll enter it one more time there. Then before you hit save and close, hit the test connection up at the top. Perfect. Go ahead and hit okay. save and close. And then you'll click that always allow. And then open. So what this will give you is your PC Recruiter inside of Outlook. So you'll see up at the top where it says PC Recruiter Portal. There's the two arrows to the left of it. Did you do Unlooking? Down just a little bit. Yep, right in there. Over to the left. Right here? Nope, down a little bit. Oh, okay, right here. Yeah, you'll see those two arrows. That's how you can switch between PC Recruiter and your mailbox. Oh, okay. Oh, I see. So then, okay, if I click over. Yep, and then we're going to change one more setting here. Go to File up at the top left. Okay. Go to Options. Over on the left, bottom left. Oh, sorry. Where it says Optimize for Best Appearance, under User Interface Options, you're going to select Optimize for Compatibility. Up just a little bit. Nope. Okay. You'll see like the two check boxes. It's right above the check boxes. Yep. This one? Okay. Yep. Go ahead and hit okay. Then go ahead and exit out of Outlook real quick. Then we're just going to give it a second here. Then go ahead and open it back up. it'll just make that reading pane a little bit better looking for you there. Then you can hit skip there if you ever need to. Okay. But the most important part is if you choose to work on the web instead of Outlook, with this installed version, you'll just need to make sure you have it open during the day. So that way your emails sync into here, and that way they can sync with the portal. Okay. Perfect. and then yeah in that if you check that email I sent you that ring central setup that'll have our link to our Learning Center there so if you go ahead and open that page scroll down just a little bit into the article it'll show you like that the steps that the administrator needs to take to set your phone configuration. Okay. And then it'll also have what you need to do at the bottom there. Okay should I just after that's all done I'll just give you guys a call back and once Once they do their part, it shows you how to link it in here. So go ahead and scroll down just a little bit. Oh, I see. Okay, so there would be no need for that. Yep, the administrator sets up this part, and then go ahead and scroll down just a little bit more. That authenticating from the MyPCR screen, that's the only part you have to do. Okay. So once they have that set up, you'll see that. if you click the My PCR at the top of your PC Recruiter page, you'll see that RingCentral status connection issue. You'll just click on that, and it'll have you log into RingCentral, and then you'll be connected. Okay. Okay. Perfect. Yep. Once your admin sets up that other part for you, you should be good to go. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it. I'm more than happy to. Let us know if you run into any issues. Okay. Will do. Have a good day. Thank you. You too. Bye.",
