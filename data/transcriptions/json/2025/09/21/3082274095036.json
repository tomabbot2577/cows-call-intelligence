    "text": " Thanks for calling me, sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Good morning. This is Matt Barkus with Precision Executive Search. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing well. Doing well, thanks. Hey, I have a question in regards to the RingCentral app for my PC. Okay. I know I kept getting messages that it was going away, and then I downloaded it. you know, so download the new one, whatever. And then, like, literally I haven't turned off my computer in, like, a week or two. So I just did that and rebooted it. And now I don't have that. Like, I have the app on my phone where it can send and receive text. But I normally, like, if I'm in a record, a candidate record, I can click the text button in their record on my laptop and the box pops up on my screen and I can communicate and type right in that box. Yeah. So does that completely disappear? No. No, it's just probably you need to change one setting so when you're doing the call or the text, it knows the correct app to try to use. Okay. So if you – are you – you're an administrator? Yes. Okay. What database do you log into? You got Civil Engineering, Default, Precision Search, and TMG. Precision Search, yeah. Sorry, Precision Search. Okay. No problem. Okay, so if you go to, it's a real simple change. If you go to system on the main toolbar, go to users. Yep. And then click manage users. Okay. Okay, click on your username. Yep. Okay, so it looks like you might be using admin. so one thing I would do on your user account where it says contact phone there what you're going to want to do is put in your direct ring central number wait where is that it's not okay under contact information yeah one thing you'll want to do is put that there and the reason is like if you're ever doing like trying to get somebody to opt in to receiving text it'll pull the number from there 4942 okay yeah just make sure it's that direct primary number for you okay then save that and then next to that field what you're going to want to do is click on the gear icon for phone settings okay now that I cut the drop-down is kind of like cut off but what you're going to want to do where it says user phone configuration you want to make sure that says ring central app which actually it does okay wait hold on one second yeah so that should be there all in one yeah that should be there all in one okay so it does say that okay um did you change that after from going from the old app to the new i haven't changed i haven't been anything in the system like i what i was using was the rings that i think probably the was i don't know the ring central desktop phone maybe Yeah, the old one where it was just the singular phone. Okay. So it looks like you have since then changed that. So hold on. What else could be going on here? Because, like, when I click on, I have an icon that says Ring Central Phone on my laptop, and it, you know, it pulls it up, and then it says. Does it say Ring Central App? No, it says Ring Central Phone. No, I do have the main pencil. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You know what? Let's do a screen share. I just want to make sure. Because you want to make sure you have the one that's, like, installed. And that's the one that's going to try to use. Yeah. Let me do. Hold on. I'm going to try to text my daughter back. Okay. Okay. No worries. I need to talk to her, you know, and try to get a hold of your college kid. They don't want to answer. Oh. I know. I hear you. uh like i've been like trying to reach you for like a day and a half okay where's the good and cool ohio state ah okay oh buckeye yeah having a blast there yeah my uh my middle daughter she went there for she was there for her freshman year but that was during covid and it was just a nightmare i mean everywhere was a nightmare during yeah So she ended up transferring But I loved it up there I thought it was so cool I'm going actually Saturday Because my daughter Is at Ohio State And my son's at Ohio University Which is like an hour and a half further south So they're playing each other this weekend Oh really So we're like oh well we have to go to that game Even though my son's at Ohio State Yeah he would go there if he was smarter yeah right i actually wish they were kind of flipped because there's like i say it's like big city campus and oh yeah nice and cute and you know you feel a little safer with a girl there but yeah that's not her vibe no all right so let's do a screen share i'm gonna um okay I want to see what could be going on. Unless we just need to re-authenticate. Okay, so it's mbarkus at precision-recruiters.com. Does that sound right? Yes. Okay. All right. So I'm just going to do a Google Meet, new meetings. Okay, when you get this invite and you go to join, it's going to ask about camera and phone. You don't need to do either since we're already on the phone. And we don't need camera. We're going to share a screen instead. Okay. Okay. Join call. and are you on windows or mac i'm on windows okay i like i like that answer i'm not always i'm not always the best at troubleshooting a mac i have a windows computer i'm a lot slower moving around than that thing okay so what i'm going to have you do is at the bottom of your meeting screen there's a share screen option you're going to click that it's got the square with a rectangle but make sure you go over to at the right where it says entire screen mm-hmm and then click on which screen to show in case you have more than one monitor okay let's see okay so down at the bottom so that's the phone one and then that is yeah just to show you like what happens when I click on the phone yeah let's go over so that's the old one the audience yeah yeah just minimize that tab that's just something Google does just when you're in Chrome for see it gives this and if I hit exit then it like disappears so okay so the one I believe we want is see down at the very bottom at the very bottom last one at the right let's click on that one are you getting like a whole you see all these different screens like what am i yeah why don't you um minimize that tab it's just what chrome can do sometimes when this meeting tab one yeah don't close it just minimize it so even if you want to do it look at a new that way you don't have to look at it. I know, it's annoying, isn't it? Okay, so open this. Yeah, open that one. That's all you. Okay, let's there might be something in this app. No integration. Let's go to settings. Okay, let me open up my, maybe there's a setting in here that needs to be changed. Okay, general, okay. Okay, let's try under phone over at the left. Where is your phone option? Where it says more? Oops, right here. Yeah, let's try customize. Maybe this here. Why don't you have a phone option? Message contacts. I don't see nothing. And when I click on more, nothing else comes up. Okay, let me see. Okay, let's go more. Okay, let's go more. Customize. Message contacts. drag and drop here to place them under the more menu I know you have all the stuff here that I have maybe try reset to default that's weird no yeah I'm just trying to figure out message contacts what would be the difference because on my navigation menu at the very far left mine says phone video message text fax contacts webinar you just have message and contacts so that's kind of okay let's go to start with general I guess setting general okay so you don't have phone over there I'm going to say new company. Let's see here. It's just really odd that you don't have all the features. I'm just trying to figure out where. I'm going to use their health area. See if it's any good. It doesn't have anything to do with the fact that I have, like, the older version of PC Recruiter, does it? That shouldn't matter. Oh, no. This is RingCentral itself. Right. Yeah, I just didn't know because it's kind of, you know, because when you're in PC Recruiter, you can, you know, I can text from in there, you know, so. I'm going to have you do this. This is just a rough one. I think the number seen doesn't have all those options. Yeah, really with us, it's just put in the number, connect it, authenticate it, and make sure you have the right app selected. Right. That's where I'm kind of a little thrown off here. you don't have all the options that I'm seeing okay what I'm going to have you do is minimize ring central okay and then in the meeting chat I'm going to give you a link to their download page oops okay where is that it's going to be at the very bottom right of your meeting screen desktop app has officially launched this is what i've already done though i've already done this i'm sorry it's where okay message yeah and did you do the one at the very top get the new ring central app download for pc where where is that again i've done it like i've literally like it was always popping up on my screen so I always download it so it's got to be sitting it's I don't know why this wouldn't be it you know just under if we download it and have you sign in again like maybe if it gives you all of the options. So that page, that downloads page, did you use that link that's at the top though? you know where like is it should be visible here on my screen somewhere or so in your meeting window that Google meet screen you probably have to go back to that mirror okay sorry sorry I can send it to you I can send it to you by email if you want You hit it up in the other, it's the tab before, you don't need to join again. Okay, so where am I going? See the tab before at the top? Oh, this here, okay. Yeah, so go down at the very bottom right of the meeting screen. It's got kind of like a little blue dot above it. Oh, yeah. Okay, click on that. yeah click that link so this is where I always get to downloads try that one do download for PC yeah just in case there's multiple versions you never know so that's downloading at the top right and then once it's done you're going to open and run that. Based on those numbers, I'm pretty sure this is the one you have though. There is a setting called, like, use this app for phone. And the problem is I'm just not, like, why don't you get, why can't you see it to even get to it? Yeah. This is your workplace. Okay. I will change this. Oh, okay. Where did I go here? Okay. Try more. customize okay more customized customized tabs like that's wrong yeah very weird I have customized your navigation menu and you do not hmm I'm going to show my screen for a moment just so you can see what I'm trying to get you to and why I'm like so stumped um because I've never seen it not have all the stuff that I have so this is my ring central so see how i have phone video message text all these things and you don't right right and then when i go to customize tab i can't customize my navigation menu which you don't have and then here i could select which ones i want to show right because what I was thinking is that under where did I find it phone no it was settings and like you didn't have all this here right if I go to phone there is like how do you do like a ring out all that stellar stuff but I think it was this one is the one I was going to look for but I can't get to phone under your setting. Hmm. I mean, is it a Rain Central issue? Do I need to call them or? I would start there and then once you have this stuff, then I should be able to, I just don't know why all this isn't turned on for you. And that could be part of it. Yeah. because I've just never seen where you don't have this and I'm struggling to figure out where it's changing because even the things where I would think that would take you to there they're not there they're not there hmm okay do you have their number off nearby by chance um I don't but I think they have like a contact option here um is it in their health troubleshooting it's fine i'll just look it up online it's no big deal yeah i don't know if you had it right there oh all right yeah so all right let me call them explain to them what's going on and uh maybe do a screen share with them also yeah i yeah i don't even think you need to even bring not PC Recurder with it, I think we need to get their app going first. Yeah, okay. Because normally what will happen is once you have that is if you're – so you could uninstall the original app, and then what happens is when you're doing a call or things like that, it would just pass it over to that app. Right. In that setting. I'm just stumped why you don't have all those settings, and I can't figure out how to get to them. Yeah. All right. Well, let me give them a call and then I will give you guys a call back. Okay. And then when I sent you the invite, I think my contact information should be in there if you want to give me a call directly. I'm at extension 5466. 5466. Okay, cool. All right. Thanks, Robin. I'll give them a call and then I'll give you a buzz back. Okay. Thank you so much. Sorry about that. You got it. No worries. Bye. See you. Bye-bye. Thank you.",
