    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. How are you doing? Good afternoon. I am very well, Oscar. How are you? I'm doing great. And you? I'm doing pretty well. Pretty well. Thanks for joining me. Thank you for having me. For sure, for sure. So yeah, so wanted to kind of chat with you a little bit about the dimensional search process, the setup, how that goes, and next steps to get you up and running on PC Recruiter as part of your dimensional search setup and everything. So basically what will happen, the first thing we need to do is get you your information. I need to get your information to send over the paperwork to get you signed up on PC Recruiter. As you know, $7.50 setup, $50 a user a month. You're one user, are you? Yep, one user. I'm tracking $7.50 initial setup, and I think I'm not really clear as far as the monthly. Yeah, it's $50 per user per month. So since you're one user, it would be $50. If you ever need to add additional users, you can do it, and it just makes it an additional $50 a month per user for that. Okay. So that is there. And then what would happen, I'll email that over to you. It's going to come through in a PandaDoc, just like a doc you sign, just a different name brand. Once you sign that, my accounting team is going to send over the invoice for the setup in the first month. As soon as that's paid, within a day or so, they'll create a database link for you. And it's going to be a link that will have your admin username, a password to get in. That's going to be what you'd utilize for PC Recruiter. Okay. Once we have that, we'll also assign you a PC Recruiter trainer on our end here. So you'll have one coach here at PC Recruiter for 10 hours. So you have 10 hours of training with us in addition to your coach and training with dimensional search. So you essentially have two entities getting you trained up on the system. Your trainer here at PC Recruiter is going to get you two to three hours before your dimensional search training. Then they'll kind of take over and do some training. And then they'll turn it back over and they'll kind of hand you off back and forth. You'll do some training with PC Recruiter, training with Dimensional Search, back and forth that way. Are you in the July or the August class for Dimensional Search? August class. August class. I think, is it the 8th? I think someone told me. The 4th. The 4th. The 4th. Okay. That is good. Okay. So, yeah, so all we need to do to get everything started is get your company name and street address, even though I'm going to email you the paperwork. I just need to know company name and street address to produce the paperwork. Sure, yeah. So my company name is Transform is that what? Transform is Transform AML. Is it possible you could pop it in the chat? Oh, yeah, in the chat. Just a little bit. Rather than try to start because I'm having trouble getting it. All right. Okay, TrustForm AI. Awesome. Okay, and what is the street address associated with that? And I have your email. Perfect, perfect. Excellent, excellent. So I will jot that down here. Okay, yes, so what I'll do, I will put together the paperwork, email that over to you, review that, let me know if you have any questions. Once you sign it, it comes back to me, I'll countersign it, and then I will have the invoice sent over for the setup in the first month. As soon as that's paid, we can get everything started and underway. I think I can't hear you talking. Are you muted? All right. So I spoke yesterday with the tech team from Brian and Tiny Robinson. Both recommended to what next week is almost July already. So they were recommending that I won't start my tech training until next week to purchase the PCR by July 7th, which is Monday. Would that work for you or do I have to? The thing is that the way we strategize it is that I don't want to go ahead and make a lot of purchases and then not use it or get trained on it until two weeks later. Sure. Because we know that it's a six-month window. Every week counts. So I want to make sure that when I pay for it, I'm using it almost immediately. And because I won't be using it or be trained on it. I don't even have my report on my niche market yet until maybe maybe this week. I would like to go off on buying the KCR and follow the recommendation of the week of July 7th. You know, July 4th is next week. It's a little holiday. So just for expectation management and the invoice, I won't be getting a lot of it until like July 7th. Okay. Why don't I? I'll send the paperwork today but I'll date it to start July 7th if that's reasonable that way it'll be dated to start not until July 7th then sign it that week the invoice will be paid that week and then we'll get you up and running that week we can wait until after the holiday that's no problem at all perfect yeah yeah yeah if you can date everything and bill everything by the week I can fill everything out and then you know have it dated for after the holiday and that would be great yeah we can do it and if you can sign it now or sign it on the 7th whatever but I'll date it to start on July 7th. So we'll do it that way. Okay. Sounds great. All right. Well, I will go ahead and send that out. Anything further you need, let me know. Reach out to me. I'm here to help. And then once your trainer's assigned, we'll hop back on another call like this. I'll introduce them. They're going to have a few questions, and then they'll be the ones to kind of get you up, trained on the system. They'll do a couple, two to three hours before you go to dimensional search as well. Awesome. I'm looking forward to it. Very well. I've been hearing great things about the PCR. I've seen the videos. One of the dimensional search coaches, Tony Miller, kind of walked me through real quick how it links up to, you know, LinkedIn and HireEasy and ZoomInfo. And what is it? Recentral. And I'm just looking forward to actually start, you know, training. So this is definitely encouraging. And I do look forward to doing this with you guys and getting trained. Absolutely. Yeah, I look forward to working with you and getting you up and running. And I'll send that over dated the 7th. We'll connect. Maybe I'll check back if I haven't seen or heard anything from you by that 7th, just to touch base. Okay. All right. Good one. All right. Thank you very much. You take care. You too, Jim. Take care. All right. Bye-bye.",
