    "text": " Hello, this is Ginny. Hi, Ginny. It's Robin Montoni. How are you? I'm good, Robin. How are you? Good. Yeah, it looks like that card that you had did decline. Yeah, it's a whole debacle with Chase. Let me give you an Amex. Hold on. Don't ever deal with Chase Bank. Oh, really? Oh, my God. All right. Okay. All right. So try. Okay. So what's the name on the card? Try this one. I've moved twice, so my life is crazy right now. It's American Express, Virginia K. Garner is on the front. Garner Executive Search. Virginia K. Garner. Okay. And card number? 3727-200-814-95007. And the expiration month and year? Let me see. 7-2030. 7-30. The security code? 2720. And then the address for the card? 1072. Saddle Club Drive. I'm sorry, Saddle. Okay. Yeah, Saddle and Sam, A, Dog, Dog, L-E, Club. You said Drive. Drive, yep. A Saddle, Club, one word or two? One word. One, okay. All right. It's McMurray, so M-C-M-U-R-R-A-Y. Okay. P-A. 15317. 15317. Okay. Add card. All right, we're going to try that. I have another one. Okay. And this was 6831 was the original. This one's there. Okay. Pardon me? 6831 was the original. 5007 is the new one, right? One five. Yeah. One five. 5037, the zip code, or the, it's 20, what do you, the card that you just gave me, it ends in 5007? Oh, yes, yes, I'm sorry, I thought you were asking security, so yes, that's correct. All right, let me see, let's see, let's see if it goes, okay, let's see, Take some moments for me to... I'm not telling if it went through yet or not. I'm also going to send you an invitation to this billing portal right now. And it goes to G. Garner at the Garner Group. Okay. What you can do is in that billing portal, I don't know if you ever, like, you know, when we were in our old system, you always had to like call us up if your card ever changed or things like that okay so okay i'm not on my computer right now i'm yeah with a new billing portal like what you can do is you click sign up you create an account it's just for billing okay use a pcr password but then like i can't go in and delete your original card but you could go under the vault and um from there you could like always change your card um you know delete a card if it's you know you know you're never going to use it anymore. Okay. Did this one go through for you? I'm still waiting for confirmation one way or the other. I'm thinking that it did not. All right. Why don't you go in there and add the other one then. Okay. Yeah, this declined too. Unless I entered something wrong. No, whatever. It's a whole thing. Let me go in there and just add. Yeah. know why but okay let me go in i'll i'll do that i'll fix that and if it doesn't now in the vault area i believe if you have auto pay turned on for a car you have to turn the auto pay off for the card before you can delete it from what i thought okay okay you probably just want to turn that off for that card and then try deleting it and then you could okay okay all right all right let me know if you run into any issues yeah no i mean i'll do that right now i just had to move locations um Okay, let me try to do that right now and figure that out and call American Express. Okay, do you want me to stand the phone with you? In case I answered it wrong, I could have maybe missed a number. Never know. Let me see. Hold on. I've got to get back in. Unless sometimes, too. Just a second. I've just got to get in. I'm here. Put this Microsoft security thing on so sometimes I don't get my email. Ridiculous. Quarantine everything. I didn't get the portal. Can you give me the address to type it in? Yeah. You didn't get that email? No, not yet. You know, this is a security thing on my email. problematic emails. And so it now it does, it takes everything. It doesn't allow me to, it's just ridiculous. Okay. I'm going to go this way. Customer portal. Okay. Give me the address. Here, I'm going to email it to you. I know, but I'm not getting my emails is my point. Oh, at all? not it take I don't know where it is if you said you sent it already it didn't come to me yet so I just sent it from support at main sequence all right let me see if it'll come hold on I did do another one but let's try this one I know that's the first I didn't get the first one that's my point I'm not getting what the g garner at the garner grp g yep g garner at the GRP at the Garner GRP. Yes. Yeah, I didn't get it. It takes a while because of some quarantine thing. So if you can give me the – wait, here we go. Send invoice. Receipt. Billing portal. Okay. Okay. So when you click on it, when you go into that email, there's a create an account option. Okay, yep, set username and password. Okay, so I have to use the ggarner at the garnergrp.com, since that's the email you have for your billing. Okay. And then whatever password you want to create for it. All right, write this down while we're doing this. Thank you. error right what's the error an email should be coming to confirm How's your day, Robin? Not too bad. Not too bad at all. Thursday. Friday Eve. Oh, okay. Let's see if I have a better way to look at it. I like that. I'm going to use that. It's Friday Eve. I like that. Yeah. Okay. Please confirm your email. Yeah, that's just basically wanting to make sure it's you. Okay. Maybe later. Okay. Let's see. Name and ending. So I should go to this vault here is what you're saying? Yeah, if you go over to the vault, you're probably going to have two cards in there now. One I try to create and then the one you already had in there. Right. so I believe the one that you had originally you should be able to go ahead and delete that one okay once you go to vault oh that's definitely an old one okay that's when you should be able to delete because it's not on autopay all right how do you delete it though when you click on vault does it show like a list of cards or a stored payment method I'm going to see if I get a screenshot. Yeah, it does. Okay, delete. Okay. Okay. And then for the other card that remains, I think it's above the card. Yes, I see it. At the right. You've got to turn off the auto-pay first. Okay. All right, let's try. And then you should be able to delete it. I don't think it lets you edit the card. I think you have to create a new card. All right. It was me that did something wrong. Okay. All right. I'm able to delete payment method. Oh, come on. Yeah, you have to turn that auto pay off. I did say no. I said no. Let me just see if I can add a new card. Oh, dear. No, and it won't. Okay. Let me add a new payment. Yeah, is there a save option once you turn the option off? It says it's Autopay invoices. It says no. Okay. And when you flip it to no, do you have to hit save? I don't remember that one. Oh, yeah. Maybe you did. You're right. Okay. Okay. All right. Let's do this. Let's put this one in. Come on. No, I don't want to store a card. So you store the card and you can go back and auto pay with this card. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. That'd be helpful. I had it set up like that for a long time, but yeah, as I mentioned, everything got screwed up when you move twice. No one likes your address. No one likes your address when you do that. Yeah, I guess there's security. You've got to make sure that you're putting your new card information in, I guess. Yeah, I'm putting this new one in here now. You might, yeah, well, maybe it didn't populate this. Let's see. All right. So, and I need to go in to select these auto-pay for these other, these invoices are open. Right. And I didn't do the upgrade one. If you want, I can show you that one right this moment. Yeah, let's see. Can we see if these go through? Yeah, go ahead. And I think if you go to invoices at the left, you should see the two that are open. And then you can go in there and pay those. They were approved. Okay. So these were all approved. These two were just approved. Okay, let me see what I see here. Yeah, the balance is zero now for that. Okay, so then what I'm going to do is I had to make one invoice for the upgrade in training. Okay. and how does that happen so someone will call me about that or how does that yeah once we do this i let them know that you paid like that the invoice is paid then he creates a ticket where they go through and do the upgrades and then they'll sign you a trainer okay fantastic okay so let me create this other invoice do you want me to do it where this one just goes auto pay as well yeah yeah okay and then what's the same same would it be like the 67 same price a month or something around that after the initial upgrade? PCRM plus AI and . Premium plus AI and PCRM. OK. This is just a one-time invoice for 500 for the setup. And wait, you gave... a different address before right 1072 yeah i gotta change your address hold on one second yeah you do that's maybe why it didn't work out well because yeah my i've moved so okay let me change this edit okay i'll do this part too jenny garner i think sometimes too like the name that you put in has to match the card or something okay so what is the new address um and it's Virginia Garner is on the card, too, by the way, so I don't know if that matters. But the address is 1072. 1072. Battle Club Drive. That's S-A-D-D-L-E. Gotcha. All right, good there. And it's McMurray. Okay. Yeah, McMurray. A-Y. A-Y, okay. And that was 15317. 15317? Yep. And it was state Pennsylvania? Yep, Pennsylvania. Okay. All right, because that makes a difference because then you are out of state. So you are now out of state. Out of state. Okay, I'll change that here. It's all sector invoice price to out of state, state. OK. So let me fix all this part then. New invoice. Okay, picked up all the new location information. Good. And then it's out of state. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and add a new location. And then it's out of state. Okay. So that one should go automatically. And then I will also adjust your recurring. Take off the PAPI. This needs to change to out of state. Out of state. OK. your number two users or one user for 60 so your next invoice like your next monthly one which is scheduled for August 3rd that'll be at the new rate for one user okay which is what he wrote it as one is 60 that you were in you at 30 you were at two years two users at $30 per month now okay one user at 60 okay okay so I need to change your user count as well okay so I'm going to change this over here oh as well fix this here room here Okay, this is... Oh, we already changed that part. Alright, we're all set. I believe... Let me make sure that this one went through. Okay. And that one went through too, it looks like. All right. So I will let Jim know and we should be all set. Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much, Robin. You are welcome. Have a good week. Okay. You too. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye. Thank you.",
