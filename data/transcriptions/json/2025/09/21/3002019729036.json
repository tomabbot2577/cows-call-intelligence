    "text": " This is Gina. How can I help you? Hi, Gina. It's me, Mackenzie, again, at PC Recruiter. Yeah, hi. I'm calling back because I'm making your ticket, and I realized we didn't try one thing, and I was hoping you had another five minutes or so to just try something for me real quick. Sure. Okay, great. So we don't need to hop on a screen share. I'm just going to walk you through it. So could you please for me go to any capturable screen? So a LinkedIn profile or a Zoom info profile. You don't have to actually capture them. Just bring up a profile and then bring up the capture tool. Okay. I have somebody on my screen right now. Okay. And then click to capture them so that the capture tool actually appears in the right side of your screen. My goal is to see if this works. We're going to add, if it's okay with you, I would like to try adding fields to the layout of the capture tool because the capture tool will always show you all the information that it's capturing. So in order for these fields to capture, you might actually need to add fields to the layout to capture them, right? So we're going to add the fields work phone and work email, if you don't mind. and then I'll ask if you try to capture a Zoom info if those populate. Because as I was writing the ticket, I realized we didn't even try this, and that would be the first thing that the developers ask. Did you even try to add the field? And then it was like, oh, yeah, duh. So, yeah, let's try and add them. So do you have the capture tool on your screen? Yeah, hold on. Let me switch you over to my headset. Hold on one second, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry if I'm too loud or something. I don't know. Or not loud enough? No, no. Hold on. OK, can you hear me? Yeah. OK, perfect. So let me just capture this person, find this person first, because I was literally going to add him to at .. Hopefully this person is there. Of course not. Okay. Okay, hold on. So we're not really capturing, we're just adding someone, right? Yeah, you don't need to capture anyone yet. First, I want to add fields to the layout of capture tool, which doesn't require that you capture anybody. OK, fantastic. So I'm there. Yeah. So we need the capture tool like appearing on the right side of the screen where it's showing the actual fields. Sure. Yeah. It'll say, you know, overview contact information. Yes. OK, so at the very, very top on the top right, there's a button that's like a square with a pencil. and if you hover it, it says edit field configuration. Okay, clicking. Yeah, okay. So then that will put the capture tool into like the edit mode. And so under contact information, could you add two fields to that widget and select work phone and email underscore work? Okay, one second here. uh, plus sign. So add a plus sign. Okay. So contact info. Yeah. Another one will appear down below, change the dropdown to the field you want. And you're hoping to capture to like the work email and the work phone field. So try to add those two fields there. It'll be, I guess, phone underscore work and phone underscore email or email underscore work. Sorry. I was talking too fast. Okay. So under contact information, you want me to hit the plus sign and you want me to add what again? Yeah, the plus sign will add another field to the layout there. And then you can change which fields appear. So the third one down, because I think you only had two fields. So you could have added a third. So the very bottom one, you can change it and try to change that to email underscore work is the work email field. OK, so hold on one second. I need to get rid of this. I have all this little tools on the side and it keeps popping up. Come on. Hold on. Hold on. Bear with me. I know what I'm doing. Bear with me. It's okay. I'm not rushing you. Okay. It's gone. All right. So, okay. So, there was only two now. When I clicked the plus sign, it added another field. and now I'm clicking on the drop down and then I will be selecting what again? Scroll down to email underscore work. Okay, got it. And that's the work email field. And then add another field and try and find your alternative phone field. For you, it might be called work phone. Okay, yeah. And then save that. Once both of those fields are added, in the top corner of the capture tool again, there will be like a floppy disk icon for saving this change that you've made. Okay, what? Phone. And after you do that, I would kind of want you to close the capture tool and refresh the page so that it opens fresh and make sure those fields appear again. Like, make sure it's saved, you know. Okay, so. Okay, I'm refreshing now. Then I'm going to go back, click to add. I want to make sure that it's there. Okay, so contact. Oh, yeah. Okay, so contact information now has email address, cell phone, email work, email underscore work, and then work phone. okay cool so now if you could capture a zoom info profile and just tell me do those fields that you just added do those populate with anything because if they don't then then i could definitely make the ticket like even when we add these fields here it doesn't populate right because then then it's like then it makes more sense as like a bug right um because before because it's not i don't think it adds like hidden info like if it's not showing it to you it's not going to add it so at the very least at the very least you could if it's not capturing them you could at least copy them and paste them in there and then um like when you capture it like it'll be there you don't have to like do anything after the initial capture like at least you could just copy paste it immediately into the field you want and then save it like yeah like at least going forward if if you like this adding these two fields you can keep them there and then you know on your initial capture of someone you could just fill those in. So at least there's a workaround there. If it doesn't work automatically. How do I do that? How do I do a test? Is there a, is there a person in zoom info that you were planning on capturing? Or you don't actually need to hit submit on the capture. I think we're just seeing if the, because if you just open the capture tool, it'll like pull the information to the fields, right? So you don't actually have to save them to the database, but could you just find somebody with like multiple emails and multiple phone numbers and hit click to capture, but then like don't save it? Okay. Just to see if those fields populate with. You mean to say do it in Zoom Info? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Zoom Info. I want to see if there's multiple phone numbers in Zoom Info, if it will pull to those multiple phone fields that now we have them in the capture tool. Okay. That we've configured them, right? Because if that works, then that solves your problem. If not, at least I can be like, we added multiple phone fields and it only pulled one of them, right? It only pulled one phone number, even though. And it might still just be that they're like, well, sorry, that's just kind of like a limitation. But at least we tried. All right. So I'm on Zoom info. I have somebody that I want to capture. Okay. And then you want me to pretend to capture it? Yeah, you don't have to like hit submit for this test. Could you click to capture and then see those? Yeah. The profile on ZoomInfo has multiple emails and multiple phone numbers, right? Yes. Okay, great. Okay. Yeah, so click to capture. And when the capture tool opens, does the fields that you just added to the contact information widget, did those populate with anything? Okay, I'm checking right now. Okay, so email address. on Zoom Info PCR capture, it should have, okay, it's still, no, it's still not correct. So the email address in Zoom Info that says email address is capturing the company email address. that should go to the email underscore work. Okay. Yeah. And only one email was captured? Like there's multiple emails, but only one was captured? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And the business email went to email, right? The business email went to the email address. Primary address field. Okay. Yeah. So that looks a lot more like a bug for the ticket's sake. Okay. And then the other email underscore work is just blank, right? It's blank right now. But yeah, correct. It's blank right now. Okay. All right. And then the same thing with the phone numbers? Did only one phone number get brought in? Only the phone number works. There is cell phone number is the actual cell phone number, and the work phone number is actually the business number. So, yeah, the phone number works. The email didn't work yet. Okay. Okay, that's good news. Okay, so then it looks like adding the work phone field is like a useful change for you. That's good. All right, well, that's helpful. At least I think that like helps you a little bit, right? Like you can, if you keep these fields there, at least like if you see two emails, you can fix it immediately, right? Like you can say, oh, this email is supposed to go to email work and you could like move it down. And then you can copy the personal email to the email address field. And then when you save them, that will go into the PCR database. Correct. Like the first time, right? You can, at least you can like solve it right here on the capture tool. Cause yeah, I realized when I got off the call, I was like, wait, we didn't even try to add the fields and see. Cause yeah, it's not going to add a field that it doesn't show you first. So we would have had to try this before I could even enter a ticket. So at least we did try it and it does appear that like you're the same kind of gripe you had with it still exists because once we added email work, it didn't really distinguish between the two. So I can still enter this ticket and now I have a better like a better description of the ticket. So that's great. So, OK. All right. Great. All right. Gina, thanks for going through that with me. Oh, no worries. That helps our case. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to go back to finishing entering the ticket now that I know that that is how it works. Because I would have tried it myself, but I don't have a Zoom info account, so I had to. Okay. So thank you for trying that. All right. Well, again, have a good rest of your week and holiday. Thank you. I'll let you go, and I'll be entering the ticket shortly. And, yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Bye. You're welcome. Bye, Gina. Take care.",
