    "text": " Good afternoon, Main Sequence. Hi, Jim. This is Rob Barquette. Sorry I missed you. No, no problem, Rob. How are you? I'm doing excellent. I apologize. I'm on the road. But, yeah, I didn't want to miss your call again. Yeah, I wanted just to kind of check in and see how I could help. Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, long story short, I was with the company for six years. We used the PC recruiter Yeah, we used the PCR Rather religiously The company dissolved The two owners split I may choose to go my own route Or I may choose to go under one of the owners Who are continuing to use But I just wanted to get kind of a rough ballpark idea Of what it would be running me If I'm just doing my own sole proprietorship and kind of doing my own thing outside the company. Yeah, well, what I would do, I would be able to keep you the same price point that NIT had as I did with the two of them. So I worked with both partners as they split and kept everybody at the same price point. So it's $105 per month per user. Perfect. Okay. And I think it was like $500 to set it up, and that included training and everything like that. Maybe a little less. I'm going to have to remember what they were. But, yeah, $105 a month. Perfect. Yeah, that was pretty much it, my friend. And, yeah, so I'll probably be circling back with a decision on Monday or Tuesday of next week. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah, and if you do want to get rolling, I can email paperwork. I can act as your account manager, get you set up and running, and then get you coordinated with training and anything like that. Absolutely. No, perfect. I appreciate it, Jim. Thank you very much. Not a problem. All righty. Take care. All right. Talk soon.",
