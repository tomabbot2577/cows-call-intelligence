    "text": "Hi, thanks for calling me back. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? This is Robin. Yes, I'm there, Robin. How are you doing? I'm pretty good. Yeah, I'm really confused. I mean, I've been a long-time customer, and they changed my credit card. I put a new credit card in, and then I got this note. I don't know, did my credit card, because one of my credit cards was compromised. Okay. So I'm not sure, you know, because I always had the automatic, you know, billing. So here's what happened. We changed billing systems, and you had to put in your card information on the new system, at least for the first invoice. Yeah, I did that. Yeah, I did that. Yeah, when did you do that? Because I'm wondering if it was like after, like maybe you didn't pay the invoice, but you put the card in. So your next one will probably auto pay? Yeah, I paid the invoice. I did. Okay. Yeah, I did that. But, I mean, that's... Because I do see one open that was 615, but then it says updated 624. So maybe you put the card information in, but it didn't process that invoice. But it is set up for auto pay. Yeah, it's set up for auto pay. Okay, can I give you the credit card again? you could put me in for auto pay? It might just be I need to reprocess this because it was showing that it is set up for auto pay. Okay. My wife just gave me the bill. On 6-15, my credit card was checked. It was $72.99. $72.91 was charged from PC Recruiter. That's where I'm confused. Okay. Let me look in my other system too. Yeah. okay I have a payment on 515 no this says here here my I'm holding my wife with all kids thank you yeah you're right 515 we thought it said 615 yeah I have a 515 so right now is this the June one now you do have auto pay enabled let Let me see what your payment method is. I can only see the last four. Yeah. 4818? No, that's the bad one. That's a bad card. That's the one I got. Oh, okay. I got compromised. Let me give you a new card. Okay. So let me do this here. Hold on one second. Edit. Add new card. Okay. What's the name on the card? Carl V. Richards I'm sorry, what's the middle initial? V for Vincent V, okay, I thought I heard it so I'll make sure and what is the card number? 524-03-890-1383-1504 5-2-4-0-38-90-13-83-15-04 Yes 5-2-4-0-38-90-13-83-1504 Okay And what is the expiration on that card? February 28th And the CVC number? 5-2-0-28-03-15-04 Address 40, Penn Circle. Yeah, it's all the same. Okay, okay. Oh, gosh, now it shows me both. What was the last four on those? Wait a minute. I got it recorded. The last four numbers. 1504. 1504. Okay. All right. So what I can do, your auto pay is now on with card ending in 1504. Do you want me to go ahead and process that one for June for you? Yeah. Okay. And send me the receipt, please. Okay. I don't know. Auto paste skipped. Why? Oh, that's the old one. Okay. Hold on one second. Thank you. I said that China's paid yet let me look at a different way Coming up is decline. It's a valid card. I used it yesterday. Tell me any more transaction details. I did it with 1504. And then it's 2-28, the quark sparks, February 28, and then 5-2-0 is the number. yeah okay I just got an email from PC recruiters saying thank you for your business as the car was declined. I don't know why it's... Yeah. Let me read the numbers to you again, please. It's 5 2 4 0. I can't go... So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to do it this way. I'm going to have... Because I can only see certain information. I can kind of put it in, but once it's in there, I can't really see it for security. Right. So I can only see like the last four numbers. Right. Okay. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to send you a link to our customer portal to carl.richards at syf.com. Yes. Okay. Have you done this yet where you go and you sign up for the customer portal? No, I haven't. Okay. So you should be getting an email here in just a moment. Okay. Okay, it just came through. Okay. Okay. So when you get there, there's like a customer billing portal link. You're going to click sign up in that email. Okay, so it says, okay, I've got to put a create. create, I'm assuming create a password. You have to hit sign up first. Because it says create account. Yeah, create an account. Okay, so you have to have it sorted on that one. Okay. It opens up to create account. You're almost set, Dad. That's why you have to email them. I'm assuming I've got to create a password. Yeah, you have to create a password for it. So this is just for billing, so it's not using any kind of PPR credentials or anything like that. okay okay and sign up okay and this is okay i already have he says Okay. See, I'm a little bit vision impaired, so you've got to bear with me. That's okay. Okay. It says, by proceeding you agree to user agreement. So sign up. I click on sign up. Okay. Please confirm your email. Okay. Okay. What that means is it's going to send you an email. Okay. I haven't gotten the other email yet. Please confirm your email. Email was sent to verify your account. Yeah. Sometimes that takes a moment. There it goes. Just came in. This says confirmed email. Confirmed email. It opens up a portal. Once you go into that portal, there's a vault area yeah it says it's okay so it says and so it's a different credit card i was one so so what do i do so in the vault area you probably should see two cards um i only have i only have one credit card my wife can't do some money i only have one so i could put because once this end in 4818 is no longer valid and then five oh now here i just click one and it says end in 1504 that's the one i just added so what i would recommend doing take out the one that says 1504 like once you have i think you got to have one in so let's delete the one 1504 because then i'm going to have you redo that one or or does it let you edit or does it let you edit no no it doesn't let you edit just says new card okay does it let you delete that 1504 that way we're not recreating the same one does it let you delete it first and then no it doesn't let you delete doesn't let you delete can we do a screen share so i could see would that be okay yeah sure okay because the more i see this the better for me when i'm helping people thank you thank you yeah because it's a little new to me too so um all right and what email have i used it's different than that i have carl c-a-r-l dot richards r-i-c-h-a-r-d-s and the at sign in three letters s is in sam y is in yellow episode frank.com got it okay I'm sorry about this oh no it's alright it's okay I just emailed you a meeting link it's just going to be a Google meet sure sure yeah and then when you go into the meeting that link I sent you you won't need mic or camera because I'm going to share your screen okay so join call click that Okay.

good.\n\n4\n00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:04,337\nHow are you?\n\n5\n00:00:04,707 --> 00:00:05,055\nThis is Robin.\n\n6\n00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:06,879\nYes, I'm there, Robin.\n\n7\n00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,640\nHow are you doing?\n\n8\n00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,272\nI'm pretty good.\n\n9\n00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,677\nYeah, I'm really confused.\n\n10\n00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,219\nI mean, I've been a long-time customer, and they changed my credit card.\n\n11\n00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:17,452\nI put a new credit card in, and then I got this note.\n\n12\n00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:21,860\nI don't know, did my credit card, because one of my credit cards was compromised.\n\n13\n00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:22,991\nOkay.\n\n14\n00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,830\nSo I'm not sure, you know, because I always had the automatic, you know, billing.\n\n15\n00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,737\nSo here's what happened.\n\n16\n00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,062\nWe changed billing systems,\n\n17\n00:00:34,143 --> 00:00:36,548\nand you had to put in your card information on the new system,\n\n18\n00:00:36,588 --> 00:00:37,671\nat least for the first invoice.\n\n19\n00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:43,633\nYeah, I did that.\n\n20\n00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,014\nYeah, I did that.\n\n21\n00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:46,069\nYeah, when did you do that?\n\n22\n00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,908\nBecause I'm wondering if it was like after,\n\n23\n00:00:48,928 --> 00:00:50,736\nlike maybe you didn't pay the invoice,\n\n24\n00:00:50,756 --> 00:00:51,559\nbut you put the card in.\n\n25\n00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:54,278\nSo your next one will probably auto pay?\n\n26\n00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:56,860\nYeah, I paid the invoice.\n\n27\n00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:57,316\nI did.\n\n28\n00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,087\nOkay.\n\n29\n00:00:58,723 --> 00:00:59,619\nYeah, I did that.\n\n30\n00:01:00,122 --> 00:01:00,914\nBut, I mean, that's...\n\n31\n00:01:02,122 --> 00:01:05,631\nBecause I do see one open that was 615, but then it says updated 624.\n\n32\n00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,018\nSo maybe you put the card information in, but it didn't process that invoice.\n\n33\n00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,793\nBut it is set up for auto pay.\n\n34\n00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,015\nYeah, it's set up for auto pay.\n\n35\n00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,580\nOkay, can I give you the credit card again?\n\n36\n00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:22,018\nyou could put me in for auto pay?\n\n37\n00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,376\nIt might just be I need to reprocess this because it was showing that it is set up\n\n38\n00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:27,758\nfor auto pay.\n\n39\n00:01:28,682 --> 00:01:28,784\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,299\nMy wife just gave me the bill.\n\n41\n00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,639\nOn 6-15, my credit card was checked.\n\n42\n00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:36,564\nIt was $72.99.\n\n43\n00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,966\n$72.91 was charged from PC Recruiter.\n\n44\n00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,394\nThat's where I'm confused.\n\n45\n00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,387\nOkay.\n\n46\n00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:48,152\nLet me look in my other system too.\n\n47\n00:01:49,868 -->
