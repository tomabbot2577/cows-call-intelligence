    "text": " Hello? Hey, Robert. It's Rob in Montoni. How are you? Sorry, I was in a longer call than I expected. So, yeah, your issue, simple to fix. Ready? We've just got to clear cache images and files in your browser. Let me know when you're ready, and I'll take you through this stuff. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Are you in Chrome? Yes. Okay. Go to the three vertical dots at the top right of Chrome, and it's going to pop up a menu. Yes. Click Delete Browsing Data, and then don't do anything else until I walk you through. Let me know when you're at that screen. Okay. I'm at that right now. Okay. For time range, set it to all time. All time, yes. Okay. uncheck browsing history and cookies and other site data only leave cached images and files selected that's the only ones checked okay click delete data clear now okay and then fully exit Chrome we shut it down completely yeah just Chrome just your browser you can keep any other apps up. Okay. And then if you go back to PCR, it should work. Ooh, that's quick. Yeah, sometimes, like, you know, if things like update and stuff, your browser tries to cache it so that it loads quicker. But when things change, it can cause a problem. So occasionally clearing cache should fix it. no I still can't delete okay now you said clear data sorry did you say clear data or delete data I thought you were saying clear I'm not 100% sure let's also try this I wonder if your browser is maybe outdated, that could be another thing. If you go to the three vertical dots again and then go to help. Help and feedback? Help. Yeah, help and then go to about Google Chrome. What that'll do is it'll check for updates to Chrome. Actually, sorry, I'm using Edge. Microsoft Edge. Oh, you're using edge okay so then we got to go over to edge and kind of do those same kind of steps okay so open up edge oh i'm in edge right okay go to the three horizontal dots oh i'm sorry it's yeah it's three one two three sorry yes okay okay and then here we're going to do delete browsing data okay and really same thing It says clear now. So hold on. So make sure you say time range, all time. All time, yes. Uncheck everything, leaving only cached images and files selected, and hit clear now. So the only one that will have the check mark is cached images and then clear now, correct? The only one you want to select is the cached images and files. Everything else you uncheck. But I just did this. Okay, so were you in Chrome or Edge when you did that? I haven't changed, Edge. Okay, all right. All right, let's do a screenshot. I'm going to send you an invite here real quick because that should fix it. What am I going to? Meet and get your email address. Robert.Sandler at SandlerSearch.com, right? Correct. See, I've got on my screen here, I check clear now, and then what comes up is prophecy search and services clear browsing data. Choose what to clear. What's going on with that? Okay. I'm going to send you a meeting invite. Let's do a screen share. Okay. Let's just exit. Thank you. Did you get the email from me? Not yet. All right. Yep, there it is. Okay. Join call. Yes? Yes. Okay. or join meeting microphone and camera I actually don't need camera but that's okay actually you know what you don't need microphone and camera because we're on the phone together okay are you there I'm here I'm in the meeting it's not showing me as you coming in did you click the link to join the screen share I thought I did. Join call. Let's try this again. You're not in? I'm here. I see myself. Hello. Where can I find you? should be a meeting link does it say join call or is there one that says there should be a link in there well what I see is join call that's what I tapped I'm going to send this to you then I'm sorry I'm going to send this to you then all I see is join call Robin okay I don't yeah I don't know how they word it I join call and I see myself. End meeting. And then it says, I see myself. Sign in with your Google account. What's your name? Ask to join. Oh, you got to do the ask to join option probably. Got to put in your name and join. That's probably a step missing. There it goes. Okay. All right. Okay. So what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of your meeting screen, if you can click share screen it's the square with the arrow pointing up oh this one share screen okay and over at the left of that share screen there is a microphone option you can hit mute since we're already on the phone because it's trying to use your computer or your stuff sometimes well what I've got choose what you share Okay, so go over to where it says entire screen. I'm looking for entire screen. It's going to be over at the right in that pop-up window. I don't see entire screen, sorry. What am I looking for? So when you click on share screen, it pops up a window. Did you get that? It says choose what to share. Okay. And then over at the right, you should see an option that says entire screen. Oh, there it is. There's going to be like three tabs. Okay. Then that, depending on how many monitors you have, you might see like one preview or like three previews, depending on how many monitors. Click on what to show under entire screen. it says share okay hit share go ahead and hit share you only have one screen yes okay and nothing happens when i hit share did it give you like a little preview of your screen there we go there it goes okay yeah we're in okay so when i have you do is okay so you're in edge okay so let's go what is all that on the screen yeah that's what that's just what happens that's okay don't worry about that um what i'm gonna have you do is let's close out a pc anything pc recruiter that you have open in your edge oh sorry what do you want me to do so you need to close all of your pc recruiter windows okay Okay Okay Okay let's go to a new browser tab So just go like you know Your browser tab is the one that's over at the far right Okay let's now go back To PC Recruiter I have it under my favorites Yeah I see a little shortcut over there too so maybe that's it. Okay. Okay, let's hit login. Okay. Okay, now show me what, yeah, yeah, show me what was going on now. Let's see. Okay. Select. and delete. Now I can hit OK. Did you fully exit Chrome before and then go back to PC Recruiter? I use Edge. I keep saying Chrome. Edge. Did you fully exit Edge and then go back to PC Recruiter? I'm not certain. Here's the other thing. Let's see. And now I can send email. Yeah, we had to clear the cache. All I had to do was... Yeah, you had to clear the cache and then log out, log in. Sometimes, too, even like restarting your computer would just do it because that should like automatically clear your cache anyway. But I did that. I did redo it. Oh, okay. But maybe your cache, I think it depends on somebody's settings on your computer. And that didn't change it. All right. Sorry? So, yeah, so clearing the cache in the browser seemed to fix it. Okay. You should be good now. All right. All right, Robin. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You are welcome. All right. Have a great weekend. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye.",
