Maybe I can add that in as well, but we both agreed that maybe we could save some of my training time for that purpose, and so that's kind of where we are right now. Great. And yeah, it does last for six months since you purchased, but you have a few more months. But yeah, anything you need, reach out to him, or if there's anything you need with anything, feel free to reach out to me as well. Okay, so let me make sure I understand that. So I have six months to use that training, and how many more months do I have left? Let me take a look and see when, because usually I'll open up the ticket, because usually they will put that in there. Maybe I got that somewhere. Let's see. onboarding let's see it it was entered four months ago on May 5th June July August October November so it looks like it's good through November 5th that's when your training would expire so you do have some time yeah November 5th he's got it on there so yeah anything you need between now and then just reach out all right it looks like you have about eight eight hours left it looks like oh wow okay eight hours left all right okay well I probably need to get something scheduled in with him oh no that says hours used is eight so you have two hours left. Okay. Yeah. Two hours left. But yeah, if anything you need, just let him know and that's good through October. Okay. November 5th. November 5th. Gotcha. Okay. Very well. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a great day. All right. You too. Bye-bye. Bye now.",
