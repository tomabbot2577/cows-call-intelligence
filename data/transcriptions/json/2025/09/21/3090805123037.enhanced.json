    "text": " Hey, Robin, what's up? Oh, nothing. Just loving life. That's not the conversation. I think you heard what you wanted to hear because I don't think anybody's letting you out of a three-year contract. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no. I said to put on hold to hold on to our case in case we go through the migration in the future. I don't see any notes on that. I see, yeah, we put you on hold for $10 a month, which is cheaper than everybody else. but you have a three-year contract. Exactly. That's not how that works. I'm very surprised by your response. Yes, because it's always me. Forget that you signed a contract. Right. That has nothing to do with it. It's my fault for not letting you out of the contract that you signed. Yeah. Well, at least you didn't call me the C word. I'm just like, I can't believe these people. Like, they take personal shots at me because of what they signed. It's just humorous anymore. Yeah. I mean, at least, like, with that woman, clearly she had a lot going on. Like, that doesn't excuse it, but it wasn't just for no reason. A lot of these people, I swear, are just like, no, I just don't like you. So I'm going to say nasty, mean things because you're not doing exactly what I want you to do. Yeah. You signed a contract. This is so false. Like this one about Jim Liberto. Well, he hasn't signed in. We don't care if they sign in or not. I think this guy's using us to get a visa. Because he has to start up. Yeah, that one, I'm like, hmm. So I saw his little note. Just ignore that. We're not doing that. I am not about to let him just like. First of all, he already shouldn't have had access to the database before he really started paying us. Because that didn't make sense to me. well i remember the conversation and i might be a little off on this he's trying to get a visa but i don't think it's us i think it's to canada and they have to kind of say like like i have a business so wow yeah let me just spend two grand and say i have a business like are we getting used like you can you can start your business yeah if that part of it is really irrelevant to the contract that you signed yeah is he trying to get out of his he's not the one trying to get out of his thing you're just saying the one that jim was like oh just want to keep pushing back his billing like he paid he signed he paid because he needs that for this visa stuff well you're signed and paid and you're going to get you know we already kind of pushed it back a little bit once. Wait, wait, wait. He said that's not what Jim said in my, hold on, hold on. I must have misunderstood. So he wants to get it pushed, the next recurring push back again. Well, I thought he said that he had. I am not pushing it back. A year in advance. Is that true? but the next one he wants to push that out which means we don't get anything so what would be the next recurring in april has already pushed back a little bit we did push it back a little bit but then i want to put you back a little bit more so that means we're really not going to get another payment then even though he's not using for from april next year until like so yeah we won't have anything for basically covering april to january 2027 if we push it back even more for his next recurring like he paid up front because he needs this to get his visa stuff going like we're getting used for visas what it sounds like you're going to start a business after you're here well then you shouldn't sign a contract and it's not our problem if you're trying to get a visa you don't like we gave you access to a database that's what's in your contract and no i'm not pushing this back anymore okay hold on so it doesn't matter if you're logging in or not i don't really care there's a lot of people that don't log in and they still have to pay you signed a contract you shouldn't have signed a contract if you weren't ready and if you need this for your visa well then that's just you know an expense that you have these make keep making exceptions i'm done with it i'm done with these exceptions yeah also this is how things get all screwed up and crazy and also why does he think he gets to tell you whatever whatever whatever not in charge of him but um he shouldn't have sent a contract just for visa purposes. Well, no. Lombardo's last response to you is basically telling you just make the payment received start in January. Well, no. January 27. January 27 is what he'll write. That's not how that works. That's so stupid. I think we should make him re-sign a contract in when he starts. So let's say January. And then at that point, let's see. So he did, so April was when he originally signed up. Is that right? Yeah. Let me look at, what was the company name? It's like something weird. VXZON. I really need to go grab my readers. Yeah. He, his invoice was April 15th, 2025. Okay. Okay. So that invoice is for his ASP installation of $750, 12 months of $115 per month with a discount of 5%. So that took off $69. So he paid $2,061 on April 15th of 2025. So really his next recurring should be April 15th of 2026. Okay. Now, Jim already had me push it back to August because then he's like, oh, I think we're going to have a little delay. Let's push it back to August. Now he's wanting to go to January. So that really means we'll have an annual payment from 4-15-2025 and not collect any more money until January 1st of 2027. Not doing that. The guy signed a contract, plain and simple. I'm ready to just get pissed off and say, no, his next invoice is April 15th, 2026. I already pushed it back once I'm not doing again right because that just doesn't that entire thing doesn't make sense I'm not understanding yeah this is how things get screwed up and I'm no I'm done sorry I'm just being crabby no no I agree with you I don't think that that's right. I don't think that that's fair or make sense anyway. So I would say I have it in a note here. So I at least remember customer paid for one year for 15 when I start using until September 25. Crater recurring, which already like, like, Jason already was like, what's happening with this? And I was like, I don't know. I didn't make that call. And I'm not. Yeah. That's not my thing. No. If he chose to do it that way because of his personal need, sorry, that's on him. He's more than welcome to cancel it or put it on hold after this initial agreement. But no. I think what probably makes sense. So if he had gone on hold for that entire time, it would have been $20 a month, right? So that would mean that starting, let's say he starts in January, right? And he would have paid the one year up front in January. It would be eight months. No, April, April. Okay, yeah. Eight months for like not getting any payment. Yeah. So that's like if he was on hold, that would be like $160. So I would say we have him re-sign. That's all he has to pay. Like he already paid. That's fine. We can apply his yearly. He would just need to pay for like a delayed start. And that would be it. Like it can be, and if we want to make it even, it can be like $150. But there has to be something in there for him like getting access to it. and we're hosting it and him not starting. Yeah, he signed. That's the issue I have, yeah. Because... So from April 15th. Okay, so May 15th to January 15th, hold fees. That's what I was thinking. And then start regular billing. Yeah. But we'll want to probably run that by Bill. Yeah. That way he doesn't, because if I, if we don't bring it up to Bill and then it goes to Lombardo and then Lombardo brings it to Bill and then Bill decides to do his favorite little thing of undermining us, then it's going to be really annoying. So. Sometimes I'd rather just. I know, but Lombardo will, and so then he's going to go through and be like, well, the other one we need to discuss, I almost rather. It's the one that, like, well, have them send a cancellation letter. I think we just void it and move on because, so I'm not really sure what happened on this because there were some invoices that were voided, and then they started kicking in, I don't know if they paid them and then like, and then now they're just sick of, you know, keep getting paid. For another one. That was another one. Um, hold on one second. Who is that one? We don't. Yeah. Yeah. We'll come back to this BXV. What was that old Disney channel? TTI has been in it. I'm not sure I used to listen to it. Um, what is this one? Let me see. What am I thinking of? Okay, let's go over this one first. Good Samaritan Haven. Is that the one where he's like sending invoices? No. Oh, I know what you're talking about. He just responded to me, I think, yesterday about it. I found that email from whatever. It got buried somewhere. they've paid recently but they he contacted me after they paid last but not before um after the last time they paid and the issue with it was um they're up in i don't remember may that's the one too where the contract signer was gone and then some other girl was trying to help. I remember going back and forth with Josh because this girl kept trying to ask for access. And we were like, who is she even? And then that Darren guy was gone. But they are current. They last paid August 19th. Oh shit, I have a train at noon. I don't have much time to do this right now. So there's other things where they're like, Matt, yeah, they asked for like CSV exports or something like that. I thought I saw something. They – oh, this is – that was one of the things I had to ask about because I didn't know the answer to this. So no contract – no contact – no contractor information, like timesheets or anything, is in the backups that we give them? Is that true? I don't know. I don't know that. Yeah, that was one. They're looking to a download. So back in January, Sean talked to Lindsay Austin. They're trying to, what is this? What did Sean write here? I think Matt they offered to do a data return but it has to be listed by the person as a contract signer is no longer with a company so they need to have it updated the email Josh to reach out Josh try to keep reaching out to this Lindsay And then we had a bad invoice that didn't process and what else? And then Matt talked about exporting from roll-ups So my guess is they opted not to do a data return I think they had already done it maybe That's what I thought A role list would contain any data for placements made or timesheets with only the company information. And then there's an activity here for cancellation request from you. I'm trying to cancel our account. I'm trying to get all data downloaded. And I'm trying to count as being canceled how many months of a refund we can get. You're not getting any refund. Right. Exactly. That was the whole thing. It's that then I was, I don't remember if we were supposed to have Bill talk to them or if I was going to talk to Bill about what the deal was. They did a data return. Okay, they did do it. I'm looking at tickets now. I was looking at activities. We will need all the information downloaded, their attachments, whatever. Oh, that was one. Yeah, this lady tried to get the timesheet stuff, and we're like, who are you even? Yeah, there was nothing in here about canceling. They asked for data returns, but no cancels. Right. Annoying. Annoying. Annoying. Annoying. I have to do this training in seven minutes. Okay. I'll get... I'm almost done with the training. I'm going to go to the next slide. I have to do this training in seven minutes. Okay. I'll get it. I'm almost done with this cancellation letter. And then I put the other one in there that you asked for, the ACH or whatever. Yeah, I just got to figure out who these go to now. I wish the billing email was separate because I hate it when they're all mixed in with my other ones. Why don't you just separate them in your thing? Like, if you put a filter on it and put a label, then you'll be able to click on one of these. Yeah, I try to. Yeah. Yeah. It'll just do, if you just do from, or if you just do to billing at main sequence.net as the, like, only filter, it'll just throw them all into that. It's like a bucket. Yeah. It's. Oh, I have, well, I have, I can't really, I don't really want to do that too much. Only because I already have other ones that are, like, from billing. like if they are failed payments or things like that there's a whole bunch of stuff in there if you have more criteria than that though like if you have like this and this and this it'll just put multiple labels on it so like I have my fresh mask but then I also have like my ad users and other ones like I have them broken down separately I have like a thousand of these but it makes it easier when I I like applying a label at the time but if I think I'm going to get to it within 10 minutes and then I don't that's when the problem starts so i just have to work my way backwards is the problem yeah that makes sense so sometimes like things come in waves you know it'll be nice and manageable and then all of a sudden boom that was my afternoon like like everything like around like after our support meeting between four and five i had people like ellie lady calling and then somebody else was like they all wanted me at the same time the nick ferrara from craft services with his very vague oh i have a custom project let me let me know when we can talk to get started on this like i don't even know what you're talking about i'm not committing to anything you're like no oh and can we get you additional users at a discounted rate no your user rate is 75 only a four what are you in like 100 you can trying a new contract. Right. Also, that was a real email because I did see that and I went, I don't know. It went to my spam. That's why I wasn't sure. He's trying to get additional users at a discounted rate. That's already a thing. They already have a tier system for their users. What is he talking about? You mean for job.com, right? or for whatever they are. No, craft services. They only have four users. Oh, craft services. Oh. Actually, Nick Ferrara, he's actually had his own account. Now he's with craft. And yeah, like, no, they pay $3.96 a month. Really? And there is no tier. You're like, that's going to be a no from me. Yeah. That's a no. I think only job.com really has been. And I built it into the template, the recurring template, so it's easier to understand. Users 1 through 20 or whatever the number is, this rate. And then I have two more rows for the next two scales and they just have the number of zero. And that way it's easier. And I put a note in the customer area. Because I am not digging through a thousand activities trying to find details for that. Definitely not. No, no, no, no. I don't know why they didn't use the note area more before. The billing notes, you mean? Just the customer notes area, like when you open up something in QuickBooks, like a customer. Oh, yeah. I have no idea. That also very much confused me because, I don't know, I don't get it. A lot of these people, they don't even have an email address. I'm like, if they have an email, I'm sorry, not email address, a physical address. I'm like, if they have any address at all, that was probably me putting it in because They just were not doing that. That's so crazy to me. Because one of the first projects I did for PASI was trying to figure out where people in Ohio, like what state, like how much money we got per state and stuff. And it was a nightmare. And I started putting some addresses in. Crazy. Yeah. I'm surprised how many, like, I'm sure there's a ton that still don't have any. yeah I asked I did have to be sugar induced a couple of them but it like there's they didn't even put like display name and company name they would just put like one never a person name it was like that display name I think is how it was email address and then the invoice that was it which makes no sense at all whatsoever yeah yep a little extra effort folks well like but then it like messes you up later like that's the thing is if it was like not something that was that it had to be super aggravating for them too like hello like I started putting things in like you know when did they cancel soul? When did they, you know, when did they go on hold or, you know, literally there was hardly anything like that. You might go in there and see like, you know, some of their contract services, like, there's hardly anything in there. Oops. I got to go. I'll give you a call back after this training. Okay.
