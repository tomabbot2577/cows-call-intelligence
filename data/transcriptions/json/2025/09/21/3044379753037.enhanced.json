Just looking to walk you through the platform here, if you have some time. No, actually, I'm with a company called PC Recruiter, and we just were looking over your page to maybe integrate with our software, but I actually still am on the clock, so I wouldn't be able to take a look at it any further. But yeah, basically my supervisor, I just passed it up to him. He's just looking over some of this AI, checking that out. Yeah, if you have any questions, feel free to give us a call back. Awesome, that sounds good. Thank you so much. Have a good one. Bye. Bye.",
