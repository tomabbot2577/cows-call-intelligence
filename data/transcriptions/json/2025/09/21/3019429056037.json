    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Guys, be quiet. I'm going on speaker because my phone is broken. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise... You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Good afternoon. Hello, Damon. How are you? Good afternoon. Pretty good. How about yourself, Jim? I am okay. My Zoom and phone just went unresponsive as I tried to start the meeting, so I apologize for my delay. How about yours? So, yeah, so I wanted to kind of talk with you a little bit about what was going on and what you were looking to do and PC Recruiter, next steps, or how I can help. Yes, so my wife Ann Marie is also on the line here. Okay, hello. Ann Marie, how are you? She's a co-owner of Elite. So, we're at the point where we have to identify our vertical market and the team that dimensional search is ready to import that information into PC Rebooter. We haven't acquired that tool yet. So I wanted to get an understanding of what that entails and what's the next steps. Excellent. Excellent. Okay. I didn't know. I suspected you might have been dimensional search, but I wasn't for sure. Yeah. So that is very good. So, yeah. So with the dimensional search, obviously you all get a discounted rate. We can get you set up relatively quick. Are you going to participate in the training class on the 4th of August? In September. Oh, September. Okay. Okay. You're my first for the September class. My wife is in the class right now because she's approaching her last meeting. okay excellent excellent yeah i i'm just coming in new because i think you were working with josh before that's that's correct perfect briefly well we've spoken like it's probably too soon to talk about it but at this point we're we're closing in on the time awesome awesome so did you want me to draw the paperwork up to get it sent over to you to review and then if you're ready to go, we can sign it. And then once the invoice is paid, within a day or so, we'd have the database link set up and ready to go. Yes, it would be great to see the quote. Will we also, do you offer the aspect of a, I guess, a demonstration of the tool and what that looks like? Yeah. Yeah. I could hop in here and show you around a little bit right now if you'd like. Yeah, that would be great. Perfect. Perfect. Absolutely. So let me share my screen here. And do you hear me okay? Yes. Okay. Fantastic. Fantastic. So, yeah. So PC Recruiter, mine might look a little bit different than what you would use because Dimensional Search, you have the great added benefit of that they have some formatting. They have some templates and stuff that they put forth. So they do give you some additional. So mine might not look exactly like yours. Okay. And my Zoom isn't sharing. Let's see. Do you see my screen or not yet? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Are you still there now? Yes. Okay, let me get back in here because I'm having a lot of technical difficulties today. Like it just froze my machine again and shot me out of Zoom. Oh, no. Let me try and open it back up. Yeah, so with dimensional search, I was going to say with dimensional search, the nice part is they pre-populate the database with a specific template of fields and some information. I don't know what all they have in there, but you do get a little more than just an empty PC recruiter database. and then they also take your data and they input the data and they kind of would pull it in for you a lot of times and then you also have not only our training team here but they have a training team that trains you on the usage of pc recruiter and all sorts of other nuances of everything okay let's see i am i can't even get into zoom back again for some reason i'm all i'm gonna have to reboot everything. Like my phone died, my Zoom's locked out, I'm all mixed up. Do you have any availability tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. The demonstration, can we set up time with you to take a look at what's in? Absolutely. What if we did tomorrow? Would 11 a.m. Eastern work? No. Okay. Do you have any time in the afternoon by chance? Yeah, I could do one or two Eastern. And Marie would 12 work. This is what I was saying. 12 work. I mean, I can try to make that work. Okay. And Jim, you think it's about a 30-minute demonstration? Yeah, I could get it in 30 minutes. Okay. Let's plan for that. Perfect. And are you all Central Time, Eastern Time? What time zone are you in? We're Mountain Standard. Mountain. Okay, okay, perfect. So we'll do 12 Mountain to Eastern? Yes. Fantastic. What I'll do, I'll get my Zoom rebooted. I will create a new meeting. I'll email you over the new meeting for the correct time tomorrow. And we could spend a half hour, take a look at the system, answer any questions. And I'll just need to collect your company name and address. And then I'll email the paperwork for however many users we can get that going tomorrow when we talk. Okay. Sounds great. Excellent. I'll get that over to you in a little bit. And I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow. Absolutely. All righty. Thank you both. Sorry for my difficulties today. No worries. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
