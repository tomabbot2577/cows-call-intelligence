    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Thank you. you you Hello, John, how are you? Hello. Good, how are you? I am well. You've got Jim here, and I think Jason just joined as well. Yep, I'm here. Excellent. Thank you, gentlemen. Excellent. Glad you could connect with us today and wanted just to kind of get you started here on your PC recruiter training journey. So what we're going to do today is there's a few questions that we've got to go through and figure out how you're going to utilize the system. Jason's got a kind of brief questionnaire to run through. We're going to take a look at that, go through some questions there. and we know kind of the basics of what you're looking for since your dimensional search. We know that you're going to need RingCentral and HireEasy, so we know some of the basics. There's just a few extras that we have to ask. And then at the conclusion of today's call, Jason's going to get a couple of sessions on the schedule for you before your training session, which I think is October 6th. Is that when that happens for you? For dimensional, yeah. That's when I start with dimensional training. Yeah, they were telling me at least get the first of this training under my belt before I get there, possibly two, but at least the first one. Yeah, I think they normally try to go for two usually. But, yeah, so I would be a point person. If you ever needed to add users to the system, pop me a quick email. I can help with that. Or if you don't know who to talk to, I can get you assistance from anyone here. And then Jason's going to be the primary person for training us and how-tos and everything like that. So he would be a point person to reach out to. Okay. So what I'll do, let me go ahead and turn everything over to Jason to go through the questions that he has and get those first couple of calls on the schedule. Sure. Perfect. Awesome. So, like, hi, John. I'm Jason. Like Jim said, I'm your PCR trainer. The questions I have are just going to kind of help guide me through our training process to make sure that I'm hitting all of the beats that you need. The first piece is going to be what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing? like contract placing, permanent placement, what in that area? Yeah, so obviously permanent placement. I also do want to do contract placement. I think I'm focusing on permanent initially just because it's easier to get in, right? But a big part of me joining Dimensional was the structure around contract placement. Okay. So I'm going to be doing both. Okay, okay, cool. Cool. And is there a particular industry or niche that you're going to be focusing in? Yeah, I'm going to focus in commercial construction. I'm going to start with an engineering consultant, consulting engineering, and then branching out among other commercial construction industries. Okay, cool. Have you worked as a recruiter before? 20 years. Okay. Yeah, I've got a lot of experience. Okay. Within the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? No, I don't think so. Okay. Sorry if you have to answer myself. Have you worked with a CRM before? Oh, many, yeah. Okay, okay, cool. So it's a familiar idea. Yep. Okay. So the next one's going to be about training speed. We have three different levels. So we could go at slow, moderate, or fast. The training sessions are going to be an hour long each. Fast would be three a week. Moderate would be two and slow would be one. I know we want to hit those first two before the dimensional search training comes up. So we'll definitely schedule those two. But do you think you want to do them like one a week or two a week? Like what do you think is going to work with your schedule? Let's just do one a week for my schedule just because I'm a little crazy right now. And I should be able to pick up on a lot anyway, so I'm not terribly worried about it. But outside the first two, like you said, let's do one a week. I think that just makes more sense. Okay, perfect. And that's not set in stone. If we ever want to pick up the pace, we absolutely can. Okay. What operating system are you using, Windows, Mac? Windows. Windows. Okay. And what browser are you currently using? I use Chrome. Okay. And your email provider, Gmail, Microsoft? Like you use Outlook or Gmail? I use Outlook. It's Microsoft, yeah. Okay. I'm sorry, because my personal email is Gmail. I'm just confusing myself. I finally got everything converted to my work email and my business email. So now I'm trying to focus solely on that. Right. Okay. Let me just make sure I got everything. So your website, usually with people with dimensional search, where they are with their website, is they have the intention of having a website, but it's currently being built. Is that where you are? Yeah, we're in the process of building it. Okay. Awesome. Okay. It's pretty close, actually, believe it or not. Okay. Awesome. This last one, in terms of just kind of how you like to approach things, that's just going to give me a better idea on different things that we could touch on. Do you like a more manual approach? Do you like an automated approach? Or do you think it'll be a little more falling in between somewhere? Approach to the training? Just kind of like, no, like contacting people, keeping up with your clients, business development, those kind of things, like when you're working in your process. yeah i mean i'm like a combination because you know i'm going to reach out to people directly but i'm going to want a system that's going to really help me organize you know my calls my scheduling uh okay if the system's able to say you know i can set it up so you know we're going to contact this group this day this group this day it's going to send an email this day whatever the case is that's fantastic obviously i'm going to pick up the phone myself and call them but Yeah, that automated scheduling help will save me a lot of time from having to do it. Perfect. Yeah, we can absolutely do that. I'd just like to ask that question because sometimes people don't really like automation. So I'd just like to make sure I'm aware of how they feel about it. Whatever's going to save me time. That's my thing. Perfect. Okay. So why don't we get the first two scheduled, and then we'll kind of revisit after that. what does, first off, what time zone are you in? I'm in Eastern. Eastern, perfect. I don't mind doing it after my hours because actually that's easier because I'm still, because Jason, I'm still working. So I'm going to try and be balancing everything. So I will have time after hours too. Okay. I am available until 5 p.m. So what works with you before then? okay um well we'd have to look at specific days just because i have to fit into my schedule are you thinking next week um i have uh wednesday thursday friday this week and next week is pretty open as well so whatever makes the most sense for you oh okay good um friday let's um now friday's terrible day what am i talking about how about just trying to work my way sports schedule Thursday. I can't do that. I can't do that. Can we do Thursday, this Thursday from you said it's an hour? Yeah, it'll be an hour long. Thursday from two to three for the first one. Okay. And I'm going to walk off the rest of my afternoon so I don't so I don't So I could absorb it a little bit. So hold on. I'm just blocking this off right now. So, yeah, this Thursday, 2 to 3 Eastern would be great. And then let's take a break. Let's go to next week. Actually, let's do Tuesday. I think that makes it easier. Yeah, Tuesday, could you do 10 a.m. to 11? Yeah, I could do that. I'm just putting out my personal and business and work calendar so I don't have a meeting scheduled by somebody who wants to annoy me. Okay. The email that we had contacted for this meeting, the JBS recruiting, that's your work email, correct? That is my business email, yes. Okay, cool. Because I'm also going to send you an invite. I throw it on my calendar as well. I won't ignore yours. Don't worry. I'll talk about my company. I'll ignore that. Yeah. Perfect. So the invite I'm going to send you is going to have a link inside of it to join the meeting. And we'll just do all of our meetings through that Google Meet setup. And one more thing, that first session, it is going to be fairly administrative. There's just some stuff we have to set up, like creating users and connecting email, all that stuff. So just anticipate it being a little administrative. but the second session is going to be diving into the specific functions of PC recruiter, general tour, all that fun stuff. But yeah, that's all I have. Do you have any specific questions for me? Yeah, I was actually, I'm glad you said that because I was thinking maybe I'll jump in now that I have my login, I'll jump in and start playing around. But you think I should wait until we get that first session done so we set it all up properly? I would say feel free to hop in and take a look around, get familiar, click around, do all that fun stuff. But in terms of setup, it makes the most sense that we're going to create a user that's specific to you. And I want to make sure we do that together so it all sets up correctly. But with that admin user you were provided, definitely feel free to log in and just kind of get yourself familiar with it. Okay. Yeah, I think I'll poke around. That was what I was planning to do tonight, poke around a little bit and just kind of see how similar it is to other CSRs. It's kind of a combination of a CRM and an ATS from what I understand, right? Yeah, yeah. There's a combination of features inside of there. The pipeline has a lot of the ATS features that we'll get into specifically. If it's helpful, in the top right corner, once you log in, there's like a profile picture with a gear on it. If you click on that gear, you can go to the Learning Center. I'll also just email you a link to the Learning Center. that can be helpful to kind of help you guide through if you're going to be poking around all of the training that you do. I think you sent me an email with a couple links as well. It might have been in there. Yeah, it might have been in there. I always forget what the specific links are in that initial email, but it's probably in there. Okay, yeah, cool. Yeah, send whatever you have. If it's duplicate, it's duplicate. That's fine. Okay, perfect. Awesome. Anything else for me? No, I really appreciate it, and I'm looking forward to catching up with you again on Thursday. Awesome. Jim, do you have anything else? I do not. I am all set. We look forward to getting you on board. Well, thank you. Thank you both for your time, and I really appreciate it. Awesome. See you Thursday, John. Thank you. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye now.",
