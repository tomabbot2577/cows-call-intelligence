    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi. I've got a technical question about email. Oh, okay. In PCR? Yes. All right. What's your name and what company are you with? Her name is Allie Laura, and the company is Comprehensive Player, Inc., doing businesses red sheets. Okay, got it. So what issue are you seeing? Yeah, so I changed the password on an email and it says it's working and then I get an error message, could not send, I've got the whole kind of thing copied and pasted, so it's something about authentication. Oh, okay. Let me log in under your username and check that out. What's your PCR username? CF. CF. All right. So I'll check your incoming mail connection, your outgoing mail connection. And it's for the resumes. I've got two emails set up. It's for resumes at Red Sea. Just the email that I'm having to deal with. Okay. Got it. Okay, resumes at Red Sea. Got it. Good. And then... Yeah, this is good. And the other one as well. Just wanted to check that. Yeah, they both look like they are set up correctly. Let's see. got invalid email credentials popping up as a notification, but that's from 10-24, so about a half hour ago. Those might be out of date. Let me try something out. I'm going to make a quick name record for myself in the database and try to email myself from your username to see all the errors that come up. Okay, created that. Just try to send an email, and I'm going to do it from, I'm going to remember to do it from the resumes one. Yeah, okay, I'm seeing that the error could not send mail, requested insufficient authentication scopes. Hmm, alright, so let's do this. Let's jump on a quick screen share and we'll just walk through reconnecting that. Even though it does have a positive connection, we'll just run through the steps again together and then maybe we'll have to jump over to your email provider, Gmail, and see if there's any settings we can find. Let's start with go to a new tab in your browser and then go to meetings.ringcentral.com. I'm not typing well. And meeting ID? Perfect. That is 127-513-849. And if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Entire screen, there we go. And you'll probably have to click on like screen one to highlight it and select it and then hit share. Oh, okay. There we go. That's loading. Yep, I can see that. So if we go back to, go back to PCR and let's start by having you go to the system settings. Yep, perfect. And email setups on the left. email alias list. There we go. And click on the pencil icon next to the one we want to edit. And just click sign in with Google, the blue box there. Good. All that looks good. Yep. Okay. Very normal. Nothing strange happened there. Hit test connection. And that's still saying it's good. Okay, close that test and then hit save. And I'll try my test again on my end. One second, just sending to myself from your database. Oh, it did say it sent, I think. Let me check my inbox. Interesting. Yeah, I got it. I'm trying to just send here. Let me just do my little... Yeah, let's make sure it's working. There you go. It worked that time. Weird. Oh, good. Okay. All good. Excellent. That's all I had. I just was like, I could not figure it out. Yeah, that was strange. It was giving you like a false positive on the test earlier. So I'm glad we got it reconnected. That's good. Okay. Yeah. Anything else you had trouble with or questions about? No. I've been a long time user. Everything works great. Thanks a lot. Awesome. Reach out if you need anything else. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye.",
