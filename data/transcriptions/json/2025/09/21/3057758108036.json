    "text": " Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. This is Nicole Mitchell from VMG. You just left me a call. I mean, hey, how are you? I'm well. I'm well. Thanks for calling back. Sure. Sure. Is this a good time to talk for a few minutes? Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to kind of see what questions you had and what you had heard about and what you were interested in learning more about. Gotcha. So I'll tell you what our end goal is, and then I've been asking Drew some questions as, you know, there are features or things that are available to kind of see, you know, what falls in where. So we are – so part of the arrangement is that we work with ASAP and I think work the system kind of differently. We're a government contractor, and primarily we're operating from the posting a position, you know, candidates responding, and then we're taking them through the pipeline to interview and to hire. Sometimes, and with one of the features that Drew is referring to, we will do passive sourcing. So we're looking to see, you know, obviously if we can find individuals. One thing that I mentioned to him that this most recent feature that he mentioned about the matches, we have used similarly with, are you familiar with Indeed Smart Sourcing? I've heard of it. Yeah. So essentially it's that you post the position and then by using that particular position, it will find matches for you based out of, you know, people who are out there. But one of the challenges is that you don't have contact information. Essentially, I'm, you know, kind of cold calling you. But that's why I said that was kind of the similarity, which we do like that option in terms of if somebody has not applied for the position, but we can go out there and find them. So what we're trying to do is we're incorporating AI into this process. So right now we're in a place where we're going to have, you know, somebody from our IT team. And for example, you know, we've got a position in there that has 171 resumes. What we're trying to get away from is having to manually review those 171 resumes, find the top 10, send them to the, you know, hiring manager in their presentation. So we've talked about creating an API to just pull information out of the database. There was a mention of the AI search function, which I understand has been turned on. I'm not quite sure how that part works. I'm assuming it's kind of a keyword search. And then most recently, you know, this process of being able to find matches. So our end game is sometimes it's a smaller number of resumes, but definitely when there's a large number of resumes or being able to go back into the system and say, I'm looking for an epidemiologist, right? I may have posted it in three different ways, but I'm looking for an epidemiologist for a new opportunity. Pause there and let me know if it makes sense. Yeah, it does, and it looks like our – so our upcoming auto-match should help to kind of give you that out-of-pc recruiter. So what the auto-match is going to do, So if I understand it, and I haven't seen it because it's due out in a week or two, but it is going to give you a button that you can click on any position in your database, and it will automatically bring back the best 15 or 20 records in your database that match the requirements of that position. So it will kind of pull everything right back, and it will show them, and I think if you give you the option to link them into the pipeline right from there to start reaching out to them, and it's only going to go from within your PC Recruiter database, thus it's going to be something that will help you to search your database so as you're getting people in have them submit their information or put their information in if they apply online to another job they're all going to then be part of your database and they're going to be able to be part of that search so they'll match and kind of bring you back a list of people there right right yeah like I said it sounds familiar to what the need offers but as you said you know the beauty of it, they would already be in our database. That's one of the questions I was asking Drew, that in some way, shape, or form, right, if we do have the capability that they're in there in whatever status, right, they may be in a pipeline, they may have applied to something else and just sitting there, but as long as we can tap into anybody that's in there, as you said, and then it looks for the matching for the position or for the description that we provide. Is that correct? Yeah. So once you have that job description, it's going to look for people that match that description. So that would be part of the AI search suite, which isn't anything you have right now in your database. Now, they have given it away for free for the summer to try the AI suite, but the search is something you have to have turned on because that requires a little bit of re-indexing of the database there. So I could get – oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was going to say I could get that in queue to turn that on for you, and then once the AI AutoMatch was available, it too would be able to be triable there. But if you then wanted to keep it, you would have to upgrade to the Premium Plus package. So there would be an upgraded package you'd need to keep it, but I should be able to get you a trial to give it a try. So difference between like in the just like the MyPCR when you got onto the platform, there was a mention of the AI search, right? And it wasn't something that was automatic. So we did have that turned on, but what is the AI suite? So that's losing and quite honestly, I'm not sure how to use the search at this point, but Tyler was helpful. and sent me articles of how to go about doing it. So, you know, I'm imagining like, again, keyword or something to that effect. So we have that turned on, but you mentioned the AI suite as opposed to just the AI search. So is this second piece what would be the rest of the suite or are there other things? well it actually so the the suite itself is comprised of four elements one is the ai search the second is the email generator so any email send screen you would there's a little ai button that'll generate an email there you also have a candidate summary generator and a job description generator. So those are the two other pieces of that. So those four pieces are the AI suite. And then the auto match is coming out. It's part of the AI search. So it's just another piece of the AI suite, but it includes, it requires the AI search. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. And I think I saw it in different pieces that hadn't, hadn't referred to as the AI suite. So yes, if we were to be able to try that match function. And I think because what we'll end up doing probably is kind of having things happen simultaneously. We're literally in the beginning stages of building out this system that we're going to use the AI agent and the API. But, you know, to have the built-in functions of being able to, you know, as you said go and search within our system without having to do the whole full or not having to but you know we may not have the need because as i say we vary sometimes it's kind of seasonal for us so this is actually the government's fourth quarter right so this is like the busiest time of the year what it typically is in terms of you know them extending rfps and um awarding contracts So we could very well, as we do now, we have a position, I mean, we have a proposal that we're working on that has 10 different postings on there and ranging anywhere from 9 to 170 applicants, you know, per position. so you know kind of stream like you say there we will figure out the the usage of it in terms of it but being able to not have we may not need have a need you know if there's 20 people to go and do the whole full ai ranking for us when we could use the search function you know or the match find candidates just you know kind of eyeball those and then decide if We're going to move them forward. So I think a long answer to yes, if we can, so that we can try out the search function and see. Like I said, they might just be sitting side by side with each other and give us the option of what we need, what's most appropriate for us to use for that recruitment or that posting. Yeah, so what I'll do, why don't I check you back in about a week just to make sure that the AI Automatch is there. I'm pretty sure it's going to be automatically there, but if it's not, I'll get it turned on when it's released. So I guess it should be next week. So I will ensure that it's there. Then we can let you take a look at it. And then if you do want to add it, we can explore the pricing to do so down the line. But we'll let you give it a try first, if that's reasonable. That sounds like a plan. Sure, perfect. I'll circle back about a week, maybe toward the end of next week when it should be out, give you an update then. And then we'll take it from there. All right. Sounds good. Thank you very much. I appreciate the follow-up. Not a problem. All right. We'll talk to you soon. Okay, thanks. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
