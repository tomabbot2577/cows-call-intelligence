    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Todd Eikenberry. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I think you helped me with my training, maybe. I'm not sure. Yeah. So, hey, I just had a simple quick question. So somehow my username and my password, like, got taken out of my Google. So I just need to get re-logged in, and I don't have either. So, yeah, so there was no, like, way I could just said, yeah, invalid credentials. So there's no way I can, like, you know, normally you can work through that yourself with, like, an email and stuff, right? But I don't see any option to do that. So wait, so the issue is getting your email or is it logging into PCR? I just want to make sure. Logging in. I don't have my username or password now. Oh. It was memorized in Google and somehow it wiped it. Oh, do you use Google anymore? Because it might be. Did you check your password manager? That's what I mean. It's not coming up. Like, I think it somehow got cleared out. So I just need to get my username and password, then re-remember it. Okay. So here's the thing. I would prefer as a starting point to maybe make it easier, let's check your Google password manager. Otherwise, we kind of have to make you jump through a little bit of hoops here. We have to send you a password reset form that you have to electronically sign just to make sure it's you requesting the password change. We just got to do that to, you know, kind of protect our customers. Yeah. So let me first do this. I just want to be sure before I make you go through all that. Hold on one second. That's okay. I mean, I've been doing my other – this is just one of, like, 25 or 30 passwords I've had to do, so I'm pretty sure it's not in there. but how do I quickly do that? I'm sorry. Okay. Yeah. I, I, I gotta, I just want to make sure. So that's okay. Otherwise I'll send you the form. Cause the other thing too, is if we change the password, then you got to make sure like you have anything else connected to PC recruiter, like PCR capture, the outlook portal, all of that stuff. You're going to have to change the password in those two to make sure it can still be back. So I just want to make sure. All right. See if we can retrieve it because you can't retrieve a password. You can only reset it. All right. Well, I apologize for that. So how do I quickly check on that? All right. So here, I sent you a meeting invite. Okay. Just go into Outlook. Yeah, this was senseless. I don't even know how that happened. Let's see. Mail. Okay. Yeah. Join call. Yeah. okay yeah actually like there's like a link it'll say join join meeting okay should i put use microphone and camera or continue with that um you don't need to use the microphone or camera for our call because we're already on the phone and yeah okay okay i seem to be in there i guess going now okay just put you in okay you're in the meeting Okay, so at the bottom of this meeting screen, you should see a share screen option. When you click on that, it's going to pop up a window, go over to where it says entire screen, and then it's going to show you a preview of your screen. Okay. I hit entire screen. Okay, entire screen. And then it's going to show you, if you have more than one monitor, pick which one to show and then click share within that window. Okay. I did. Okay. All right. So let's go over to your PCR login page. Okay. Whoops. Oh, I said I left the meeting when I hit that. Yeah, I think you've closed the meeting window instead of going over to the other tab. So if you can go back into the meeting. Sorry about that. Okay. I don't even know how I did that. From the email that I sent you. No, I mean, I just have to do it out of a – I need to open another tab, I guess. Yeah, we're going back over to the original tab. Am I back on now? Yeah, but you're going to have to reshare your screen. Okay. Sorry about that. There it is. That's okay. Entire screen, screen two, share. Now I need to open a new tab, right? Or go over to one of your existing tabs. Just don't close the Meet tab. Okay. I'm just going to open a new one. Yeah, I think you try to, like, go from that tab. Okay. I went to the PCR, but, I mean, obviously you can't. I don't know if you can see it. Can you see it? Yeah, let's see. Okay, so you do still have your Google account. Okay. Okay. Let's do another new tab. Another one? Yeah. And type in Google Password Manager up at the top. Okay. Okay. Click on that choice. Okay. Click on that first option. because welcome gets started okay i think that password check yeah see these are the ones that i i don't know what ema plan is i don't even know what that is and you're in your google with your current account right yeah oh what about like you know work emails through google or no no this this somehow got wiped oh that's okay all right well we're gonna have to go the long way here. Let me do this for you. I'm on the phone with you, so we'll do it here together. I'm going to send you. All right, I apologize. That's okay. Documents new. Okay, we're going to do password reset form. I will try it. Before you do that, let me try one more thing just to see if I have it on a hard copy anywhere. That's cool. While you're doing that, whatever you're doing, Let me just look. I don't think I do. I figured I was just going to call and you were just going to say, hey, your login is this and whatever. You know what I mean? It would take one second. Yeah, we can't even see what they are. Okay. They're all masked for security. Like even if you made it three characters, as soon as you save it, as you type and as soon as you save, it's all dots. And despite the actual password length, it saves as like, I think, 10 characters. Okay, I'm just looking. Just give me one second because I didn't know this was going to be involved. I'm just looking to see if... I kind of thought I'd skimmed this though and did not see it. So just looking one more time. Got nothing in there. Okay. All right. Yeah, I don't think I have anything. Okay. Yeah, I don't think I have anything. Yeah, I guess we're just going to have to do this really quickly. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. At least you know if you had somebody that worked for you and you changed their password on them or disabled their account and they called us, you know that, like, we're going to say no. And we only do this with the person who signed the contract signer or who signed the contract. What's your job title? She likes to have that, I think, for some of these at least. President, I guess. Huh? What do you want to put that in? President. You can put that in. Okay. Yeah. Can you hang on one second? Sure. Sorry. Okay. Thank you.",
