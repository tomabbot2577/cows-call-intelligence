Yeah. Let's see, was that him? Yep, I accepted. Yeah, so he should be in momentarily. We should accept him. Sounds good. This is a dimensional search, so I can actually fill out most of these questions now. Yeah, they're a little nicer because we kind of know their basics. Right. I think he's the August class. Okay. That gives us a month. Awesome. And I don't have an email from him canceling or anything, so we'll give him another minute or two and then I'll call them up after that okay you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Give him a call because he's not joining in. Let me give him a call real quick here. All righty. I'll call. We'll jump back in. Cool. Actually, I'm just going to put you on hold, I think, and then dial so I can hop back in. If I get him on the phone. Oh, I see. Okay. Hang on just a quick second. All right. Okay.",
