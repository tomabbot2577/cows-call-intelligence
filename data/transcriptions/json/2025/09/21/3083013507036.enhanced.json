    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hello, Robin. This is Kurt. It's been a little while since I've spoken to you. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I have a question. I was trying to load an updated resume under a profile. Okay. And it keeps telling me that it was successfully loaded, followed by an error message that says that it's a duplicate. Oh. Do you happen to have it already under attachments on that record? Oh, I went into the record thinking, you know, troubleshooting this myself, and there are no attachment saves because I cleared it out, thinking, well, maybe that's the reason. So I've got, I can give you the name record or let's, maybe we'll get specific here. So let me know when you're in my database. The other thing that I've found, sometimes it's on a different record for some reason. So every unique file has like a CRC number. And what it means is that number is identified as being in the database. So it might just be on a record. Sometimes just like renaming it or maybe make it an extra. I did that too. I renamed the file on my desktop and then tried to go grab it and save it. I mean, short of taking the guy's name off, I took off, like, you know, the city he was in. Oh, that's unique, I didn't know. What's, like, the person's address? Their address is? It's, like, something unique that would probably only be in their resume. Well, his address is 15 Stonewall, one word, Stonewall Way, W-A-Y. That's probably unique. and that's in New Hampshire. Coming up, but you have keyword version two. So, okay. Not in the resume. It's probably an attachment somewhere. Yeah, maybe you got put in the wrong spot by me. But if I'm trying to save it under a different person, why would the system traffic top me into not letting me do that? Probably because of that CRC number. Can you send me the resume that you're trying to do? Okay. That'd be super helpful. Hang on a second. Let me get to my Outlook here. Write new email. And what's your email again? robin, R-O-B-I-N, at mainsequence.net. I just noticed in the file name I double-dotted something, but I don't think that's any different. That might. I put his last name and then it's dot dot. Try changing that. I'm that possibly could be throwing something off let me see if that works resume upload select well still says VV Rick Dax Cola that Doc's uploaded successfully then it says error duplicate resume detected but under his name record there are no nothing in resume or attachments so that's what's got me scratching my head here it's a mystery Downloads, where do I see that? Downloads. Oh. Rename. Okay, let me write some scripts maybe. What's that? I'm going to try running some script here and see if I can figure out maybe what would I be looking for? I'm going to try throwing it under attachments and see what happens. Saving it as an attachment and going through that. I just want to see if it kind of does it there too. okay that let me upload it okay and I took it off there okay do you ever have this person in your debt room maybe that's not it I'm thinking out loud I looked I looked to see if there was a duplicate record and there wasn't I was thinking the same thing so I'm gonna go probably smaller database of mine see how I want to write this script see if I the table I need to look in it's pretty extensive trying to get an example here Okay, we're description or file underscore name. Thank you. permission. Thank you. Thank you. So basically somewhere in the system there's a saying there's a file that we can't load on it, this individual's record, even though it's a different record that it may be tucked away under or are we thinking it's possibly buried in this guy's record somewhere that won't allow me to load it again it's one of two things right yeah and usually if you go through and like modify like make some changes it kind of makes it like a a new file yeah that's just kind of weird can we do a screen share what's that yeah i can do that sure do you have ring central by any chance? I think I do, yep. Central meetings. Okay. Open that up and click join. Robin, I can't hear you. I don't know if you moved your headset or something. Okay, sorry about that. Open up your meeting app and select join. I can't hear you. can you hear me now you okay no you can hear me now uh super silent it's like you went into soft mode i wonder if i hit my headset yeah now it's a little better okay oh bam there you are oh sorry enter the meeting id is what okay is it better now the volume oh yeah i had to turn it actually so I think I my headset has a court it's not cordless so there's a little pot in the middle and I think I leaned up against my desk I'm so sorry about that okay zero five zero three nine four eight one zero I'm really kind of stumped on this one usually I've invalid so let's try it again join a meeting 0 5 0 0 5 0 3 9 4 4 8 1 0 8 not coming up okay it's maybe I'm hitting there's missing a space or something so one more time and I'll insert a space okay 0 5 0 0 5 0 3 9 4 9 4 8 1 0 8 see that that is making three digits four digits two digits is it supposed to be that format or is it supposed to be three three digits because for some reason when I'm keying it in it creates a space 0 5 0 space 3 9 4 8 1 0 but the 8 wants to connect to the 3 9 4 and I'm trying to put a space in it. Try not to do a space just type the digits and it should be. which I did that great yeah and I'm hitting and it says meeting ID please check and try again all right I'm in there try another meeting and it's like give me a different ID maybe it didn't like that one that's my personal ID that's going here I'm going to send you a link to it let's see if that works Actually, this one I'll just have it with my name. So let's see. We'll try this way. And it's, let's see. Go back in. You're going to need to go in. Okay. Are you sending me an email? It's krudolph at I-R-G, Ice Robert George, and the word search, krudolph at I-R-G, search.com. Yeah, just use the same email that you just emailed me from. Let me know when you got it. All right. I'll look. Yep, I got it. Opening it up. Open Central. Black screen for now, but working on it. All right, join audio by computer. Don't join with computer audio since you're already on the phone. Okay, I just did so I won't. You just mute it then. Sometimes you might get like some interference. Okay, so let's see, camera, no camera, share screen. Share screen. Got it, okay. So I need to show you or find the screen that has PCR on it. Yeah, when you go to show screen go up to entire screen. Entire screen, okay. Let's find which one has, close some of this stuff down so I can actually see it. Okay. Windows. I didn't have PCR open, so that might explain it. Can you see PCR opening? No, I can't see your screen yet. You're not sharing it yet. Okay. All right. Let's go back to find out where that shirt screen thing was. I don't know if I, when I minimized all this, if it ended up closing that or not. There it is. Okay. Finally screen to share. Okay now you can see it right? Not yet. Sharing your screen it's about to do it. Sometimes it takes a moment. There it's starting to flip over. So you can see here... It's still trying to share. Hold on one second. now it's funny okay let's go into the file yeah I was in the record there's nothing under resume nothing under attachments there's no resume so what I would do is I go to upload document mm-hmm I tried that too and let me it's doing something funky again are you there yes I'm here can you hear me yeah quiet again so I don't know what what's cooking but this is the this is it on my desktop so if I click on this I get this hi Robin if you're talking can you hear me now no you're back to really quiet so I don't know if you bumped something or whatever you did to correct it the last time or whatever you moved. Better? Nope. What is going on? Hold on one second. I'm trying to turn it up on my end, but I think I'm about at that top volume level. Can you hear me? Bear with me. Yeah, bear with me. I'm going to do a little. No, it just bounced. You're back again. Whatever you did just now, you're back like crazy. So you can see this is what was my prompt for the call was nothing in the record, and I've changed the record on my desktop a couple different times. It's saying it's uploaded, but it's also uploaded or attempted to be uploaded again because it's already been uploaded, but the question is where. And if I change the record, why would I? I cannot find it. And I try to even do like a back-end search where any file, like the description had Scola. And it doesn't let me search by the file name. I think that's just to make sure that it doesn't, like people don't try to write scripts to replace file names because that could be very dangerous. Let's exit out of here. Let's open up the actual resume again. I'll bring it over to that screen so you can see it. I'm thinking it's got to be under attachment somewhere and I'm just, of course, I'm just not able to find it. It's opening up right now in Word. Recycling. I wonder if. Hold on one second. There it is. Scola. Oh. I know why. I think. Why? Maybe because it's in the recycle. Let's see. Name. Attachment. Okay. well that's there did you ever have this person maybe no I just got his resume in the last week having reached out to him but no I don't I never had his resume if you look at his or if I look at his activity okay so that was just the name attachment let's see the first time I ever spoke to him Yeah, it was just recently this month. So, I mean, if I got his resume, I would have been dropping it in, you know, last week. Okay. So, the one that I'm finding on a recyclable net, that's when I upload it as a test to attachments and then delete it. So, that's not it. Okay. Let's try. Let's open up the file. Let's just do more changes on it and let's see if that does anything for us. Let's open up the resume. Okay, it is open and you can see it. So you want me to change the name record or the name? I could just change it to test and leave it really simple. Yeah, let's go to file and go to save as. Okay, so I'm going to do this. Do you want me to save as or I can just change the name? Well, I might have you do a couple other changes too. Let's open up the file. Got it. I will do that. that I just got a new computer that I backed up yesterday so I can see why this one's going to need some okay so file yeah let's say there's anything else let's scroll down in here a little bit okay let's let's just try a couple things here. I'm going to open up big here. Okay, let's just roll down. It's a page and a half, so it's not like this huge, dense file. Maybe this formatting is a little unique. Let's add a couple spaces, something you would never even care or notice at the very end. Like at the very end of the file. Trying to make it like where it's definitely unique. Okay. There's. Okay. Yeah. Try that. Let's go file. Save as. Just test. Yeah. Let's just do, or just do like Rick's goal or resume. Let's just see what happens here. Okay, then save it. Okay, let's go back over to PCR. Let's try uploading this file. Okay. Thank you. well doesn't like that either oh gosh what is going on with this okay let's open up the resume the original one or the original one yeah it's either one since the contents the same really yeah okay I think there's got to be something with the properties of it as I say let's take it and paste it into a brand new Word document. All right. If you open up the original do like a control a. Yeah hold on a second I'm going to get it open then you can teach me the tricks here so control a you said. Control a control a should select all of it. And then control C is your shortcut for copy. Okay hold on one second I'll open up a new Word document. Shit. Now I think I lost it. I think I lost it. I think if you hover on your word icon down at the bottom, I think it should tell you anything that's open. Okay, hang on a second. I just think I opened Excel by mistake here, so hang on a second. Okay, so there's that. And now you're saying just hit Control-C. But I've got to open up another Word document. Yeah, so then go to File, New up at the top left. File, New. Then open it up and then hit Control-C, you said? Yeah, do Blank Document. Now you're going to do Control-V. If you've already copied the text, you're going to do Control-V. and that should paste what you copied in. Well, would it paste this? Not all the formatting. No, this is a completely different document. Okay. Close this. So I don't think it copied. Okay. Okay. Control-C is going to copy. That's going to copy. And then go to File, New. and control a blank document yeah control V is your shortcut for paste okay and now we'll try saving it again hold on one second so they keep all the format though I want to see if it okay good so go file save as a bass just gonna say resume maybe say Rick resume yeah I'm just helps you yeah this point I just want to get it over here and go back to work. I get it. I don't care what the name is because the customer's already got it. So for me, it's more of just getting it under his record and being done. All right. Save. Okay. And then close that. Oh, you need a file format. Okay. And then I'm going to go to Rick. And we're going to try resume. And we're going to try to hit, I mean, this is. You want to know a way that's even simpler? Over at the top right, there's a quick upload resume. You don't get all these extra, a little bit faster. Okay. Yeah. Let me go through that with you after I about get past this here, because that would be great. I'm all about saving time here. So resume, drum roll, please. No. All right, ma'am. Mm-hmm. do you you've got the resume do you want to noodle this since I think we've go to your DepCon 7 yeah I didn't figure out what the frick is going on here this is so odd I agree that's why I called the magic Robin the I've only had this happen like once or twice but all the little tricks that we did Let's do this. Let's go, because then it says something about saving and like a newer. Let's go back to your original file. I'm going to try one more thing. Okay. And then from there, I'm going to just. You're saying open that up, the original file? Yeah, let's go to the original. All right. I'm opening it up, and I'll bring it over to you. So you can see it. All right, there's the original file. OK. I'm going to save to this PC, this table design. OK, let's go File. Let's try save as Adobe PDF. I just want to see what this does. Okay. Now it's going to keep the other version, but it's going to give me a PDF version as well. Yeah. I didn't touch. Yeah, we didn't change anything. We're just doing a save as PDF. Is that opening on your other screen or something? Yes, correct. Welcome to Adobe Acrobat. So it brought me to Adobe Acrobat, but it didn't... I can't see it. I think it might be on your other window. Yeah, this is what popped up. So this is what came up when we did what we did, which is it brought me into Adobe, but it didn't bring up the file. so maybe I have to go to this on my desktop and do save as and just convert it to a PDF. That's saying not responding. So let me do this I'm going to go to the resume and I'm going to. You said you did something to your computer recently. Have you uploaded any other resumes today? No. These days? No this is all yesterday. I'm going to try this I'm going to go to there we go it's finally closing down I'm going to try to right-click and just where it says save as I'll leave the name the same and I'll just put it in Microsoft Windows and process like I think you're kind of locked up now maybe to something's locked up there that's spinning so I'm trying to figure out let's see if I can close Adobe here we may let's see air clothes the menus that let me it's spinning so whatever it's got a spin up to to be done I think that's where I'm stuck shut other stuff down let me just slow computer quicker I am gonna do this this one's still spinning Adobe does not like me right now so I'm gonna try save as this resume and see if I can open it as which I might not be able to do since Adobe is spinning wildly here and I can't figure out how to close it since I've tried everything. I don't know Robin I don't know how to. I have the file I might have to get I I might have to work with somebody else on this. I'm not really sure. Okay. Can I let you know what I find out? Yeah, sure. I mean, it's like I've got the resume. The customer's already seen it. It's not like this is, you know, people's version. Weird. It's just I think I've tried everything I can think of as short of what you were just suggesting, which was save it as a PDF, which I can try when my computer decides to stop clumping. Yeah, I'm going to try just uploading. And if that works, I'll let you know. And I'm going to go ahead and pin your – when you go to the resume section, you can even pin it to the front. It's called Quick Upload Resume. I'll pin it right up to your roll-up icon. What's really neat about it is if you go to resume, or now that I have it pinned on your other one, it's got like the little, it's like a cloud with an arrow, and it just takes you right to your browser. It's just faster. Okay, now I could use fast. It looks like it's trying to get in to convert to a PDF and open up right now, but you can see it's still grayed, so something's screwy. Yeah, this is just, it's just really, Download. Rename. Oh, well, I'm going to let you go. Okay. Alrighty. I will see what I find out. And I've got it on my desktop, and I've got, you know, if you can come up with any other alternatives if you want, and the consensus is save it to a PDF, I'll do that and try to load that once my computer's not screwy, and I'll let you know if that works. And if it doesn't, then that's one more box we checked. All righty. Sounds good. Thank you. Appreciate it, Robin. Bye-bye. All righty. Bye. Bye.",
