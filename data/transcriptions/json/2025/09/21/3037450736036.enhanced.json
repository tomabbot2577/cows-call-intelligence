    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Ken Burnett. I believe we have spoken before. I'd want to. Could you help me write a sequence? So generally we would send you to our learning center materials. I've read through those. Okay. Yeah, to build a sequence together, it would require some training hours. But if you have specific questions, I can answer if you're getting stuck on anything. Well, I am. I mean, I spoke to Robin yesterday, and I'm building a sequence for business development, and I mapped it all out in Excel. and what I want to do is first call I connect with somebody and what she suggested doing is creating a couple of different roll-ups so let's say I call somebody I speak to them and I hit the connect you know button they would then move on to the next roll-up because I've already talked to them I mean I don't want to talk to them until the next go-around okay when I was building the sequence and I added a step, well, when I wanted to add, you know, hit connect, move on to the next step, it goes to the next step or it creates another step. And I don't want that to happen because I want to call the people three times. Does that make sense? So, yeah, when you're adding in are you saying when you add in that call step on your sequence it'll plug in oh go ahead if i all right i have it labeled uh add a step okay i want to add a branch or call step yeah so when you add a new call step it'll automatically put in four conditions or what they're called underneath that step um you can delete those conditions or edit them so if the ones that were pre-loaded under that call step don't work. It sounds like you don't want it to go to the next step when you hit connect. What I want it to do is to go to the next roll-up. That would make sense. If you hit connected, you would have it move to another step and that step would be an add to roll-up step. so what I want to do is I want to put that step right after the call connected so I want to if I put in a call step it's going to populate it with a couple of pre-existing conditions so what I want to do is delete the other ones and put step 2 as going to the new roll up okay yeah perfect i'm asking you okay yes okay yeah yeah that sounds right so you would yeah you would have the call step and then you would put a step after that called an add to roll up step and um you can go back then to the call step and change the conditions to say if i click connected it'll move them to step two which is to roll up yeah right and then what i would do is what's And then that would be step two. What if I some cases I want to just leave a message and if I want to leave a message, then that would go to step three, which would probably be my next call. Correct. Exactly. OK, I understand. OK, that helps. Thanks. Awesome. Yeah. If you do get stuck on anything else, just let us know. We'll do our best to give you some guidance there. Awesome. OK, thanks.",
