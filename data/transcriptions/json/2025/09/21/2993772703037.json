I wanted to give you a quick call just to touch base here. I actually had a chance to talk with Bill Kubitschak, one of the owners of the company here, and he said that he spoke with you the other day and wasn't sure you were leaving, and I thought you were. and he also wanted me to see if you might want to take a look at PCRM, our new software piece that is kind of more of a CRM, but also has all that same ETS functionality the PC Recruiter has. So I wanted to give a call, see if you might give me 15 minutes to show you around that, at least give you a flavor of what it looks like. Totally different interface, but a lot of the same functionality, and maybe something else you're looking for. I don't know. Give me a quick call. Let me know if you're an A on that. I'm happy to show you around if you'd like. 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thank you, Jen. Love to talk to you. Bye-bye.",
