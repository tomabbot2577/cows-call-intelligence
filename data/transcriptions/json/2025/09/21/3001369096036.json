Hey, Lance, it's Jim Lombardo, PC recruiter. Got your voicemail a little bit ago today. I wanted to give you a quick call back. Try and connect with you. Just follow up. I thought I'd maybe connect you later in the evening, but I missed you. So give me a call in tomorrow. We are closed Thursday and Friday. I'll be back on Monday. But I'm in all day tomorrow if you want to try and give me a holler. My direct is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I'll probably try this tomorrow as well. I'll talk to you soon, sir. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
