    "text": " Thank you for calling me. Sequence Technology. Garrett, how may I help you? Yes, my name is Jennifer Nicholson. I'm calling from Southeast Mortgage of Georgia. We had a database with you all a few years ago, and I was wondering if we could get access to that database. Oh, so you're no longer a customer is what you're saying? That is correct. Okay, let's see. Let me see if there are salespersons available. They'll be able to let you know your options for looking at reopening the contract or getting the database again. One second. Okay. They are all on another call right now. Let me make sure I have your best contact information. We'll have somebody reach out as soon as someone's available. Let's see. So I have your current phone number that you're calling on, but also an email address at jennifer.nicholson at southeastmortgage.com? That is correct. Okay. I will have somebody reach out to you soon, and we'll get you reconnected there. Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks. Bye.",
