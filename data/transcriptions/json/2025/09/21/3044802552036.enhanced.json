    "text": " Thank you for calling MainSignals Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I am having problems with my PC recruiter interfacing with LinkedIn and Monster to import candidates. Oh, the capture tool? Yeah. Okay. What issue are you seeing? Well, whenever I pull up a new candidate, the capture icon does not pop up to capture them. Okay. So if you go to the top right of your browser and click on the little capture logo up there, does it open the capture menu or is it showing it like a strange error? So when you say capture, is that the extensions? Yeah, if you just click on the extension logo at the top right. Yeah, it doesn't show an error. Okay, no error. Okay, that's good at least. Let's see. Let's check to make sure you have the right version number. So if you click the three dots at the top right of your browser, look for extensions, manage extensions. Okay. And do you have Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge? The Google Chrome logo is like a circle with a blue dot in the middle and red, yellow, and green around it. Yeah, at the top left by extensions, it's the Google Chrome. Okay, good. So at the top right, it says developer mode. There's a little toggle. Make sure that's turned on. Hold on one second. Okay. Sorry about that. No problem. What were you saying? So at the top right, there's a toggle that says developer mode. Go ahead and switch that on if it's already. It is on. Awesome. So that will give us the version number of each one of your extensions. So if you go to PCR capture, what version number are you seeing next to that? Should be like a 1. Yeah, there you go. 1.2.1? Uh-huh. Okay, awesome. So that's the right one. And then also, yeah, go to your extension again at the top right, that little logo. Is it listing a list of websites or is it asking for the PCR URL? It's got Adobe, Cisco, PCR, and save email. Okay, yeah. So that's your list of extensions on this page. But if you go back up to the top right of your browser and click on that little PCR capture logo again, the extension, what do you see when it opens up? Is it a list of websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, CareerBuilder, or is it asking for a PCR URL? The problem is whenever I click on the PCR logo, it shows me just a narrow toolbar that I can't see everything. everything. Oh, okay, yeah, that's kind of the error one that people have been seeing. Okay, so if your computer kind of reacted that way to the newest update, we probably should just remove the tool and then reinstall it. I think that'll fix it. So if you're still looking at your list of extensions on the current page, there's a remove button under the PCR capture. Go ahead and click on that. Okay, hold on just a second. Okay, I'm going to remove it. Perfect. And then on the left of that page, it says discover more extensions and themes on the Chrome Web Store. You want to click on that. Okay. And then type in PCR capture in the search bar at the top and search for that. Okay. Got it. And then open up that first result there, the capture tool. And once you click on that, you should see add to Chrome at the top right. I do not see that. So what are you seeing on your screen currently? Oh, it popped up. Okay. Add to Chrome. Perfect. extension. Exactly, yep. And that will reinstall the tool and then we'll just get you signed into that tool again. So you should see it's like a white puzzle piece at the top right of the browser. If you hover over it, it does say the word extensions. If you click on that, it'll list all of your extensions and you can pin the PCR capture tool again up there. Okay, I'm looking for the area that you want me to hover over. So, yeah, it's top right, kind of where you were clicking on the PCR logo, the capture menu before, like a white puzzle piece directly next to that. Yeah. Click on that and make sure the PCR capture is pinned so that the capture logo is up and to the left of that puzzle piece. Okay. Got it. And when you click on that capture logo again, is it asking for a PCR URL? Let me get out of here. No. Okay. What do you see? Okay. When you click on it, what does it say? say just as PCR capture and then what's below that when I click on the PCR capture icon logo yeah what does it say when you click on that PCR capture oh now it's asking for the URL yes okay so that needs you to just open up PCR and a new tab you might already have that open and just copy that full web address and and paste it in there. Okay, I've copied the URL that you're saying open up a new window. So, yeah, are you looking at PCR right now, and then you copied that web address? I'm not looking at, you mean the PCR in general how to sign on? Yeah, that's the web address it needs so it can get to your account specifically when we sign in. Okay. Should I sign in now? You don't have to sign in. Just grab the web address up at the top. Okay, I've done that. Perfect. And then you can click on the PCR extension logo at the top right again so that it'll let you enter that or paste that web address into the field. And then hit log in and it'll ask you for your username, password and database. I've already got that built in there, so just sign right on in. Okay, so are you signing into PCR in general or to the capture tool at the top right, that little logo we keep opening? Into PCR in general. Okay, yeah, we want to open up that logo at the top right again, and when you hit log in after pasting your web address, that's when it asks you for your username, password, and database. So, when I clicked on the icon, it took me back to the URL screen. Does it have your URL already entered in there from when you pasted it last time? Let me log out real quick. No, it does not. So I can paste the URL again. And see, I'm in the actual PCR login. I'm not sure where you want me to be. Oh, so, yeah, we're trying to log into the Google Chrome extension, the capture tool, which is separate from your PCR website, we want to get logged back into that tool, which is at the top right of your browser. Okay. So if you just click on the PCR icon at the top right of your browser, it's to the left of the puzzle piece now that you've pinned it. Yeah. Okay. If you click on that, that's where you're entering in your web address, if you already haven't pasted it in there, and then you hit log in. You mean the URL that I copied? Yeah, the URL that you copied should be pasted into that capture tool. It is, but when I click log in, it doesn't do anything. There is a kind of a placeholder text that's there usually. It ends in the word my company. Is that what you're seeing? So that's not your web address. That's just a grayed-out text that you can type over top of. So you need to go back and copy your web address and paste your actual web address into that space. So I need to go back to my PCR login and then get that address. Exactly. Go there, copy it, and we're pasting it into the tool. Okay. That makes sense. Okay, I've copied our web address, but now when I click on the PCR icon, it's not allowing me to paste it in there. Are you, so when you put your cursor in there, you should be able to type over that grayed out web address, kind of the placeholder text? No, that's not allowing me. Okay, so it says my company at the end of that grayed out text? Yep. And if you click on it and just press any letter on your keyboard, does the grayed out text go away? No. Okay. We're going to have to jump on a screen share so I could see. Go ahead and in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And is it prompting you for a meeting ID? meetings.ringcentral.com. No, it's not. It just goes in the sign-in or join and host online meetings anywhere. Okay. So it redirected you to the homepage. Try that web address again, meetings, plural with an S, .ringcentral.com. That's what I did. No, it just brings up a different host of websites I can go to. Let me email you the link. Let me see if that works. Is your best email address tim at ednorice.com? Yep. Okay. Okay, let me send that to you. Okay, that's been sent and there should be a link you can just click on to join the meeting. Okay, my name is in there. Join meeting now. Perfect. Yep. All right. All right. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Are you getting any pop-ups or anything? We can't ask your access your microphone follow these steps. Does it give you an option to continue without audio? Are you in there now? Yeah, I'm in there now. Are you seeing the screen with both of our initials on it? Uh-huh. Okay, perfect. Perfect. Then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. And then click on like screen one to highlight it and select it and then hit share. Where is screen one at? Did you click on entire screen up towards the top? I did. Okay, and does it list, like, little boxes that look like your screen below that? Yeah. Oh, there we go. Okay, I can see that now. Perfect. All right, so at the top right of the browser, click on the capture icon. All right, and then click on where it says HTTP at the beginning of that and hit paste. You can right click on that to paste it or you can, there you go, and hit login. And then go ahead and enter your PCR username and password. Good luck with this one. Let's see. And then choose your database from that drop-down. Log in. Awesome. So you're logged in now. So we can go back and test this on LinkedIn. If you have a LinkedIn open or a different website open in another tab. What about Monster? Yeah, you could try that, whichever one you want to test it on. I don't think Monster is... Hold on. Let me go ahead and try LinkedIn first. Okay. Go ahead and hit refresh on this page now that we've installed the tool. Okay. So master is not an option in that area. How do we get that installed? If you click on that PCR capture logo again at the top right of the browser, the capture, if you scroll down, you'll see Monster listed there. Okay, there it is. Yep, so that's part of the tool. So you can go to Monster and test it out. Thank you. Perfect. Awesome. Anything else you were having trouble with? Oh, God, what was I going to ask you about? I just slipped my mind. well now I don't remember so I guess that's the case of the Friday morning blues yeah if you do think of it just call back in or you can email us at support at main sequence dot net and we will help you out okay we'll do thank you so much Garrett. Thanks. Have a great rest of your day. See you. Bye-bye. Bye.",
