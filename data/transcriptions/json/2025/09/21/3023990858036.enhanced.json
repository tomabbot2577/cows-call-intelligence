    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm calling because I wanted some help or some direction on how I can run. There's a couple of different statistics that we want to search for in our database or be able to run a report on. And I'm kind of wondering if we already have them, if they already exist or if they need to be built. or, you know, just, so I was just wanting to know if you could help with that. Sure. Let me jump into your database here. So let's see. Search console. Okay. All right. So what kind of a report were you looking to run? Well, so I'm imagining it's a position report. So basically you want to be able to run a report of all the candidates presented during a certain time period, let's say in the past year, that made it onto the first interview in the pipeline. Okay. Okay. First interview. Let's see. So if I go to pipeline reports, applicant tracking. OK. So we can do a report called an applicant tracking report that you can put a date range and then you can specifically point to certain steps in the pipeline. You can do the whatever step you named for when you present the candidate and then also to the first interview step. and once you generate that report you could kind of eliminate the names that only appear in the presented step kind of in the Excel file and you'll be left with people who have hit pull I think that'd be the best way to do it so go to reports in the main menu of PCR and then pipeline reports on the left and then applicant tracking report on the right. And this will give you the search params heading up at the top when that's expanded. It gives you a select interview date range kind of on the right there. That would be where you put in the date range there. And then the filters heading below it when that's expanded you can go to the one called filter by interview type slash status this would if you just click the little pop-out icon on the right ask you to choose which pipeline you're using so which set of steps it has a legacy by default but most likely you're using a different one like there's one here called biz dev one called default and then one called search oh yeah I think it's the I think it's a default that we're using okay that makes sense and then just check the box next to whichever ones you want to see in your report so it's probably going to be that sent to hiring manager and first in-person interview. And you can even check the second in-person interview if you want that included. And then hit select. And then I think the only other thing to look at is there's a filter on the right called filter by job status. That has A, comma, I in there by default. I would clear that out in case there's any positions that are filled or closed. you want those to show up too. So you could just leave the filter by job status empty. And I think that's all we would be looking at filter wise. What's the date range you were looking at again? I'll just run it on my end. Well, just my example. Yeah, we were just going to do like the last year. So I was just going to run one from like 7-1-2024 to today. Perfect. All right. And then once you fill in those filters at the top right, click the three horizontal lines, and you should have the option to – first off, you could just view it with the PDF view mode option. That'll just open it in a new tab. But most of the time, you'll want to export it to Excel or to a CSV file so that you can manipulate and rearrange the data. But I'll just do PDF view mode to make sure you're getting – Okay, so that says no records found. Let me see. Something's different there then. Let's try this. I'm going to try the other pipeline called search to see if that one brings back results. Okay. Let's try that. We really don't use the other ones, honestly. They're kind of experimental. Gotcha. Okay, so the search, that brought back a lot of pages, about 47 pages. So I think the default one is actually the one that you don't use when it comes to pipelines. I think you used the one called search. So you just want to adjust the interview type statuses to include the search pipeline. And then I selected the step called presentation, and then the three interview steps, client interview, second interview, third interview. and it brought back 47 pages in the PDF view mode, but you can always export it to Excel. Okay, so really quick, tell me again. So up in the search params, it's just the date range that I'm working with, right? Yeah. And the filters, I can check that box down there at the bottom left that says include only positions with interviews? So that would be, it's using the word interview kind of like the old way PCR used to use it. That means include only positions where people have hit a step. So any step in the pipeline is considered a quote unquote interview. Oh, okay. So then I can uncheck that? Yeah, it doesn't matter if that's checked or unchecked, I guess it would just, I guess it would eliminate any where nobody has hit an interview step, but since we did use the filter by interview type status, it's only going to be selecting people who have hit pipeline steps. So that one, I guess, wouldn't matter if it's checked or unchecked. Okay, and then the other filter that I'm using here is type of status so it's a filter by interview type status and then so I open that up and I'm going to include okay hold on legacy biz dev you said search works okay yeah search yeah and I did presentation for sure as one of them and then whichever interview you wanted to include if you want to include all of them or just one of them. Huh. So I would run probably one report with just presentation. I mean, I guess you're right. I mean, I can sort it in an Excel document, but I can also just run run one report. Now, would the person have left in presentation or would they just need to have hit or gone through presentation to be included in this report? It would be if they've hit presentation at any point, not where they stopped. So I could run a report presentation only and then get a number and then run another report and i'd have to i'd go in and make sure that i could trust it or that it you know produce the information that i would compare it but ideally i would like in theory i could just run a report with presentation only get a number and if the data matches um then i could run a different report or separate report which is client interview and then I could subtract basically if again if it truly does I'll have to kind of spot check it as far as it being accurate but that makes sense yeah yeah I think that's a great plan though just run it separately and then subtract alright so let me ask you and I appreciate that and I'm making notes so I don't have to And I'm wondering if I can do the same thing. Is there a report that we can run where we can see the clients, the companies that we've done the most work with? Just like an overall kind of company or like, I don't know if it's a company report or position. it probably would be a position report but it would I don't know I'm thinking position report because that's where we would really be okay yeah um you could do like a position report let's see what this filled position maybe there's like a filled position report um and then you can let me see if you could filter by no okay you can't filter by company oh yeah you can filter by company slash organization unit actually I'm not sure let me try something else here position reports So would you want to see filled positions or ones that are currently open? Would that be considered work with the company? Yeah, I would do all of it. Yeah. We would want to. Yeah. All right. So let's see if we have summary report. That's just, yeah, for some reason it's not letting me filter by company on that. That's interesting. I'm never contracting. Let me try some of these. yeah none of the company reports make sense I don't think the pipeline so I'm going back to position it's got to be something here in the position reports if you do a summary report I'm just going to see what that comes up with. I'll put in a date range, maybe since the beginning of the year. Okay. So, my company name. Okay. Okay, this is kind of interesting. So there's this report. It'll show you the position summary report, and you can sort it by company name, and it'll show you each position that you have. I'm wondering if these are just open positions. Let's see. Here, let me check to see if this is open. ID is 242. Position summary report. Okay, no, it's showing filled positions as well. That's good. Okay, so, yeah, the position summary report, And if you order it by company name when setting it, it'll show you all the positions that have been opened in the date range, whether they've been filled or are still open. And there's even a, as you scroll down, a couple charts and graphs. But then there's a breakdown that it'll show a list of the company names and then the count of positions that you had open with them. So Trinity Park Conservancy had two positions open since the beginning of the year where Forefront Living had one. And you can see those all back to back, if that would be helpful. So that would be reports and then position summary report. And then do I and then sort by company name? Yeah, I would put in a date range and then sort by company name. okay so like let's say I just wanted to do the last five years I probably want to do from the beginning of time just to I don't know what my name is just 2000 and then okay and then export excel and you know what I didn't try and excel let's see if I'm going to see if that's any different than the pdf view mode sometimes it doesn't I just like the excel I like being able just to manipulate it you know once yeah oh I see so yeah if you do open the excel there are tabs across the bottom where you could say totals by company and that'll give you the count of positions that were opened or even ones that were filled next to each company. And then there's one that's called other. That's interesting. Oh, yeah, I'm not sure. Let me see. Other. Oh, and then below that, it says other breakdown. Like that's like half. Yeah, I wonder why those were considered. Exactly 50 percent. So I'm wondering if everything here is categorized under other as well for some reason. That's strange. 50%. It could be... It just had hit too many... It had like 30 rows or something and then it had too many to calculate into the pie chart below. So it might have just grouped some together as other. Yeah, that's really strange. I wonder why it was considered other. Either way, though, the other is broken down. It does give me the answer that I'm looking for. Okay. All right. So this one is position summary report. I'll make this note. Let's see. I think I have already. I'll have to call you back because I don't know. I won't make you go through this, right? Because I think I already have a custom report for that percentage of people, like for tenure. Oh, what about what percentage of offers are accepted? So it's rare that we have any candidates that reject an offer. But in the event that they do, I know that we've taken, you know, we've made note that the candidate declined. Right. And so would that be a pipeline report? And just, you know, in picking the I'm wondering if it would be a picking that decline. Yeah, let's see. I hope it would include those in option. Yeah. OK. So they have the out of process steps. So offer decline is one of those. Absolutely. So you could use that applicant tracking report under pipeline reports. to use it the same way. Oh the same way that I did with presentation and client interview I would just pick. Exactly and then you just remember to clear out that job status from the A comma I so that it can include even filled positions and then yeah use the interview type slash status filter to go to your search Search pipeline and choose offer decline is listed there. Perfect. Okay. That works. And then the 10 year one, again, I think I'm going to, I'll look into this. I think I had, I think Robin helped me a while back. She created some like just on the fly. It was crazy. She's really good at those. Yeah. Like it's like her, it's like, yeah, She's like very passionate about it. And I really appreciate that. Oh my gosh, this is magic. But she created some reports for me and they are kind of all, like it has all the data in them, but I think I can sort it and play with it a little bit to help with tenure because we, should we include a date and stuff? You know, just different statistical reports about, you know, how long the search lasted and things like that. Gotcha. But I will, I'll give you a call back. Can you give me your name again? Garrett? Yeah, my name is Garrett. Exactly. Yep. Okay. All right. Garrett, you've been super helpful this morning. I really appreciate it. Happy to help. I forgot that I need information right before a call that I had this morning. So you were also very quick and to the point. So I really appreciate that. And I'll give you a call back if I need help with the 10-year report. Perfect. That sounds good. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Garrett. You have a good day. You too. Bye.",
