    "text": " Thank you for calling Mean Seeking Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Hey, Jason. This is Kristen Elfman. I work with EHS Recruiting Company, and I use the Outlook portal, and it's not working. It said the extension was no longer supported by Chrome, so I reloaded an extension, but I still can't get it to work, so I'm hoping you can help me. The Outlook portal or the PCR capture tool? I don't know. So the way I do it is I do everything through Outlook, and I split my screen, and I've got PCR on my toolbar, and I don't have it there anymore. Okay. Let's get on a screen share so we can take a look. Yeah. Do you use RingCentral? I can. I don't know what that is. Okay. Go to meetings.ringcentral.com in your browser. Okay. Hold on a second. Meetings. Oh, there we go. RingCentral. Okay. RingCentral. You said meetings.ringcentral.com? Yes. Okay. All right. All right. Is it asking for like a meeting ID? No. Maybe I'm not. RingCentral Cloud Communication. That's not right. All right. Meetings.RingCentral. OpenMeetings.Tech. I'm just Googling it. RingCentral.com. The website should be meetings.ringcentral.com. All right. Now I got it. Yeah, there's a bunch of them. Okay, I got it. Okay. Yeah, now it's looking for an ID. It is 936-935-457. Okay. Join. Join. And my name. Okay, join meeting now. Okay, so there's going to be a blue share button down at the bottom. Go ahead and click on that and then select an option for entire screen. Let's see, it says continue without audio, join with audio by computer. Continue without audio. Okay, and then share button, got it. And you're going to want to share your entire screen. entire screen okay I hit okay got it sorry I'm a little slow today okay so show me what's going on okay so this is my normally when I hit like normally I've got PCR up here on my toolbar PC recruiter and then I can you know I can split my screen and have PC recruiter right here you know and have my, you know, have... Oh, can you drag Outlook over to your other screen? You're sharing... Oh, yeah. You must be sharing your other screen. Oh, sorry. So here... So normally I've got it up, you know, PC Recruiters on my toolbar. Mm-hmm. Okay. Down in your search bar in the system tray, the very bottom, can you type in the word classic? Oh, I don't know what that did. C-L-A-S-S-I-C. Am I putting it right? Yeah, you're good. Try Outlook, like clear out classic, and then just type in Outlook. And hit enter? Yeah, I believe that's when we have open, so we might just need to install the portal. Okay, go ahead and go back to your browser. We're going to install the Outlook portal. It looks like it's not on here for some reason. Okay. Actually, I'm sorry. Let's start here. In your Outlook window, go to the top left corner and go to File. Yep. And then Options at the bottom. and go to add-ins. And we're at the bottom where it says manage, change com add-ins to disabled and hit go. Okay, go ahead and click on that and hit enable. click on that item okay and then hit close okay and hit okay in the bottom right and we're going to close outlook and reopen it okay well I've got to open make sure that it let me just make sure that it's actually closing sometimes it takes forever the task manager yeah shut it down make sure it's shut down yeah okay okay and you want me to reopen it yep okay Oh, there it looks like it might have worked. Yay. Ah, what happened? Sometimes it can get disabled. It just happens. Okay. Like it can just kind of get knocked offline. If that happens, just call us and we can turn it back on. But usually what happens when, yeah. But if you, handy to remember what we just did, but if you don't remember that, just give us a call and we'll get that turned back on for you. You're great. I really appreciate it. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, you have a good day. All right. You too, Jason. Take care. You too. Bye.",
