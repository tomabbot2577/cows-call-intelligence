    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. It's Connie Rose again with Alexander Raymond. I'm on Connected Services. Yeah. What's going on? A couple questions. But the first one is I'm running across, I'm doing a cleanup of a roll-up, right? And I'm running across some of my data that's been transferred over. I do mark them if I'm not going to use them as either retired or a recruiter not interested for various reasons. If I want to delete them out of the system, I cannot figure out how that is done or do I have that permission to do that. Let me take a look here. I could definitely move them out of my roll-up. Let me take a look here. I mean that would be a real extreme case. Even people I don't want to use, I put retired or the reason why I don't want to use them. So if anybody comes in. We don't have permission to delete records from the database. That's what I thought. You just confirmed that. Thank you so much. Yep. Let me see. Okay. The other question I have is I'm in the middle of learning how to do sequencing. I've already created my letter, right? And I have my parameters, day one, day four, day, you know, whatever. So I've got that far. But here is what happened on training last Friday. We were training, and one recruiter sent an email to another recruiter, you know, basically acting like they were the recruiter sending it to a client, and immediately went into spam. So I looked it up on AI, and I discovered that, you know, it was quite disturbing, you know, to the team when that happened. But I looked it up and I read the information that if there's links in the email, if there's too much bolding, there was something else I can't remember that whatever Outlook, whether it's Gmail or Outlook or whatever, will tag it as spam and put it in a spam folder. Knowing that that is correct, how can we be sure, I guess, without checking every single email in spam? Because, I mean, I'm bad about not even going into spam. Is there anything on your end or anything on our end that we can do? Now, I'm going to go in and I'm going to create a second signature for myself inside the company. One signature will be, you know, with a do you want our newsletter and this link and that link. We've got like four links underneath our name. That's everybody's signature, right? Yeah. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a secondary signature. Well, you can only have one signature in the system. I mean through I got what you're saying I can put a couple signatures in Gmail but I'm not really using Gmail I'm using the email within the system when I'm doing sequencing, correct? Correct Okay So We always recommend the opt-out links in your emails as well that can help with spam otherwise you'll want to contact your email host and they can usually tell you if you're on any blacklists and help with that. Yeah, I doubt that's the case. I doubt that's the case. And this is called a bounce step off of you, what I can do. And so what I'm going to do is when I talk to the owner sometime today, I usually talk to him once a day, I'm going to write, and I know I don't want to remove links, but I think in sequencing we're going to have to. because it's throwing it we tried it two or three times it's definitely throwing it into spam so that's an internal thing that we'll have to deal with what else I think that's about it you answered the question about deleting anything and then you answer the question about not having two emails inside PCR yeah like I said putting the opt-out links in your emails as well will help with deliverability. If you're going straight to spam, even if there are links, you're usually on some sort of blacklist email-wise. Otherwise, you wouldn't be going into spam. So you may want to reach out to your mail host about that as well. right yes for me I mean some recruiters they like prospect right and so they're sending bulk emails or they're sending emails to people that haven't even spoken to me I'm not going to mean that some people do that I don't do that I do not do that I don't spend my time sending emails to people in the system that don't even know who I am. Because I know I'm not going to get a reply. They're going to delete me or jump me or report me. I am aware of that. And just like with emails too, like if there are other people in the organization that have been sending out to people that they don't know and they're marketing them as spam, the reason it could be going to spam is because you've had enough people market as spam and that affects the entire domain, not just a specific email address. Okay. That's good to know. Very good to know. Well, you've helped tremendously. Appreciate you. If I need you again, I'll recap. Sounds good. You have a great day. You too. Bye-bye.",
