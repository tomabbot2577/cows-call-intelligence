    "text": " McGuire Orthodontics, this is Caitlin. Hey Caitlin, I wanted to give a call and see about getting my daughter Ellie in for an appointment. Okay, so she would be a new patient with us? Yes, and I think her something is in that we were waiting for. The name is Ellen Lombardo. Oh, gotcha. Let's see. I believe I did leave a voicemail, so let me pull all that up. I think you did. We just hadn't returned the call yet. That's okay. Okay, so I have it here. Let's see see what I can do here. Just looking. Sorry, I'm just trying to see what we're considering next week if I can. Yeah, well, that would be perfect because the week of the 28th we're out of town. So we were hoping some point next week if possible. Let's see. Let's do, if you can, 2.30 on Monday, July 21st. That should work fine. Let me just make sure I don't have something else going on at that point already. You know what? Let's do 2.30 on Monday, the 21st. Yes. Perfect. All right. Do we need to bring anything? I think we're already paid the first half and the payments are coming through on the second half. So that's all done. Do we need to know anything? You guys are all set. groovy and if it's worth taking a note I also have a question for dr.
