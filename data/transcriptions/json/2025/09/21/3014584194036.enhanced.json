    "text": " relationship with Lenar for over 20 years. Hello? Five years ago, they actually penned a paper and made their relationship. Thank you for holding this. This is Robin. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. Hi, Robin. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Thank you. I'm just calling in from the Newport group, and I have a question. so one of our recruiters Brian he his email got disconnected from PCR and then we just connected it but I just want to make sure that I did it correctly and if it will repopulate emails that he sent out and received from when it was disconnected was it like the alias was not connected I think so so when we I just checked it today and at first it said when you put in test connection it was unsuccessful and then we just sign in with Microsoft and tested again and it's it says successful now but yeah there's any additional steps well you might have if it was sending an email those would not have gone through because the mail server would have rejected it now for incoming that's actually authenticated in another place. Okay. So let me see. Pull that one back in here. And I'm sorry, what was your name again? Giselle, G-E-S-S-E-L. So it was with Newport? Yes, the Newport group. So that's kind of how our relationship developed. We started recruiting for them out here, on positions out here. And then because we did a good job, we placed a few people. In fact, the vice president of acquisition, who is one of the decision makers on this position, is a gentleman named – Can you spell your name again for me again? J-E. Oh, I wouldn't have an account with PCR. I use the admin one, but I can give you the username of the recruiter. What is your name? Because I'm trying to even just pull up your information here. Oh, okay, yeah. It's J-E-S-S-E-L. Last name is Paredes. Gotcha. P-A-R-E-D-E-S. I didn't know I was spelling it. I don't know what I did. Okay. What is the database that the user logs into? The Newport Group, one word. The Newport Group, one word. Okay. And what is the username? B-H-A-R-M-E-N. H-A-R-M-O-N. I'm sorry, what was that again? H-A-R-M-O-N. Yes, that's correct. That's kind of how we got to working on this. As I mentioned, this is with Lennar. They developed the land. The land is used for remote master plan communities. It's not set up for incoming. So it would only be sending. Oh, okay. How do we set up the incoming? Hold on a second. Let's see. So sending from PCR, if that's where you had the email alias issue, that is corrected because he did do the sign-in with Microsoft. Okay. Is he trying to do like a mail campaign or something? I'm not sure what that is but he has the the PCR for Outlook add-on thing and yeah. Now that one what did what did you see there? What was it saying like that that the password into the app wasn't working or because that could be something different or did you only email alias list. I only did the email alias list. Okay so that's what the problem with that means is if you if he was sending an email from or she and he was to the person yes right okay if they were trying to email directly from PC recruiter nothing would have sent because they couldn't connect to the mail server. Okay. Which wouldn't really have anything to do with your Outlook portal add-in because that's really just kind of doing the activity syncs and stuff like that yeah so anything that he tried or she tried to send from pcr directly would not have sent because of that error before gotcha i think he's just been sending uh emails through his regular outlook Yeah, that's how he usually does it. Let me see if the person has any activities, just to make sure. Okay. Okay, so if I go activities, I'll go to the beginning of July. So anything written by the portal either writes as email or email received. Okay. So when. Or received. Okay. So users B, Harmon. Let me see when they got their last activity. Seven, nine. Yeah. That's as far as it recorded. Okay. Are you at that computer right now? Yes. Okay. Can we. Do you have RingCentral by any chance? Yes, I do. Okay. So if you're at that computer, open up the Ring Central app. Okay. And then go to video and then select join. Okay. Sorry, I'm seeing the computer is a bit slow. Okay. A join. Yep. Okay. I'm going to ask you for a meeting ID. Yes. Ready. It's 050. 394-810. And you don't need to join with audio or camera because we're already on the phone and we're going to be watching the screen, not the camera. Perfect. Okay. Okay. So it looks like you're in or getting in. Okay. I'm on. Okay. At the bottom of the screen, select share. I'm asking for kind of a range. But make sure you go over to entire screen. Other things. Income, maybe, you know, what's the bonus, you know, information like, and then the healthcare and. Loading. Parts to a base salary. I'm only interested in base salary ranges right now to get a feel for where you need to be. Can you give me an idea as far as a salary range, what you'd be looking for? All right. I'm sorry? Could you see me? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. So got it. Okay. So let's go over to his Outlook. So he should be able to send an email directly from PCR now, but let's look at the Outlook. Oh, okay. Let me... That's on the other screen. Let me just quickly change it. Always make sure to join the entire screen. Yeah, he has two screens. It says your entire screen and then screen one, screen two. Yeah, and each one of those has like a little preview. So you got to kind of see like what one are you wanting to show me? Okay. And then select share. I think it's sharing now. Yeah. Okay, let's go down to his outlook. speak but again he'll you know you don't want to speak it's sharing now yeah let's go down to his outlook information that may you know that you don't get typically from okay he got peace to recruiter um but so he doesn't have the reading pane enabled um so he wouldn't see anything like directly in there he's just in the email list but can you do me a favor and go to options up at the top so we're going to be way over to the right green wrench icon okay let's hit test connection okay that's good save and close and then let's see over to the right actually see where it's got like that down arrow I think that's the option. Oh, yeah, go to classic ribbon for me for a moment. Yeah, so I just want to let you know nothing about you get to see more. Okay, activity queue is zero. Okay. Any of these emails today? Are they somebody that would be in the database? Yeah, so we just sent one to Jennifer Drake, and we just checked in it saying that there's no emails that was sent and now yeah we just did that today just then okay I'm gonna ask for remote control yep let me get you yeah not a problem let me get you over this information on your resume in the next day and then I'll email I'll be looking for you to reach out to me and okay let me just make sure here you're coming back on the 25th so would it be safe to say do you want that call to take place on the 25th or the 20 the 28th okay right I figured okay all right well we'll just reconnect Okay. 10spin01 at gmail.com. Activities. Let's see. 79. We have to go back a little bit. I do see an email recorded. 79 at 947 a.m. Old-fashioned. 947. Then at 421 p.m. when you get back from Europe, okay? Let's see. Email. Great. Thanks, Frankie. Take care. Bye-bye. 947. Okay. So this was an email. Okay. That was email received. Okay. Right? Yes. Yeah. And then we sent one today at 1059 a.m. 7-9 at 944 Hyperion Friday is perfect for me okay let me see something here because usually what happens is like the activity queue All right. Nope, sorry, I want to take that out. Just want to minimize. What's the last activity that we have? Yeah, we try and press something and nothing would pop up. Yeah, he has his reading paint off. Okay. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Okay, so let's go back. Let's see, like, when the last activity date was that we got something. 7-1. 7-1. Kind of surprised I don't see anything in the filters. Email received. 7-9. Okay. So Thursday. Let's go back to 7-8. Okay. So let's try log out. Log in. No. And still nothing with the activity queue. Okay. Where do you see that? Oh, I love the activity queue. Because, like, if you were, like, not connected for a little bit. Let me just check this real quick. Okay. If you were not connected for a little bit. Like, let's say you had, like, a wrong password for an extended period of time. You didn't really lose the activity. They get queued off right over here. Okay. Sometimes when you reconnect, you'll see where it's like climbing and dropping as it's trying to find and write those activities. For some reason, this didn't do it. So I'm going to have to do a little different thing here. Okay, let me just get a screen because I'm always like forgetting the exact format here. Okay. I'm just going to screenshot that. Because once you start typing, you lose them. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay. So I'm going to go 2025-07-08. Mm-hmm. Space, and we'll do like 01, 01, 01. Actually, 1 o'clock in the morning, I believe. Okay. Okay. We're going to try reprocessing these. Does reprocessing bring back those emails that were missed? Basically, what it should do is look for all those emails that are in here since that date and try to write activities for them. Gotcha. Okay, so then we got to go file, go to exit. Oh, we're going to have to close. Is that fine? Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, you can get rid of that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Did it close completely? There, now you can get it back. So should he just keep the reading pane on at all times? Well, it is helpful. Like if you want to jump to a name record or do something inside PCR, you still have the right-click features. So without having that reading pane, like you can't go to like a PCR screen in your Outlook. Oh, gotcha. they've announced a corporate hiring freeze. He will not be able to do anything until mid-August. Oh, I think I know why. I'm not doing anything. He's on the line. If he can hold, that would be great. Let's go file. We had the Opscom call, and they said, yeah, corporate hiring freeze. He goes, this isn't even an addition. This is a replacement. Oh, he just had that. Why is this so closed then? He goes, so there's a chance we get sooner. He goes, but it's... It's probably because he has a few tabs open. I took my other search, too. Well, luckily... he'll be around for it. Let me just jump off. Let me just jump off. Okay. See how it's starting to find him now. Nice. Okay, cool. Okay. So, and that could be why it's a little slow right now. It's trying to find those activities that it couldn't write before. So, this number is probably going to climb and also drop at the same time. Okay. You might see it go 21, 18, 24. Like it's doing basically two actions, finding and writing at the same time. Okay, gotcha. And that's like adding it to PCR activity. Yeah, it's trying to find the activities it couldn't write, but also write them. So once this gets down to zero pretty steadily, then you know it's caught up. Okay, perfect. Once it sits there for about 30, 40 seconds, then you know, okay, it's kind of caught up. But let's just make sure here. Okay, thank you. So if this happens again, do I just do what we did earlier? I usually tell people don't do that unless we're on with you. Okay. It may be something else to check out first instead. That's really the issue. Right. Okay. Will do. So now it's just grabbing all the activities that you missed. I'm going to guess I pretty much found them now that it's just dropping. It's going down. It's just adding it now. And then once this is all done. Yeah, once it's done, it'll check that record. And that activity should be there. Okay, perfect. And I, because I was running the daily activity report on PCR for everyone. Will that show up, say, for like Friday last week? Yeah, because those activities should have had the date that it was created. Not like, well, it was based on when the email was sent and received. So it really shouldn't matter when it wrote. Okay. Why is this here? Probably had to restart. Why is that acting so weird there? Let me just go to a different name. And I'm jumping over my email view. Or what is this? Is that just another window that just happens to be? I don't think so. I don't know. Yeah, let's. Oh, I don't know what that is. Yeah. Oh, what is that? I think it's frozen. Oh, now it's gone. I think it was in the Outlook. Let's see what happens now. I don't know if you needed any of those meetings. That's fine. You can just find it later on. Yeah, that should be fine. All right, so we're good there. Wait, I see activities now. Now if it goes to activities. Mm-hmm. Yeah. 274-1734. And the office pretty much every day until 5. Hey, awesome. There it is. I see it. Well, no, it should be from 7-9. But you got some other ones, too. Okay. Let's make sure that 7-9 one is here. That was the one we were looking for, right? Yeah. 7-9. Okay. It should be in there. Awesome. Thank you so much. All right. So if that happens with others, then it would just be best to give you guys a call. Because it does happen, like, not really all the time, but it does happen often for, like, other recruiters as well. But what I would usually do. Yeah, here's the first thing I would recommend doing is looking, are they logged in? Okay. Because sometimes people, like, it's kind of disconnected. Like, maybe it timed out, especially on a Monday. You know, people leave it open up over the weekend. I always tell people it's always best to file, exit, close your Outlook, and make sure you're restarting it each morning so that way you're reestablishing that connection. Okay. Yeah. And then you could also look here because it might just be close Outlook, like log back in or just use this log out, log in. That's the first troubleshooting. Very, very, very seldom do I ever have to do that reprocess. That's usually the first portion. awesome I will do that and then the other thing too is when you do go to options if somebody's getting like a password or server error make sure they're on version 530 so if somebody's had pgr portal for a really long time if they've never upgraded it to 530 they might be running into some other issues but they've been like going on for months because they need to be on 530 it just means that they have one of pretty old version that doesn't know how to connect to the server right anymore. Okay. Yeah, but this is why I kind of like doing this classic ribbon because you see this as well as that to help keep an eye on it. Yeah, I think we'll keep it as that. And then if he clicks on any email, like how does that pop up on the reading pane? So here your reading pane, you've got PCR portal and email. So if you go to an email, it'll flip it over to viewing the email. Okay. Now, if he wants to go back to what he was doing, you just kind of, you don't have to research the name, just flip it back to where you were. Okay. Awesome. Perfect. Sounds good. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Have a great week. Thank you. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
