There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning. This is Jim. Robin Montoni is the best, best person here. guaranteed no matter what anybody says she's the best Thank you. Oh, hi, Robin. Thanks. How are you? Not so bad. And you? Oh, pretty good. I'm just waiting on John. In this spreadsheet, John, I'm just waiting on John. with the customers. He wants me to say like who's paid, you know. Oh, yeah. Oh, did Bill send that to you? Yeah. I'm in the Google Doc right now. I'm going through it. Groovy. I'm glad because he just told me he needed it to get paid for it from last month. I'm already two weeks late on Monday. He's like, oh, we need to look at that. I'm like, well, let me get it to you. And I'm going to bet you won't find anything wrong or not on there. But if you do, just reply back to Bill with me. Yes, it's the sales receipts ones that are a bigger problem for the other project. And then they did an invoice 619. I'm putting when they pay their install invoice, if they have auto pay enabled, when they paid their last monthly and when their next monthly is due. Oh, cool. Cool, cool. Is that good? You have access to that contract sent Google Doc I shared, don't you? That shows the date they paid their invoice, if it helps at all. I'm just going in and undoing it on this one spreadsheet. No worries. No worries. Auto-pay is now enabled. Yes. Why is this so freaking slow? I think my internet's bad down here today. Were you in the basement? Yes, I am. Oh, are you always in the basement? Nope. I'm in the basement right now because Michael needed a better office look because he actually does Zooms and he didn't want his bedroom showing. Oh, yeah, because he's doing the insurance, isn't he? yeah and they do a lot of zoom so we switched i mean he's out of town right now he's with my nephew in chicago but we switched for now but yeah it seems like it's a little a lot of times i'm not really noticing it today i am though that's good is he doing good still um there's good days there's bad days you know it fails oh yeah for sure for sure and michael's a very reactionary person. Is that the word I'm looking for? And so when it's a good day, he's on top of the moon. And then if he has a bad day, then it's the opposite. That's a bummer. Got to get used to the good and the bad. Yeah. I'm like, that's how it is, you know. And those good days may make up for several bad days. For sure. It's just like his cousin, high expectations, and he wants to take him under his wing. It's always like a big disappointment, it feels like. They're in Chicago right now. Emily Simpson is getting real. I was trying to look at the pictures. they've gone over pizza they play basketball he's had them up at five in the morning going get up get up we're going running he's like i'm gonna go crazy just for fun or are they doing something business related he's having him work there and just helping him because you got to take a test so you get licensed i guess or something so he's helping him prep for that i think he's gonna be taking his test while there i'm i'm not really sure i don't even know i'll be in chicago and it's either going to be there or his house in puerto rico so Chicago's closer and it being Chicago yeah I think I'm gonna have to call John see what he's doing maybe he forgot us and I know he was only back from vacation yesterday let me give him a call I'm gonna drop out and then call him and drop right back in okay actually I might even try and put this call on hold and call him so I can not have to dial back in how do you put someone on hold oh here it is okay I'll be right back in the put on hold wait Robin you still Henry mm-hmm I don't know how this thing works I'm I'm going to try it this way. Here we go. Robin? Yeah, he's not there. I left no voicemail. I told him we'd get back and reschedule. But I couldn't get him. Okay, I'll drop another email to he and you. Moving on to our stuff then. Okay. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye. Goodbye.",

other project.\n\n34\n00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:16,772\nAnd then they did an invoice 619.\n\n35\n00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,345\nI'm putting when they pay their install invoice,\n\n36\n00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:24,367\nif they have auto pay enabled,\n\n37\n00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:27,274\nwhen they paid their last monthly and when their next monthly is due.\n\n38\n00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,084\nOh,

one spreadsheet.\n\n44\n00:03:45,054 --> 00:03:45,280\nNo worries.\n\n45\n00:03:45,441 --> 00:03:45,792\nNo worries.\n\n46\n00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,058\nAuto-pay is now enabled.\n\n47\n00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:48,960\nYes.\n\n48\n00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:58,249\nWhy is this so freaking slow?\n\n49\n00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,700\nI think my internet's bad down here today.\n\n50\n00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,520\nWere you in the basement?\n\n51\n00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,580\nYes, I am.\n\n52\n00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,000\nOh, are you always in the basement?\n\n53\n00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,400\nNope.\n\n54\n00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,584\nI'm in the basement right now because Michael needed a better office look because\n\n55\n00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:21,280\nhe actually does Zooms and he didn't want his bedroom showing.\n\n56\n00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,880\nOh, yeah, because he's doing the insurance, isn't he?\n\n57\n00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:32,085\nyeah and they do a lot of zoom so we switched i mean he's out of town right now\n\n58\n00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:37,798\nhe's with my nephew in chicago but we switched for now but yeah it seems like it's\n\n59\n00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:43,847\na little a lot of times i'm not really noticing it today i am though that's good is\n\n60\n00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:49,560\nhe doing good still um there's good days there's bad days you know it fails oh yeah\n\n61\n00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,920\nfor sure for sure and michael's a very reactionary person.\n\n62\n00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140\nIs that the word I'm looking for?\n\n63\n00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,760\nAnd so when it's a good day, he's on top of the moon.\n\n64\n00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,980\nAnd then if he has a bad day, then it's the opposite.\n\n65\n00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,460\nThat's a bummer.\n\n66\n00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,240\nGot to get used to the good and the bad.\n\n67\n00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,100\nYeah.\n\n68\n00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,880\nI'm like, that's how it is, you know.\n\n69\n00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,220\nAnd those good days may make up for several bad days.\n\n70\n00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,600\nFor sure.\n\n71\n00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,54",
