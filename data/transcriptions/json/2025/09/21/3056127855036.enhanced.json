    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Just I can't find your guys' status page like I used to, but I'm assuming you guys are working on being down. Is that something you guys are aware of? No, we haven't had any reports of being down at the moment. So we've been down for, gosh, about 29 minutes, and we've got people in Arizona, California, Michigan, and everyone's down regardless of their place. Let me pop in and take a look. What company are you with so I can take a look here? Automotive Personnel Network. Yeah, I'm able to get to your guys' page and log in no problem on my end. I can get to the login page, but when you click login, it just spins. It can't do anything. And then all the what's new doesn't load. The system status doesn't load. are you guys using like a shared network or like a VPN well no actually no we have a shared drive that works on a VPN but it doesn't affect internet traffic it's just for two shared folders that sit on a drive at the other office but the person that's in California doesn't even have that so now which databases are they logging into or trying to log into the automated of personnel network? Yeah, it looks like the person that does automotive works fine. It's the healthcare that's having the trouble. Gotcha. Let me pop in and take a look there. Of course, it just finally logged me in after 30 minutes, but it's really slow. What's your username for that database? Nick M. Yeah, it's letting me write in. Well, now I just got... I've been messing around with this for 30 minutes and couldn't get anything to load, and now... Oop, so now I just went to add activity on a single person, and I've never seen this before. Huge error symbol. Oop, something went wrong. Red X, red error. And let's hop on a screen share so I can take a look here. Great. I'll try a few different things. What's a good email address for you? NickNick at APNUSA.com. All right. Just sent that on over to you. Okay. There we go. You don't happen to have, like, a third-party security company, do you? Or, like, IP that updates network securities? Well, we went through – so some security update happened on our cable modems from Cox two weeks ago. And two weeks ago, because we have that shared folder system that sits at the other office on a NAS drive, he had to come in and just update the information that goes between the two routers. But once again, it doesn't work for Internet traffic. It's only for two drives that are on our file folder. And it was two weeks ago. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure there was another some kind of like network security. Not that I know of. That doesn't mean that something else didn't happen. So at the bottom of the meeting window, you'll see a blue box with an arrow in it that says share. You'll want to share the entire screen. Got that, and this is what I'm looking at for the error. All right, go ahead and click the X for me. Okay. Then go ahead and just refresh this page. Man, it's funny. I'm giving you the... There we go. Well, this is the first time that it's actually that green status bar at the top has gone all the way to the right. Usually it's been stopping like here and then just sitting forever. So maybe it's resolving itself. It still does appear to be pretty darn slow, though. Let's open her up again. Yeah, it does look like it's moving slow. Yes, it looks, too. you said you have i'm assuming you have different internet providers for the different offices no they're the same internet provider but like everything is really fast you know i mean it's not it's just pcr which is the interesting part but they're both on cox but they are different accounts if that makes sense well cox is experiencing issues right now okay i just checked, there's a site called Down Detector. Okay. And they are having more than usual reports of internet issues. So if you scroll down... Oh, yeah. It's just weird because not a single other thing is slow on any website. So... Well, that one was loading a little bit slow. If you notice the... Yeah. Not all the banners are loading. Yeah, I guess you're kind of I guess you're right a little bit Okay, all right. Well, we'll just talk it up. But either way I just wanted to double check and make sure we weren't doing something that we needed to do. Yeah, and you have to Best way I can always describe it with internet connections is you got to think of this a highway so you have two lanes going and the right lane Completely fine get into some sites completely normal. Left lane, something's causing it to get backed up, and that can cause an issue just for certain sites. If you're able to, I would suggest probably restarting the modem in the office. That can usually help. Or even given toxicology, you can usually restart it manually on their end. Okay, perfect. Well, thank you so much. Like I said, I just wanted to make sure whatever it was that we were doing, whatever needed to be done. So I appreciate your help. I'm more than happy to. If you need anything else, just let us know. Sounds good. Bye. Bye.",
