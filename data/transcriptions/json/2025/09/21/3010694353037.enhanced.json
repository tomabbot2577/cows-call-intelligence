    "text": " Thank you for calling DisruptX Talent. Press 1 if you are calling for Matt next. Press 2 if you are calling for Adrian Kemper. Your call has been forwarded to the voicemail for Adrian Kemper. No one is available to take your call. At the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording, you may hang up or press the pound key for more options. hi adrian this is robin montoni with main sequence um if you can give me a call back about your invoice i we did make the change um for two users and unfortunately i think when our bookkeeping consultant went in and was like verifying like any credits or taxes or anything like that i think some of those user changes got overwritten so i could either refund the difference or just take off a user for your next invoice and then the invoice after that will be back at two. Let me know how you prefer to do it. If you want to just adjust the next invoice for one user, that's something I can very easily do. But if I have to do a refund, I have to go through a different process. So let me know. My number is 440-946-5214 and I'm at extension 5466 and I'm really sorry that this happened but we will get it corrected for you whichever way you prefer thank you",
