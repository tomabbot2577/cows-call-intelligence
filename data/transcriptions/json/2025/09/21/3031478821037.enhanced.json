    "text": " This call is being recorded. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hello, this is Robin at Main Sequence. We received a call from someone named Karen. Yep, I was actually on the line earlier vaping. Yeah, thank you so much for calling and getting me back. I actually need help with the sequence that I'm currently creating, and I really don't know what is the error. Okay. What is your last name and your company? Oh, yeah. So my company name is Targeted Recruiting Group. My last name is Karen Camu, sorry, C-A-M-U. That's my last name. Okay. And what is your PCR username? Karen and then T-A-M-U. And what is the sequence that you're working on? Is it already created or are you working on the template? It's a template. But later I have questions with the sequence that I currently have. So the name of the template that I'm creating is bd-25mkt sequence. Now, when I'm checking for problems, it gives me an error that says, error, step send email in branch one has only the condition to opt out and subscribe without any other validating conditions. Yeah there's a couple things I'm seeing wrong. Let's first okay when you go to templates and where it says BD-25 market sequence click on that and select edit template name. Okay so one thing that you're going to need is under your rate limiter where you're going to have to pick who's sending it and then their email alias. That's the best one thing this does not have yet. Okay, I'll give me one second. Let me just go back here. So for the rate limiter, if I got it right, I use it because I want only 99 emails will be sent out per day and I'm on the right track with that. Yeah, well depending on who your mail server is, 99 might even get you past hitting some per hour restriction you never know with the mail servers I would maybe just kind of maybe just do like 10 per hour or 20 per hour just only have it run certain times though it kind of just depends I see so just in that hour would be fine okay hold on I'm still waiting for it to give me that option so you'd really just prefer to do it just for hour rather than yeah that's probably safer because if you hit where it's too many for the hour or even like i mean if you have like a delay they might have some space it out like if you just want to do like 10 per hour you know you do something like that okay that way you don't hit any restrictions with that especially because but it looks like you have Office 365, and you also have a SendGrid. Yeah. So which one would you be using? So I'm sending it through SendGrid. Okay. Then your 99 per day is fine. Okay. And then, sorry, what should I use here? Like email user? I could put email user here? You have to pick who the user is and then their email alias. So that would be like your Office 365 or your SendGrid. So I have a question here because I'm just doing this sequence for Todd. So is it safe to say that... So then you'd probably put his... Yeah, I would pick his username then. Okay. And then his email is... Okay. Got it. I didn't see this. Because if you... I'm not using rate limiter. It's not asking if you use this bulk email. So this is the... I'm not using this bulk email. I'm not using rate limiter it's not asking if you use this bulk email so this is going to be a setup when you are using this rate limiter well you got to pick it there to define what the pace is but then in the step itself you have to have one there too okay so let me go ahead and save this And still loading. Who are you naming? Robin. Robin, okay. Give me one second. Robin. Uh, still loading. I think still need to wait for a few. Still saving. Is this usually how long is it for sequence? I haven't really looked at your sequence yet. Oh, I mean, yeah, there we go. Now I'm in the sequence. Okay, have you saved it? I'm in Branch 1. Yep, I've already saved it. And now I'm inside Jump It and I'm in Branch 1. All right. So if someone else replied. I'm still having that thing. Oh, you have a reply and nothing happening. You have either one of those, both of those going to Branch 2, which is going to really be the same thing. So I don't understand the logic there. Oh, I see. So should I remove this reply? Yeah, if you just want them where if they opt out, they're done. But if nothing happens, they just go to Branch 2 and it just tries them again in six days. I believe you don't need to reply to. Okay. Because it's just going to send them another email. otherwise as soon as they reply they're going to another get immediately get another email step two or branch two i don't even know what i'm seeing here that if you even need all these branches you could just gun down in a step and seen it in one place yeah so the thing here in this other branches is it possible but yeah so still there's an error here so what i what we want to do is to create like a sequence where we still have to edit per branch because we are not ready yet with our form letters. So I think that's possible, right? Well, as long as you have it in there before somebody would ever get queued up to it. Yep. So before it's 6-day, we can just go back and put the name letters on the Well, you're going to have to have something in there to even activate it. So that could be giving you an error. Because you'd have to have something. You can't just make a step without. Like, it looks like you have the same letter for everything. That's going to be an error. Let's see. Like, you're one, two, three, four. like from letter five step or branch five on it's all the same letter that's going to be an error okay so in five i mean something like this where you just want to send one i don't know like every month or something you might want to just do a mail campaign and that way whoever is ready just gets maybe you put it when you go into like if they don't opt out maybe just put them into a roll-up list and that'll be used for your next letter. And you just have a different sequence when you're ready for that other letter or just as a mail campaign. But you can't have like the same letter being used as just placeholders. So even if it's going to be a different template, I cannot reuse. Well right now you have all the same letter for seven different steps in every every step you cannot use the same letter in the same sequence and so it's from what number what branch from branch five on okay let me just choose a different yeah So you'd have to correct all that first. Yep. But I don't know if I would really use a sequence when you don't know what all the content is going to be yet. Yeah, we are very particular with the email, but what we're going to do is before the sixth day, I'm going to have the right email. But if somebody gets queued up for that step, then they're not going to get the right content if you don't have it in there yet or have it correct in there yet so let's say i have this activated and then suddenly before the sixth day or i have this but anybody that's queued up for it so like if somebody's queued for the next step they're already queued to get whatever they're supposed to get so that can be an issue so what might be better is to have either not do it as a sequence or just have like when this sequence goes put them on and put them on a two like a letter two roll up and then just have a different sequence when you're ready to go when you have the content and then then start that sequence then if i got it right at least there should be ready sequence for form letter two, I mean for branch two. And then for the third one since it's not yet queued, it's safe to say that I can still change whatever the form letter is. You're gonna have to have every letter as even a placeholder like before you can even activate this. And then when you do activate it you're gonna have to go into the letter, I'm sorry, into the activated sequence to itself to make the changes and that because whatever you change in your sequence is going to change your template and what you change in your template is going to change your it is not going to change your activated sequence. Sorry, say that one more time. You can have a template where you have to start with a template to activate a sequence but once you activate a sequence that template in the sequence itself they're not the same so if you were to make any changes you would have to actually go into the sequence that was activated. Like, hold on let me just finish this. Yeah but it sounds like you probably want to schedule more training to work on this. I don't know if you already have a training ticket with like an upgrade. Are you working with a trainer already Yeah, I actually don't have it. So is it possible that I can work for a training ticket for this? Well, you would, I mean, it probably would have to be training time that you purchased. I'd have to see what's in there. Hold on one second. Yeah, they would... Let's see. It would be up to Todd. It looks like he might have an extra hour remaining. If he would...actually hold on one sec, that is older. And that is used. I think he's used...he would probably have to purchase like an hour of training. I see. Okay. Well, then I'll just go ahead and fix this sequence first. Make sure that there's a ready form that is ready for each branches. But I just have a question regarding then the active sequence that I currently have. Not about the, because I'm checking the analytics for the sequence results for the AC. the AC Invalid or ADE or hold on yeah great for Invalid and I don't see any email sent for email to the went through but when I check the set the problems and when I before I have this act before I activate this sequence I check for problems and it says that it's ready for it that the sequence is ready Hello? Are you still there? I'm looking. Oh, yes. Okay. Okay. And are you in... Well, this was sending as you, it looks like, between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. And your Eastern time? Yep, we are in Eastern. Well, you have it going to an email home field. Do you even have those populated for everybody? It's going to a custom field called Email Home. Email Home. So, yeah. It'd have to have, there's a, that first step was set to go to a custom field called Email Home. So if you don't have a value in that field, it can't kick them off in the sequence and send the email. So you would have to end that sequence, fix your template, and then send it as a new sequence. You can't resend it if it... Oh, hold on. I'm just trying to open the sequence. So, this is, is that in value that I mentioned earlier? I mean, that's going to be one thing. I'm just looking through a couple of the names in that roll-up list that's used for that sequence. And that first step was set to send an email to email underscore home, which is a custom field. So if somebody doesn't have a value in that field, it can't send it to them. But let's say there are like five contacts for this sequence. Will that stop? Well, it would only try to send an email if they actually had an email address in that field. Yeah, but it will not, the other contacts will not be affected, right? Like if you go to other, like if you go to other, if you go to your task, you've got at least four people where they, you had the sequence set up to send an email home and they don't have a value in that field. So I'll have to go to that task. You can't kick off an email sequence to a field where there is no email address. I see. That makes sense. Okay. Yeah, Robin, I'll go ahead and double-check further with the sequences, and then you said I have to do a training? Yeah, we would have to go through the contract signer, the main person, because they would have to purchase training. Sorry, does that cause an additional to us? Yes. Okay. All right. No worries. Thank you so much, Robin. You are welcome. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.",
