    "text": " Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi Teresa, is Kathy available? Yes, just a minute please, Robin. Okay, thank you. Hold on, Gabby, I'm calling our bookkeeper to see if she can tell from the back end exactly what the message may be. I know and if this doesn't work what she can do is she can send you yeah I'm going to ask her about that too I'm going to ask her about that too I'm getting her on the phone right now. I get it. I understand. Yes, I see there's, yeah, there's a lot of attempts. So. Hold on, Gabby. One second. I have her on the phone. Hold on one second, Gabby. Hey, Kathy. Yeah. Hi. I have Gabby on a screen share, and I walked her through. We got the country drop-down. It's still coming up as declined, and then we tried just doing like a smaller amount, and it's still saying declined. Are you able to tell exactly why it's declining? I can look and see if I can. Hold on. Let me get into that system. It's a person. If you do personal first, personal baritone, she's kind of getting a little impatient because she's tried so many times. so I guess worst case we sent her because she's international the white wire transfer yeah um let me get this uh let me get them up here yeah it says it says declined um yeah I couldn't see um kind of any details like it just saw a decline it says uh it says transaction not permitted by the card Oh. Okay. So should I be sending her wire stuff then maybe? It's what? Could we send her the wire information? Yep. Okay. Will you do that for me then? Yes. Okay. I'll send it right now. I think I have some other emails that you sent with her details. Yeah, it's the GS email, and I can send it to you again if you need it. Hold on a second. and then we say what was the exact mention about declined by the card action per not permitted by the card or something like that yeah it says transaction not permitted by the card okay well let me tell her that hi Gabby so I am on with our bookkeeping consultant and the message is saying action not permitted by the card so what she's going to do is she's going to send you the international wire details that you can make a payment that way is that okay so we're she's getting that over to you so we'll um you should hear from us very soon on that she'll send it to you she'll send it to you by email in in just a few minutes okay all righty yeah for some reason it's just the card is declining it so not sure why the only other Robin I have one other option if she wants to use the card Gabby hold on one second cuz Kathy's tell me something else hold on one second okay go ahead so if they they really want to use that card I can send her a direct link from QuickBooks where she could put the information into it and they probably won't have the same problems with an international card and she could click the link through QuickBooks and see if she could get her card information in that way and then it could process through QuickBooks. We could do it that way if she'd like to use, really wants to use that card. So, Gabby, she said what she can do is send you a link through QuickBooks if you really want to use the card. And then we might not – no card? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me tell her. Okay. Okay. Hold on one second. Okay. That didn't go over. She said no card. She's been dealing with this too long. Just send the bank information. Okay. Okay. Send me her email. Send me her email so I have it right on top and I'll send it to her. Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Bye.",
