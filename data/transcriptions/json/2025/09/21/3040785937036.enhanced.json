    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Julian Reeves with Chapel Hill Solutions. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, thanks. I guess you're handling all the support volume. Kind of. You know, there's a few other people helping. Gotcha. Okay, cool. Awesome. I feel like we've connected every time I've called, so that's great. Nice, yeah. I just wanted to make sure on copying roll-ups to roll-ups names on the name roll-up I have people in certain stages right of select this stage and I want to preserve that stage if I copy everyone over to a second roll-up I'm able to do that right actually the roll-up stages are specific to that roll up they won't copy over I think I did just try this recently let me double check really quick but as far as I remember yeah thank you I felt like you could like I like you could keep them at one point Copy to roll up. Let's do a rollup test. Preserve rank when copying. I know there's a check mark there. I don't know what that does. Where are you seeing that check mark? Right when it says copy to roll up after I've selected like two people. Oh, right. Right. That's the rank. Let me see if that applied. I'm jumping over. I just made a new test. OK, so, yeah, that doesn't apply to stages. It's a different type of roll up column called rank. That would be copied, but the stage doesn't copy over. That's just specific to each individual roll up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I could do it by-I could just copy over the stage and then bulk select their stage. Sorry, I'm thinking out loud. Yeah, no problem. Let me try something. Okay. Get that roll up list. Oh, they preserved it on mine. Oh, it did. It might be if you select the global roll up stage or whatever. Maybe. But that, I guess that answers my question. I'm glad it worked for you. That's interesting. Yeah, I wasn't able to retain the... Is it like if you get a roll-ups, right, and then you click the edit button, action edit, and then the roll-up stage function, that being the same, and if that's a global roll-up thing, maybe that has to do with it? I don't know. Could be if it was having the exact same set of stages possibly. Yeah, that's a good Good theory there. So you went from one rollup to a brand new one, or did you go to a rollup that already existed? Brand new, renamed it, chose, selected that rollup stage function or whatever, copied it over and preserved it. Awesome. So now I'm going to do select all results. Why isn't that doing that? Oh, okay. Perfect. I figured it out. Thank you. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, reach out if you have any other questions. Will do. Thanks, Garrett. Take care. Bye. Thanks. Bye.",
