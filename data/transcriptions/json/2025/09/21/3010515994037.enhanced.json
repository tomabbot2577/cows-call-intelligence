    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Well, hi, Tyler. This is Irene Kokolak with Professions. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm fabulous. I heard a nasty rumor you weren't there anymore. I am back. You are back. They finally got their heads out of their ass and brought you back. Yep. I ended up coming back. I was gone for a few months. Oh, okay. Hey, I get it. It happens. Look, I was mad, too. Garrett's like, Tyler's not here. What do you mean? Where'd he go? Why is he not there? He's my guy. I'm getting a little upset there. Well, I'm happy to hear your voice. It's good to be back. Because you know what the hell you're doing. I'm sorry. Not everybody knows what the hell they're doing. You do. Well, I appreciate that. I have a weird question. I've been going, I was going back and forth with Garrett on this and it is, he had said to me that you could link in, in the rollup, in a sequence rollup. If they're linked to a position, it removes them from the sequence. Like I guess it completes the sequence. So I got into the sequence that I wanted to try this on. And I guess it's a step, not a condition. so the linking to a position is a step right but then you can have the condition of when that step happens then either remove them from the sequence or complete the sequence so but here's the thing i don't want it to is there a way around that can i just make it a condition of linking to the pipeline? Right. If they're linked, then the sequence is completed. So if they're moved, I don't want it to be a task. Because here's the thing. These are just straight email sequences. It's just happening behind the scenes. So I don't want it to stop because they need to complete a task, which is link them to the position. They're actually going in and calling them. The link to position is an automatic task. Okay. Oh, okay. So if it's done, so it's going to automatically link them. Yep. Okay, and we don't want that because they may not be the correct person. Does that make sense? Yeah. Because ideally what I'd like to happen is here's like, I have it set up that these are going to happen every three days. and then if they reply, sequence is complete. After like the first two emails, like the third email on, if they unsubscribe, the sequence is complete. And if they reply, the sequence is complete. I would like to put a condition in there that if they're linked to the position, like if the recruiter links them to a position, the sequence is complete. They're not going to get any more letters. So there's no way to do that without having the link to position step. Because, like, well, the sequence doesn't know what's going on outside of it. Right, right. Okay. So there's no way around that. No, unless you're manually going and taking them off the roll-up list. Right, right. To a position. see and that just makes sense to me in my mind i'm like all right there's condition that if if they're linked then they're done they don't they wouldn't receive any more emails but it's actually a test it would automatically link them to the position after so many emails and we don't want that correct um all right so this is not going to work then it's not going to work how I want it to work. Yeah, though, like I said, because the sequence only knows what's going on inside of it, if there's like an outside action happening, it's going to require something manual. Right, right. So I'm just going to have to tell her, like, hey, if you talk to somebody and they're it, you're going to have to take them out of the roll-up. Or else they're going to keep getting emails, you know? Okay. That was my question. That, and I'm happy that you're back. I'm happy that I'm back, too. So if you go to email me, my email did change. Oh, all right. Well, here, I'm going to shoot you an email so I get the correct one. What is it? It's ttroutman, at main sequence. So that's T-R-A-U-T-M-A-N. At main sequence dot com? Dot net. ttrapment at main sequence dot net. And I'm just going to put, hi. I have you in my list. All right, I just sent you one. You should get it here in just a second. Come on. Yep, there it is. All right, perfect. Woo-hoo. You're on my list now. You know what that means. I bug you when I have my weird questions. More than happy to answer them. All right. You have a great rest of your day. You as well. All right. Bye, Tyler. Bye.",
