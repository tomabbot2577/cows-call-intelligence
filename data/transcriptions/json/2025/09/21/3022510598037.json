    "text": " Hello? Thank you for calling Mean Sequence Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Jason, hey, it's Scott at Ocean Medical. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm doing good. I've got a question about modifying a sequence. Are you a good person to ask? Yeah. So what's going on? So I've got a sequence that has two steps, right? And I've realized that it should have three. But I've got people in the sequence, I've got records in the sequence that are already being processed per se. They're in a time pause. They're in the queue. and if I modify the existing sequence and add the third step, will the folks that are midstream in the queue, when they pop back up again, do I have the option to trigger that third step? Does that make sense? Yeah, would the third step be tacked on to the end, like after where they currently are? Well, so they're in the queue and when they do populate, I think tomorrow or the day after, I want to be able to put that third step in today, right? So when they do populate, will that third step show up as an option, even though they're already in process per se? Let me pull up the sequence and take a look at it. It might be contextual, and I just want to take a look at it. You betcha. Let me pull it up as well and follow along so we can get the sequence. I think it is titled M-E-L-A something something. yeah go back down to it find it here it is titled yes m-e-l-a v-n jacks j-a-x okay okay the people in the queue One of the folks in the queue is Kristen, K-R-Y-S-T-E-N. I think she's going to come out of the queue in the next day or so, perhaps tomorrow or the day after. And what I realized is that with the two steps that I have in there, I need to add a third. And so if I modify this, if I pause it, edit branches, add the step with the conditions, save it, turn the sequence back on again, when she pops tomorrow, will I see that third step that I've introduced? Yeah. Do you mind if I pause this for just a second so I can go into? Yeah. Let me take a look at this. Edit branches. Okay. And I say add a third. I would actually be adding a fourth, but you get what I'm saying. Yeah, yeah. What was Kristin's last name again? We're just using her as the example. Sure. It's DeFalco. D-E-F-A-L-C-O. DeFalco. Okay. LCO to Falco Okay, and when we're looking at the sequence layout, Kristen's currently in step, well, between step one and step two. You're wanting to add a step between one and two? No, it would be a step four, literally after step three. It would be an add-on. Actually, so it would be two things. The first would be, so here's in layman's terms what I want to do. What I have set up is I've left a message. if they don't respond in eight days I send a bump if they don't respond in another eight days I send a final bump well she responded and instead of just ending the sequence I've realized that I want to send her some information and then set up a new bump series so it would frankly actually be modifying step two that if they do respond that it moves to step four and step four would be sending them like an email sending them an email that's exactly that with additional information um she hasn't gotten to step two but she was populating in step two so go ahead yeah please I would say there's, I don't know if when someone is in the, there's two layers here. The first layer is just kind of rule of thumb with sequencing. If a task has already been populated, you can't edit anything with that task. Like any person who is already there won't see any changes made to the sequence in that step. But anything past that, they would see those steps because it would be generating a new task upon them getting into the steps. The tricky part here is I don't know if the task has been generated already and just kind of waiting to populate or if it hasn't generated yet and will populate when she gets to step two. I would say either way, make the changes. And for the people who are just kind of in this interim location, you might need to just kind of remove them from the sequence and send the email manually. but I don't know where that line is between the task being generated like if it's when they go into the queue or if it's when they come out of the queue but I would say either way you should make those changes and if you see the changes reflected tomorrow we'll know it gets generated after they come out of the queue but if you don't see the changes it would be that it's generated when they go in but either way I would say you should make those changes yeah no i'll do that and i think that's the first statement because it's unclear to me my hypothesis my thought would be that because it's in an eight-day hiatus that it hasn't gone to that next step so i'm hoping that we get a favorable outcome right yeah my thought my thought is also that it's yeah because i think technically it would consider her still in step one like if we're saying that limbo space doesn't actually exist, I would consider her probably still in step one because she hasn't crossed the line into step two. So I would think that any changes made in step two would be reflected. But either way, I would make the change. I'm going to do that. Excellent. Jason, thank you so much for the sounding board. I appreciate it. I'm on it. Thanks, Brian. Yep. Have a good day. Bye. You too. Bye-bye.",
