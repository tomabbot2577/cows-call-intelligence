    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How can I help you? Hey, Garrett. My PCR email alias has gone wonky on me, and I'm wondering if you can talk me through how to fix it. Yeah, absolutely. Let me log into your database. What's your username for PCR? I think it's lsmith. Yep, that is working. Awesome. I'll check to make sure that it's just the alias that's disconnected. Have you guys been having more problems with this? Because I talked with my business partner and he said he was having some similar issues. No, it's basically if there's any passwords that get changed on your email account, you'll need to reestablish the connection from PCR to your mail provider. And also, mail providers will have you reconnect after a while, just if it hasn't been connected in a long time. Okay, that must be it. So, yeah, this is kind of, you know, routine. This will happen. But I'm checking. It looks like some of your mail servers might need connected, too. So I'll show you how to do both. So at the top right of PCR, go to the gear icon to the right of your profile picture. And there'll be a drop down where you can select email, the first option there. This will open up PCR mail in a new tab and you're looking for configure at the top left and another gear icon. And then let's start by going to... Mail servers. servers will be a good starting place here. Down below, it looks like you have three mail servers. Do you know which ones you're still using? We don't do Bluehost anymore. It's the G Suite. Okay. And then, so yeah, let's edit that. So at the very bottom where it says LORI IMAP new, use the action dropdown to the left of that to select edit. Now I'm worried that for some reason that might not be true. I can't imagine we're using Bluehost. I mean, our Gmail is through Gmail now. Yeah, it might be. So what we could do is just move that one to – We could do our website through Bluehost. Right, okay. That makes sense. Yeah, let me see. I'll check to see if there's anything in your inbox recently on that. Okay, yeah. Let's leave that Bluehost one on because you do have things in there from as recent as 7.26 date-wise. So I think it is being used. And that one is connected. That one doesn't need edited. And then let me check G Suite. Your inbox there hasn't really been set up. Okay. Okay, so yeah, I actually do think the LORI IMAP new through Bluehost is the correct and current mailbox. Let me make sure one thing on that, that you have your sent folder mapped. Okay, and your... Because the G Suite, you're not seeing anything at all? Yeah, it looks like it's empty when I go to the G Suite inbox there. Okay. whereas yeah the lorry has has stuff very recent 726 so can you read me what 726 is let's see the emails from Sierra clearance event 75% okay for that new text now I see how I can remember central open I'm up new emails it says no messages in box let's see Oh, okay. Thank you. Oh, wait, but it is showing. Yeah, no, this hasn't been used in a long time. Okay. There's just one email from 2025 that's a spam email, and then the other ones are like from 2024. Okay, so maybe it is G Suite, but G Suite does need reconnected again, I think might be the problem then. So let's look at that. So if you go back to configure up at the top, go to mail servers. Let's start by using the action drop down to the left of Lori IMF new and hit edit. And then where it says active at the bottom left, just switch that to no. So that one we know not to pay attention to anymore. The G Suite? No, the Lori IMF new. Okay, very good. Yeah. Okay. Yep. And so then once that's switched to no, just hit save. And we'll know not to pay attention to that one. Then for G Suite, use the action drop down to the left of that to go to edit again. And then click on sign in with Google at the bottom left. And that should prompt you to sign into the correct Google account. And it'll... You can post then to permanently delete all your email from Gmail. So I click on that. Yeah, you want to consent to anything and then continue. Okay. And then it should have filled out everything and reestablished the right password in there. Just a test connection down at the bottom. The password, for some reason, now has become a million words, so I'm going to enter it again. Oh, no, that's good. That's an encrypted password. That's what the clicking on the blue button did. It gave it the correct type of. So, yeah, if you backspace that, that's all right. You could just hit sign in with Google again. It'll enter in the encrypted password. So why does it have a weird password thing? It becomes encrypted so that it has extra security built into it. It's not going to be your your letter for letter password up there. OK, so test connection. Yeah, test connection. And we're hoping for green lettering somewhere in that test result. green lettering. I see nothing there. It says, okay, GI map ready for requests, capability, blah, blah, blah, buy logout requested. Okay, good day. Success. So it's not green, but it says success. Okay. Go ahead and close that test and hit save. And then I'll just refresh on my end and just double check that. Let's see. G Suite. Yeah. Okay. That's in good shape. And then you can close that pop-up there. And then next we'll go to alias address list at the top center. And that will, in the bottom frame, show you your different email aliases where you're sending out from. Let's see. Are you using all three of those? I am. Okay. So we'll have to click on the pencil icon. Let's do the first one on the left there. and click on sign in with Google again and it'll connect to that Google account. So if I have this happen again it's just really just going through that sign-in process because Google's decided they want security and I do this and then I'm done. Right. Test connection, got it. Okay that does have a green on the okay. Oh Oh, excellent. Do that with all three. Just, yeah, hit save. Once you've signed into Google once, it might not prompt you, hey, which email address do you want to sign into? Like, for example, the next one you're about to do is Chris. You don't want it to just automatically connect to Lori instead of Chris. So in that case. Oh, it says drop address Lori at ChrisTrizzo.com. Reply to address Chris at ChrisTrizzo.net. Right. So instead, go ahead and close that one without saving it. That's fine. We'll have to use a incognito window so that it doesn't pre-sign you in to the LORI one. Oh, interesting. And the third one, it looks like, is a, Laurie, it ends in .net. So that'll be probably the same issue. We'll have to do it in an incognito window. So to do that, you just go to the three dots at the top right of your browser. There should be an option for new incognito window. This is interesting. I think I screwed something up here because as you were talking, I was going ahead of you. And so I went ahead and did the authentication for the ChrisTurzo.net. And so now when I look at that, it had before had Chris at ChrisTruzzo.net, but now in that window under the alias and address list, it says Lori at ChrisTruzzo.com, which was not the case before. The Lori.net address has Lori at ChrisTruzzo.net. Okay, that's fine. We'll be able to adjust that in the incognito. Yeah, not a problem. So yeah, three dots at the top right of your browser and then go to new incognito window. Yeah. And you'll just want to navigate back to PCR and sign in. Okay, that's going to take me finding the interface. Give me a second. I'm just copying it from my... Oh, there you go. Okay. Oh, good. When Powell came up, that's interesting. I have to remember if I know my password for PCR. Got it. Okay. All right. I'm back in. So now we're going up to the configure email. Yep, here, email. Come on, Bevis. Invalid email credentials. It says invalid email credentials were detected for alias PC recruiter email address Lori at ChrisTurzo.com. Okay, yeah, that might be an older message. That's fine. We'll clear out those notifications at the end here once we have everything connected up. So, and then go to Chris Terzo. Yep. Sign in with Google. Should I do it at the address Chris at ChrisTerzo.net or Laurie at ChrisTerzo.com? You'll want to do the Chris at ChrisTerzo.net when you sign in with Google. Okay. Oh that was dumb sorry you said Laurie Chris Terzo that that you mean Chris at Chris Terzo not that Chris yeah yeah at this second email a list of my flow it up sign in email or phone Chris Chris see if I know this password hmm Oh hmm Oh boy, the password's not working. I'm going to have to see if my admin person knows the password. Okay. Dang it. Dang it. But yeah, once you do sign in on that one, you just test that connection in Cognito and it won't have, you know, we did that so it didn't pre-save the LORI login and just fill that in every time. All right. I will call you guys back if I have trouble with that and I will test the first one and make sure it's working. excellent and then yeah um i would close out of your incognito window altogether and open a whole new one when you do that third alias the one that ends in dot net the lori did you both dot net alias yeah but um yeah let us know if you have trouble but your incoming mail is connected and that first email alias should be connected already okay great thank you so much no problem Yeah, reach out if you need anything else. Okay, you take care. Bye.",
