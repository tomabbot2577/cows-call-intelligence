    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Hudson with NextLink Internet. We've gone back and forth the email a few times. How are you? Good. How are you? I know you probably have a big question mark over your head. Yeah, I'm pulling it up. I'm sorry. Okay. Don't worry about it. Hudson Stable with NextLink. Okay. What did we email back and forth? The monthly invoices. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. um yeah hold on one second sure okay sorry okay yes it looks like i have a note here on may 23rd that i modified the account to use your billing email address okay yes yeah we uh had change in our management and so we kind of to change a few things around. But I'm seeing a little bit of information on like our current billing cycle and everything like that with PCR. Okay. Yeah, so right now we have a monthly invoice, right, of $396.34, right? Let's see what yours is. Bear with me one second. your invoices currently go out on the 17th of each month and there are four four users at $95 per user. Yeah, so it's like $380 and then with that little increase after first year, it's $396.34. Okay, so it's for four users or? Yeah, it's $95 per user. Okay. Okay. And if we wanted to delete one or two of those user accounts, that's something that I would call you about? Yeah. If you are, like, let's say your user count ever increases or decreases, we just need to have you let us know before the next billing cycle. And we make a ticket and we just have, we just adjust the next invoice. we can't go by what's actually in the database although we do occasionally do an audit just because you know sometimes people fail to tell us um we rely on you to let us know because some of those users might be like api users or like it was a test user so you just need to yeah just let us know before and we actually prefer to have a couple days just because you never know um sure I guess also do we pay a yearly subscription? No it's just that flat monthly so your contract is probably yeah your contract is annual but you're paying you're paying it monthly okay does that make sense? It does so we pay we sign up for a year long contract and then we pay monthly on that. Correct Okay when does our contract expire? um it looks like your contract expires on may 30th of each year okay and then that's when we does it automatically renew based off of that yeah there's an auto renew clause in the contract that unless you have like 30 days notice it just automatically renews gotcha that's automatically it is okay and and there's no like contract fee. It's just like, in other words, we don't get like, hey, $1,000 contract fee every year and then you pay on top of that the four seats that we pay for. Now, what you probably had in the very beginning was like a one-time setup fee to create the database, probably covered the training that was offered in that onboarding process. So that you might have had a fee then, but then after that, it's just monthly. Gotcha. Gotcha. Okay. um all right well i don't think i have any other questions at this time i actually i do have a question let's um obviously so obviously if we want to get if we want to reduce the quantity of users we'll reach out to you we go down to like three or two or even four to increase users we'll reach out to you correctly or do we have an account manager for that yeah yeah you can just email support at main sequence.net that creates a ticket and just say like i need to go from four to two users or whatever the account is. And then we'll have somebody with access to the billing just make those changes for you. Gotcha. And then if we decide to, let's say, if we decide to cancel before the expiration date, do we have to pay a fee? Yeah. The contract has that there's an 80% of the remaining contract early cancellation fee. Okay. So, it expires in May. That means we have to pay, and however much payment sequences are up until May 30th of 2026, we have to pay 80% of that. Correct. Gotcha. Oh, well, now, here's another question. Let's say right now we want to cancel one or two seats moving forward. Do we have to pay 80% of that? No. No, that we don't do. gotcha gotcha okay all right thank you very much this has been very very helpful you are welcome have a great week you too bye",
