    "text": " JP Hi JP it's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter How are you? Good how are you doing? I am well I got your email Friday I think it was I wanted to give you a quick call Back to kind of what questions Were you thinking about the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter And the upgrade and everything Yeah I appreciate you getting back to me I actually ended up talking to One of the guys that works for you guys He may have been on the support team but he answered some questions for me. Excellent. So I guess I just want to make sure I understand things clearly. So if I want to add like a sequence or like a campaign, do you guys call them sequences? Yeah, yeah, sequence. Yeah, so like if I want to add a sequence into PCR, are. I'll have to go through and create like each step of that along the way. And then is there a way to like individually put one person into that sequence or does the sequence only get applied to certain people in a roll-up? Well, it is based off of a roll-up list, but what you can do is put it applied to an empty roll-up list and then add the individuals to that roll-up list one at a time. And as you do, each time you add someone to a list, it's going to start them in that sequence when they're added. So that essentially lets you add the one at a time as you go. Okay. And then as far as emails go, like those emails, they get sent, like say I put like 10 people in at a time. Do all 10 of those get sent at the same time? or do you guys have something built in where you kind of meter out how the emails go? Either one. So they're going to start as they're added. So if you added 10 at once, they would each get one. But on your sequences, you can say only send two per hour or 50 per day or something like that, so you can limit how many go out. And then if you had five per day and you added 10, it would send five today and then five tomorrow. So that's up to you. Okay. Yeah, but does it send them all at one time, or does it kind of schedule them at, like if you say five per day, does it schedule five over the course of a day? I think it's by default going to send them all together, but you can also choose to put a pause between each send. So that's another setting. So you could say put a couple-minute pause between each send or something like that. You can tweak it a little bit. Usually what I do personally, if I'm sending one out, I just say 50 a day. And then usually what it does is at a certain time when I say to start the sequence in the morning, it'll send 50 right then. And then that kind of gives the people all day to read them and respond and everything like that. And then the next day, they'll get 50 more. Gotcha. My concern with doing that is since they get sent through our email servers directly, like I get concerned about getting blacklisted, put on a spam list. if they're going directly out from our servers. Add people one at a time or put spaces in between. You can put a little pause in between, or you could always use something like SendGrid. Get a SendGrid account to send through. It still comes from you, but it's going through their server so you don't get blacklisted, so that helps a little bit too. That's another kind of work we'll do. Okay. Yeah. All right. And then the different steps of the campaign. What are the different step choices? Like there's obviously an email step. There's a phone call step, I assume. Is there a LinkedIn or multiple LinkedIn type steps? There can. So there's going to be an email, either an automatic form letter or a manually composed email. That would pop up a little email window to you. You can have a phone call. You can have a text. That depends on RingCentral. So if you have RingCentral, you can send a text. You can have a LinkedIn-related item. It could be a send in mail or a send a connection request or I think even just view their LinkedIn page. And then there's a schedule option. So you can schedule a call. So you can kind of put them on your schedule list. And I think that's it. So let's see. Emails, calls, SMS, LinkedIn, schedule. Oh, pipeline. If you're running it based off of a certain pipeline, you can move them from one pipeline step to another if it's related to a specific job. So that's one. Gotcha. A little bit lesser used, but that's another one. and the different steps whenever they come up, do they come up within PCR or do they come up through Outlook? How do they get scheduled and reminder? How do the reminders come up? They're all going to be in the task list in PCRecruiter. So when you click sequences, that opens up a whole new window that you can kind of minimize and just keep as a separate tab, actually. And that's going to be your to-do list, And that will have little boxes for schedule items, LinkedIn items, calls to make, everything like that. Gotcha. Okay. All right. And you said we're already paying for this. We just need to get it turned on basically. Yeah. If you wanted to add it, it's just a $250 setup that would get you a couple hours training on it. I think it would include a couple template sequences, but it's no more monthly. unless you wanted to add the PCRM. That's that whole new CRM piece, that new interface that we looked at too. That's an additional setup and additional monthly cost. But if you want to just speak with me, just one time $250. That'll get it turned on and you'll be good to go. Okay. All right. I'm most likely going to do that, so I don't know what you need to send me to get that started. I need to talk to one of the guys that works with me just to make sure it's something that we're going to mess with. But I know from using Force Whale for a little period of time that it definitely helps to kind of automate some of that stuff. Yeah. Well, what I could do, let me get you over an invoice. I'll have an invoice sent over, and you'll have it. And that way, if you do decide you're ready to go, just pay the invoice. they'll let me know and we can get a ticket in to get it installed and get the training going. Okay. And how long does it usually take to get it up and running? A couple of days. A couple of days. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Yeah, go ahead and send me an invoice for it and I'll get it back to you. Very well. All righty. I appreciate it, Jim. Great. I'll talk to you in a couple of days. I'll follow up and I'll have that sent. Okay. Bye-bye. Sounds good. Bye-bye. Okay. Bye.",
