    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. to someone about the... I think that's it. Okay. Hello? Hello, Jordan, do you hear me? Hello, Jordan, do you hear me? Hey, Jim there. Yeah, I didn't know if you heard me that first time. I saw you dial in and I couldn't hear you, but now here we are. Yeah, how are you? Here we are. I am doing great, man. How are you? It's been a minute since you and I chatted. For sure. For sure. Yeah, yeah. We're doing all right. Doing all right here. Plugging along and doing okay. I understand you guys are leaving. You guys are having a good time? Yeah, yeah. Doing all right. Yeah, and you all are leaving SRA, I think, in about a week. We are leaving SRA, yes, sir, in about a week. Yeah, it's been a phenomenal five years. Well, we just kind of got to the point. I don't know how much you remember about us, but we were part of MRI back in the day, too. So we've been in the franchise world for as long as we can remember. And there's just a point in which we just want to, yeah, I think we just want to kind of spread our own wings and see what happens. You've built it. You've got a huge, I'm sure, a huge customer base. You've got a nice large user base. It's certainly time. Yeah, man. So let's chat about PCR and let's chat about what we can do from a contract standpoint. And let me tell you where I'm coming from. I've been thinking about an analogy that would work well for us today. Think about the person who just got out of a long-term relationship and is now looking at like, hey, listen, I just got out of a five-year relationship. I'm not thrilled about wanting to lock into more long-term relationships. That is the disposition that we are coming from. It is not from a disposition of like being discontent in any way, shape, or form with BCR, you, your team, right? Everything has been fantastic. We've loved the flexibility and creativity and autonomy that you guys have given us in helping to shape the system and the field and the back end to what we need. we're just looking at it from like, okay, so how can we kind of, in some way, like take back some more control where we feel like we've been locked into other things. So that's where the spirit of the conversation from my end is coming from, has nothing to do with anything that PCR has done or hasn't done over the last five years of us working together, if that makes sense. Okay, sure, sure. Certainly it does. Yeah. Yeah. So you won't, I think you're under the three-year contract now. And we, outside of SRE, we really don't offer a three-year contract that's why theirs is so unique and wildly so much lower than everybody else's uh because they for some reason talked with our owners they wanted a three-year we agreed to it and that's that but most of the time we don't do a three-year um i thought there's no uh i have to get it up from that 50 number it doesn't have to like double or anything like that which is great uh some of the other ones have a specific percentage it must go up so we don't have a minimum like that um the list price on the package which all they're looking at I think is 115 per user per month so you guys are already getting a phenomenal deal of 50 I think what we were talking about was we were doing we offered two terms a one year or a two year depending on how long I didn't even broach a three year and for the two year I was able to do 65 per user per month the one year 75 per user per month keeping your same package your same users nothing would change and And I don't think we would need to change the name of, like, your database or anything like that, because I don't think you ever moved to anything formally SRA. No. Everything in our database is Bridger Group. There's no SRA emblems. Yeah, just our URL has SRA on it. Yeah, I noticed it has it, but that's only you, like, office-facing. nobody else would really see that. Yes. Yes. With the difference between the two-year and one-year contract, what is the minimum accounts that we need to have in that? And is there any way in the world we get down to 65 per user per month with a one-year contract, given the history that we have in the last five years in PCR, as well as the growth that we have? Because we are, I'd tell you, and you recognize this, where we've been. We're about 12 years in 2020, 2021 when we joined y'all. We're just under 40 right now. Our plans are to double again in the next five years. So we are certainly a growing customer for sure. Oh, for sure. Yeah. You all have grown pretty regularly as we've moved along through. Yeah. So not looking for a two-year. Let me see. So I'm a 75. I could probably do, if you're looking for a one year I think I can do 69 and the reason being because some of the other specials that we offer have a 69 rate and we don't like to go under that rate for some of those other specials that's a little lower than I think the MRI rate between you and me but we don't like to go much below 69 would could you get it done could I could 69 get it done 69 get to that absolutely okay just so yeah just because I can't go any lower than that but that raises it up enough over 50 that ownership's not going to show alarm saying, oh, it's too cheap. It's still a great deal as opposed to- And I totally understand, right? Where the group purchasing power of SRA and the numbers that they have versus a 40 person firm like ours are going to be different. Yeah, I'm just looking to see, okay, so like we're looking at controlling costs as well as much as we can. Also, and again, from my intentions, like we're going to be with PCR. Yeah, I've loved it. Like this has been a great relationship and I've loved it. And our team has gotten great feedback. I'm just trying to get into the position as I look at all of the contracts that we have, LinkedIn and Zoom Info and CallLogic and RingCentral and all these other things. I'm trying to consolidate them and shorten them to the point of like, you know, like again, we just had a five-year commitment with SRA. It's like, all right, how can we shorten the duration of all these contracts as much as possible so that we can revisit them, you know, kind of just not feel like we're locked into any one thing. Sure. Keep it fluid because you never know what's going to happen, and it's always sometimes better just kind of after having such a long commitment to not have that commitment over your heads. Everything else. And that's really the sentiment behind it. Like I said, you guys have been great. We've enjoyed it. And I'm kicking myself that it took us so long to get on the PCR from CAPS. I mean, are they even still around? Does anyone use them? I don't think so. I, maybe a year ago, had somebody that converted off of CAPS. And they must have been the last one. But I don't run into them almost ever anymore, even in the old long-term offices. I don't know that anybody's really using them anymore. Are their websites still active, BBDP? I never want to hear BBDP again. I think what they did, as I recall, the owner, was it Brad? Brad Biaki? Is that who that was? I think. I think he owned it, and then he started his own franchise, much like a mini MRI. But I think he required – and this was probably been eight, ten years since I talked about it – he required them to use caps, but they weren't allowed to use anything else. So if you had that specific franchise with him, you were stuck in caps. And I talked to a couple people that wanted to leave, and they hated it. They were trying to do anything they could to leave, and I think their contract said they had to stay in caps. So I think there are a few people still using it, but it's only the small maybe dozen or two dozen people that are still working under his umbrella. But outside of that, nobody still uses it. Certainly nobody in MRI or any of the other groups that had used to use it. Yeah, that's just crazy. Well, cool, man. Well, I appreciate it. Also excited to hear about some of the new AI features that are coming into PCR as well. I mean, we've been using ChatGPT more and more in certain ways of sourcing and things like that, and it's crazy effective in how it can help cut down just research time. Oh, yeah. That's nice stuff. And it's a free trial for the summer, so they've kind of loaded it into the database, so you should see that in there, some of the stuff. Cool. Just in there. So what I can do is let me prepare the – What is the cost of the AI generation? after the summer? What does that look like? I think it's like $5 a user a month. At your user, I could probably do it cheaper than that. No setup, just adds in a little if you chose to keep it. You get a nice month and a half, two months to look at. I think they're talking about keeping it active until Labor Day. You have some time to test it out and give it a try. See what you think. Cool. Yeah, we have a whole tech committee here. I want to make sure that gets its full attention with us so we can see how it's working and if we want add that after the free trial. For sure. And if there's any questions on that or they want to take a look at it with me, let me know and I can kind of talk with them, answer field any questions about it or anything there. And I've got you. You're still the signer, Jordan? Yep, still the signer. Perfect. And still at 630 Kenmore Avenue, Southeast Suite 204. That's it. Fantastic. So what I'll do, I will email over the paperwork so you have that to go because I know you'll probably want to get it signed before the 31st. I will, I'm on vacation next week, so I'm out all next week. I'm going to be checking email on and off. Oh. We'll be in full time, so just to let you know that. But yeah, I'll send it over. No, hey, hey, take your time. Don't check it. You send it over. We'll take a look at it. We should have it back to you by Friday. Fantastic. Yeah, that'll be good. Then we can get the change made. Make sure once SRA's done, just so they don't come saying, oh, they don't have our pricing anymore. That'll be done and taken care of before then. So that'll be all good. where are you going for vacation? Outer Banks just we haven't been there in about a decade so we're taking our kids out there and we've been going to Cape Cod for several years and the beaches are a little bit colder up there so I think they'll like to have a beach where you can actually go in the water and it's a little bit warmer than what we've been used to yeah for sure well that'll be fun man for sure for sure all right well I will get that over anything you need at any time let me know if you want to look at the AI any questions on anything else. Just as always, you know where I am. Just let me know and I'm here to help. I appreciate it. And appreciate your flexibility in working with us. We're excited to fly solo and make sure that PCR is right along with us. For sure. And we're glad to be along with you. Great. Thanks, man. Looking forward to you in contact and have a great, if we don't talk, great vacation next week. Hope to. You have a great afternoon. Thanks for the time today. Thanks. See ya. already bye now",
