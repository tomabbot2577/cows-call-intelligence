    "text": " Thank you for calling Maine Sequel Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. My name is Bob Sullivan. I'm a customer. And I'm just curious. I use a Mac to use PC Recruiter. I use the ASP. And for about the last four to five weeks, PC Recruiter keeps crashing. like the browser like goes and like wherever I'm at, I have to reopen the browser and log back in. And I thought it would, I just, I guess I assume it would just go away. I didn't know if there was a bug or a fix or I don't really know what's going on, but I've been a user for PC Recruiter for like 20 years. I've never really had this issue. Is there a known issue with using the ASP on browsers using Macs at all? So I guess I have some questions. When you say it crashes, do you mean like you just – like in the middle of you working, it will just stop working? Yep. it'll just go to a no page, almost like not even my homepage. It just goes like error. Like there's some type of a – I don't have an example right now, you know what I mean? But like I've gone in and deleted files. Like I don't know what to do. It's almost like it just stops working and I have to hit – I have to open it in a browser again and log back in. And it's like the page just goes to like a non-working page, like an error page. Okay. Is this in the middle of your workflow, like as you're working? Oh, it happens. At this point, it's happening about 10 to 12 times a day. Oh, wow. and I didn't know if it was like if it's one of these like I'm not the most technical person but um I could show you I can't reenact it you know what I mean I can kind of show you when it happens like it just happened again and I'm finally like okay something's going on here um I'm clicking around right now maybe it'll happen while we're on the phone but um you know, basically, you know, wherever I am in the workflow, I have to log back in, pull up the roll-up list I was working on and start again. And now it's happening so much. It's like, it's really starting to prevent me from being effective working. Cause it's, you know what I mean? I'm losing my place on the roll-up list. You know what I mean? It's, it's ruining my day, so to speak. Okay. Um, so can you log into my system and make sure like everything is the way it's supposed to be like is there a is there a download like is there has there been an update i'm not aware of um well if there was an update and you're on the asp then you would just have the updated code immediately uh you don't have to you specifically you do not have to update it or anything like that um and and you're saying it could happen at any point like there's no specific action you're doing it's like at any point in time correct that is correct There's no specific action. You know, a lot of times I'm working off of roll-up lists. So that's probably something that's more consistent than anything. But, yeah, it just happens. And basically, throughout my day, I am logging back into my PC Recorder homepage, you know, the login screen, you know, that says what's new, 07, PCR capture update 2.1.2. you know that's why i was thinking is it is it a is it a plug-in or i don't know no the capture tool shouldn't have an effect on the actual um the browser login um so did you you said for the last four or five weeks it it wasn't happening before that time no it was never happening and then it just it started happening and it started happening more you know and I've been working a lot more hours lately so now it's starting to happen a lot and it's starting to drive me nuts okay did you four or five weeks ago did you change anything about uh your office no my computer computer nope I have a new ISP internet no nothing has changed I I have had a Mac for years um I haven't changed my internet um there's not nothing has changed on my computer. You know, I know sometimes I've had issues before where I have to go to downloads, not downloads. What is it? Oh, delete browsing data. I've had to do that before. I know that sometimes I use PCR mail and I know I've had issues with mail before where they've suggested going in and deleting cache images and files. I don't know if I have too much browsing history. You know what I mean? I'm not really sure what to do. Let me ruminate on all this information you've given me here. Just a sec there, Bob. I'm going to log in to your database. Yeah, give me one second. Okay. Yep, it's default database. All right. What company are you with? There's a couple Bob Sullivans, actually. Accountants Direct, Atlanta CPA Search, one of those. Okay. Yep, that's it. Yeah. Default database. Okay, and your username? It's Bob. Just Bob, okay. And it should be Sadie321$. Okay, yeah. Yeah. got all right okay the database does not have anything in the like the whitelist ip address thing all right um Yeah, do you use a VPN? No, I don't think so. No, okay. No, I just, I have Xfinity Internet. I'm wondering, is there something wrong with my laptop? but I've had no issues with my Mac ever so that's why I'm thinking it's not like a PC where I don't know the Mac has never given me an issue are you just working in the August roll up right now? I was earlier yeah that's a birthday I'm not exactly sure what's happening. I'm trying to kind of just ask questions and flesh out the scenario here. So could you just go over a couple of things you do inside the roll-up list just to maybe try and click around here and see if I can read it? For example, what I would do is I would go to a name and I would hit the LinkedIn profile and I wish people happy birthday. that would be a typical yeah on linkedin okay so you know i may update their record if they've changed jobs you know that would be a thing i would do if they've changed jobs i may i may update their the the url okay all right so you're just clicking through names and updating the I'm clicking through names. Yeah. You'll click and it'll just go to like the page with the sad face. It'll say like page has. Yes. Yes. It just happened to you? No, I'm just, I could picture it. There's like a little. Oh yeah. Yes. That's exactly what. Okay. Yes. That's exactly what happens. I've seen that before, but. I mean, a number of things can cause that. Do you think doing anything like deleting my cookies or browsing, download data, browsing history, like, do you think it's something that I've, like, I haven't done maintenance on my computer? Like, I don't understand. Like, I don't have any updates. You know, there's no updates or anything that are pending. Let me see. Software update installed, you know, 15 point. It doesn't look like I have any checking for updates right now. like I, at first I thought it was my, yeah, my Mac is up to date. I think it's not that, um, I guess, um, I, I don't think there's a known issue right now, but I guess that is a possibility, uh, where like maybe your cash could be like so full that it's causing issues. Um, when's the last time you cleared all that stuff out, like cleared your cookies in cache? Well, you know, if I go to the delete browsing data, I haven't deleted – the only thing I ever do is delete cached images and files. I haven't deleted any other stuff. I don't think I ever do it. Should I – I have right now – maybe you can tell me, Like in my browsing history, it has 26,731 items. Download history, it has like 2,500 items, cookies and other from 1,216 sites. Is that too many? That could be very well the issue. You're using Google Chrome, right? Yes. if you wanted to kind of test this theory without having to clear that out yet you could potentially maybe like use another browser like if you have safari or i don't know microsoft edge will be on a mac but you could test that theory by just using another browser for a while and see if you get that issue there and if if another browser can like work just fine for a longer period of time than Google Chrome will, then that could be very well the issue. That could be like a, uh, a sign that maybe your cache is too full. Um, cause I think the storage in Google Chrome like has a limit, like they can't just store unlimited things in there. So it could be that I would, I would try and use another browser for like a couple hours and see if it happens. And if it doesn't, then that could be just that you have to clear out your cache. in Chrome and then it should work for a while until it's... Well, should I just go ahead and delete it and just... You know what I mean? Should I just do it? Why have to test it? What's the downside? The downside is you'll have to log into everything again and you won't have your browsing history, which some people really rely on that kind of thing, where the browser keeps your session IDs for all the things you've already logged into. So when you go to the website, it just kind of like logs you in again automatically. So if you clear all that out, you'll have to re-log in again everywhere, which if you're okay with that, then yeah, you can probably try that and see if it helps. Otherwise, the test would be to kind of maintain that stuff and then see if that's the case. But you could do that as long as you know that that's going to happen and you're okay with, you know, re-logging into everything. It could very well be the case because PCR shouldn't do that. And you're definitely not reaching your timeout limit because you're like active. You know, you're. Yeah, I'm using it in active sessions. Yeah, right. So it's not that you have a static IP address, I'm assuming. Well, I guess I didn't ask that. You said nothing changed. So that's why I asked about your Internet provider and your computer. uh the ip address um that you log into like yeah the um it's a part of your session id when you log into pcr so every time you log in you get a new like session id and it's kind of linked to your ip so if your ip address is dynamic there's a such thing as a dynamic ip address um if that changes uh then it could like trick pcr into thinking that the session is no longer valid because part of the session ID is tied to the IP that you logged in with. So if you have an internet service provider that is giving you different IP addresses or whatever, if you have a VPN switching your IP address all the time, that could cause that symptom. But if you're saying that you've not changed anything and it only just started happening, then I don't think that's the case. That's why I didn't go into that before. But that could be one thing that causes that symptom. I wonder, yeah, I kind of do want to know if it is the cache causing it, because I would like to ask my developers if that's something that we could do anything about. But I would want to know for sure that that's the thing. So if I go to the delete browsing data, it says basic or advanced. So when I go into basic, browsing history is checked, cookies and other data, cache images is checked, I could just go delete data and then restart my computer? Yeah, if you want to do that and you're okay with everything logging out. Is it going to delete passwords? I think that's under the advanced section. In the advanced section, there's passwords and sign-in data. If you don't have the passwords and other sign-in data checkbox checked. Do not have that checked, and then those will be maintained. You might want to clean out that stuff. On the basic. I'm going to do the basic data. I'm going to do it right now, and then I'll restart my computer and then see if that changed anything. I hope I didn't do anything bad. no it's it's okay um clearing that stuff the basic stuff is totally fine if i go so i'm doing the basic one right now should i go into advanced and do and and do anything on that too um no i think that the basic is really what you want to to clear out browsing history cookies and cached images and files. And should I restart the computer after I'm done? You don't have to restart the entire computer for that. Just closing Chrome and reopening it would be sufficient. All right. Yeah. All right, let me see if this... Okay, let me see if this works. Delete Chrome data. The selected data has been removed from Chrome and sync devices. Your Google account may have other forms of browsing history, like searches and activity from other Google services. Okay, got it. All right, let me see if this could be the solution. I guess I won't know until I keep pounding on PC Recruiter. About how often does it happen? Like after you get kicked out and you got to re-log in, how long will it take for it to happen? You know, well, the more I'm, if I'm pounding it, it could happen twice in an hour. Oh, okay. Okay. So if you're very active. It's happening multiple times a day. Yeah. And it's like, it's starting to like affect my workflow. So I just didn't know if there was something else, you know, that was going on. I didn't know if it was an issue that was maybe Mac generated or I didn't know. So anyway, well, I'll give it a shot here. I'll get back on and let me see if I can, if it clears out. I also have a computer guy. I can always call him and see what he says. Yeah, if that doesn't help, just call back, and I have notes that I took on our call. I'll put these notes in an activity under your name in our database. Yeah, thank you. I appreciate it. Whoever you get to can look that up and start from there. But I hope that does it, because I'm not really too sure. if it's not the dynamic IP address. I think that must, that's probably like what it is because there's not many things that would cause that symptom. Like you're actually clicking around in the database and then it just randomly like kicks you out. That's kind of odd. So it's definitely not supposed to be that. Yeah, and it just started happening weeks ago and then it didn't happen. And that seems like it's happening more and more. And I don't know if I wasn't in those four or five weeks that he said, have you cleared your cash in that time at all? So like right now, I now I'm on a brand new like. I haven't quit. I haven't. No, I haven't. Open PC URL. It says, OK, always allow. Always allow open PCR URL. and it says rounded look. I hate the rounded look, by the way. You can turn that off. You can? You know, I feel like it's really hard to see the symbols when they're round. It seems like they're a lot less visible. You could go back to the classic look if you want. I can? Yeah. While you're logged in, in the top right, there's like a little cog wheel next to your picture. Yep. Go to change my theme. And then in the very top, it says rounded look in a dropdown. You can change that to classic look. That will actually kick you out, and you have to reload it so it loads the classic look, though. Okay. Wow, default. I didn't even know these were all choices. Default font size. I could do bigger font. Large font size. Okay. All right, cool. I've never seen this before. All right. All right, cool. Thank you so much. Are you there? Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh, yeah, there you are. Something happened. I'm not sure what happened. Sorry, I bumped my microphone cord and it shorted it out. Oh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just logged in. I had to log out. And I guess I'm now... Yeah, classic look is... Classic look is up now? Yeah, so, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like this look better. there's another setting in there called automatic search resize um okay let me look at that if you if you were to run a search the bottom frame will expand down until you click a record then it will expand up again that's what that one does it's kind of weirdly named so i just want to explain that but there's just a couple settings we added within the past couple years about automatic search resize i don't have no so yeah should i try it and see if i like it Yeah, you could always turn it on or off. But what that does is after you run a search, the bottom frame will just expand so you can see more of the search results. And then when you click on a search result, it'll come back up. It's just a way to avoid having to drag the bottom frame up and down after you run a search. Yeah, it's making me log into my LinkedIn again. So I must have logged out a lot of times. Yeah, after you clear out your browser cache, you'll have to re-log into everything once again. But it's probably good that you clear that out every so often. Yeah, I'll start doing that. Maybe that was the issue. Let's keep our fingers crossed. Yeah, hopefully. Just call us back and let us know if that's still happening. Because it could be like a Mac issue, if not. Because I guess less people use Macs than Windows PCs. So we might not get that many reports of it. Um, so you might be like one of the first people to report that if it is an issue. So definitely we'd want to know if that's like consistently happening. Um, so I'll, I'll put notes here on your name and hopefully, hopefully that fixes it. Um, but yeah, let us know if not. All right, cool. All right. Well, thank you very much for your help. All right. Yeah. Good luck, Bob. Sorry about that. Don't be sorry. I I'm, I'm optimistic. It worked. All right. So great. hopefully I'll keep my fingers crossed thank you alright well have a good rest of your day alright",
