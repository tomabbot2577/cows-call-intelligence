Have like like 11 a.m. or 9 a.m. available. 9 a.m. would be perfect. OK. Yeah, I'll email him and see if 9 a.m. would work. and then I'll just have to get off in time for the 9.30 training. I'll be fine. All right. Yeah, I'll keep you in the loop on that. Yeah, like it's literally going to take two seconds. Because like when I put in his email address, it says this email provider partners with Google. I can either continue with Google or I have to sign in with a code. Oh, okay. I see. All right. Yep, I'll just CC you on the email inviting him to a 9 a.m. kind of quick call. All right. Sounds good. All right. Thanks. Thanks, Gary.",
