    "text": " Thank you, technology. This is Eric. How are you? Yeah, this is Patricia Capanna. I was having trouble with PCR capture, and someone sent me an email saying uninstall it and reinstall it. Well, I uninstalled it, and now I can't reinstall it. Okay, yeah, that was me. I just replied back to your email. so that initial link I sent you just click on that it'll take you right to the installation page and then you'll hit add to Chrome okay that's what I didn't know because it said it's going to change my website if I added to it so I I did add it now it says removed from Chrome but I don't see it anywhere I don't know where to go it's already added I finally clicked it because I couldn't get ahold of it I didn't know what to do so I added it but it doesn't show up anywhere. So now I don't have that little corner up on my... Yeah, the next step would be to sign into the tool. So you would go to the top right of your browser. There'll be a white puzzle piece icon. Click on that. Wait a minute. Oh, way up at the top. Yeah. I've got one, two, three, five things. I don't know what it is. That's Dropbox. then I've got PCR with a C on it. Is that what I do? No, it'll, it'll be in your browser. Um, so are you using Google Chrome? Yeah. So, um, it's like a little white puzzle piece. Yeah. If you click on it, it'll show you your extensions in a list. You just want to pin the capture tool with the pin icon. Okay. There it is now. So am I, am I logged in then to it? If you click on the capture extension logo next to the puzzle piece, it'll either ask you for a PCR web address or if you're already signed in, it'll list a bunch of websites with toggles. OK. Oh, see, it does nothing. I click it and oh, there we go. Finally to PCR recruiter dot net. I got to log in again or what? This is my I'm already logged in the PCR. I don't get it. Enter your PCR site. I just take them forever. I can't get it to click to log in. Oh, so there's, yeah, if it just says my company, that's placeholder text. You'll have to actually replace that with your real web address for your company's login page. Oh, let me see where I go back there for that. No, dang it. I lost it. Oh, where, I need to start. All right. PCR. Yeah, no problem. Okay. Yeah, just open up PCR, copy the web address. All right. And then it's like the username again. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. So you're logged in on the PCR website, but we're just logging you into the PCR extension now so we can connect you with the extension to the right database and username. All right. Let's see. Incorrect username. Oh, great. Did you select a database from the dropdown in that third slot? Yep. MRI Madison, Maine. That's my main database. Incorrect username. My username is PAC. Okay. So it must be a password. I, I, I, incorrect username. Shit. Oh, God. Is it case sensitive? The password is case sensitive, yeah. Okay, there. I'm in. So what do I do with all these capture and matches? Because I have so much trouble with PC capture. It keeps creating new companies, duplicate names. What am I doing wrong? Should I be under match or capture? So what you're looking at now is just a menu. It's the capture menu. So nothing in there really needs to be changed except for when you initially opened the ticket today, it was about everybody was going to your default company. So there is a toggle at the bottom right that says capture to default company. You might want to turn that off so people aren't automatically... Okay, good. It's off. Basic mode and dark mode are both off. And then what is the match? Match, that's just letting you know what websites the capture match feature works on. The match feature is just a little icon that'll appear to the right of somebody's name to let you know that they might already be in your database when you're looking through LinkedIn. So this can work then now? Like if I go to... Yeah. Yeah. Close that menu at the top right and then go to LinkedIn. And there are some steps that you can take to make sure that a duplicate isn't created. So maybe pull up somebody on LinkedIn that you think already exists in your database. All right. That's me. I'm already existing. Awesome. So you'll see it says click to update on the right instead of click to add. No, it says click to add. It says click to add. It doesn't say click to update. I got the link right out of my database. Oh, gotcha. Okay. So if you click on that, what do you see on the PCR capture tool? Hold on. It takes forever. Okay. I see search possible matches. Select duplicate to update merge. Use default company is off. I mean, I see my name there. That's a possible match. Okay. But it doesn't ask me to match or, I mean, it didn't. So, what? So, if I click that, it says use Patricia's company is off and use default company is off. Okay, yeah, so what you're looking at is the duplicate checking screen in the capture tool. Up top, it's listing different records in your database already that might be a match. So you would just click on the record that you want to update. So you would click on your name and a little number one will appear on the right letting you know, yes, this is the record I am trying to update in my database. below if there's a matching company you can select it with a little check box if there isn't you can use any of those toggle so what company are you listed at on your LinkedIn profile what's your company on LinkedIn? do you have a Kapanah international as a company in your database already? yes. is it spelled exactly the same way that it's spelled on LinkedIn? Let me go back. It looks like it is. Capana International Inc. Yep. It's Capana International Inc., formerly founder and president of Management Recruiters of Madison. So Capana International Inc. is the company. So when I click on that, it doesn't take me to the company. Okay. Why not? If you're still on the capture tool on the bottom half there should be some searching options to look for a specific company in your database okay I'm going to have to go back into it again because it went away so I have to click to add okay okay possible matches there I'm letting you good then down below it might say search where you can use a dropdown on the left to choose a field name like company name. Yep. And then on the right, type in what you think the company is in your database that you're going to search for. I mean, I don't have to put the whole name in there. Okay, now it comes up, but why doesn't it automatically put me in there? Because I already was in there. so if it's spelled any differently on LinkedIn like there's a period in it or it says int instead of international or there's any differentiation at all then PCR won't be able to find that company in your database as a possible match because I have all caps I have on my LinkedIn Capana International Inc and then parentheses formerly founder and president of Management Recruiters of Madison, but Capana International Inc. comes up now in the database when I click that. See, it's just creating so many duplicates. We're just so disappointed. Why can't I use Patricia's company? What does that do? So that toggle, when you turn it on, it will look at what company the name record is already associated with and keep that person there as you update them. Yeah, so you could toggle that on. What's a default company? That's where all my candidates were going. Yeah, your default company. Exactly. It's a candidate pool. You should only have one in your database. And since every name record in your database has to be at some kind of company, we use something called the default company as a catch-all. So if they don't have any company to go under, they go under your single default company. So a lot of people do set their capture tool to bring people to that default company, but you definitely don't have to. You can always just capture the company that's listed on the LinkedIn profile. Okay. When it puts my name in, it says Patricia CSM because it's Patricia Copan CSM. so what happens is it changes everything in my database i mean i've had so many times it changes the company and then it's like where did my company go i just don't get what's going on here yeah i think it mostly has to do with that first page you're seeing during the capture process you just got to make sure you're selecting the right company that's already in your database so that it doesn't create a new one. There's a video I sent in one of the emails. I just sent it again. I looked at it. Yeah, I looked at it. It didn't do anything. It didn't say anything that I didn't already know. It'll definitely walk you through the capture, the duplicate checking process. It'll walk all the different scenarios on how you would check for duplicates instead of creating duplicates with the capture tool. Because yesterday I kept downloading this guy because I couldn't find him after I downloaded him, and they had changed him to some other company, and they put something weird as his last name, and I'm like, what the heck? I don't know what's going on. I'm not sure with that specific example. Let's see. So was the last name something like a three-letter acronym, like you said CSM was coming up? Okay. So, yeah, the capture tool does have trouble with the last names when you have the extra words at the end of those abbreviations. So in that case, you can, during the update process, say, I want to keep what's already in my database. I don't want to update the last name just by clicking on the LinkedIn logo to the right of the last name field. That's used a lot during updating, just saying, keep what's in my database for this field and then maybe update the field below it or update the field below that. You can go on a field by field basis and decide what things do I actually want to update or what things do I want to keep? This is so weird. Okay. Yeah. And I'm not even showing up under Kapana International until I go to the company called Kapana International and I look at the people and then I'm there. But I'm not, I mean, when I click, when I go to Patricia Kapana and I click the company box, you know, down there, I get my name and Armand's name and that's pretty much it. I don't get the company, so it makes no sense. Are you in TCR right now and looking under the name tab on the company record? Yeah. Okay, so yeah. My company record is Capana International, Inc. But then in LinkedIn, it's Capana International, Inc., formerly founder and president. But when I click on that, I only get my name like it doesn't go to the company. So I'm not quite sure why. It's got to be a LinkedIn thing, maybe. Oh, I see. Yeah. In LinkedIn. So and that and what you just mentioned is probably why the company isn't listed as a possible duplicate when you're first capturing, because it does have everything in the parentheses there. It's notated differently between LinkedIn and what's already in your database. So that's where the searching feature comes into play, where you search for the correctly named company in your database and say, this is the company I want to put them in. Or, like you said before, you can toggle on that little toggle that said use Patricia's company so that they just stay where they are in your database and don't move to a different company. Oh, God. OK. Oh, OK. Yeah, play around with it. Maybe review that video one more time. It really does go through each and every scenario using the tool and making sure that duplicates aren't made. And if you do have more questions that come up or get stuck on anything, definitely let us know. I'll give you a call. Okay. Well, thanks for your help. I appreciate it. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. Thank you too. Bye.",
