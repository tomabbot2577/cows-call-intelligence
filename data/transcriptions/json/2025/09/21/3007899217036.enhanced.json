    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. I'm calling back in for the second time. I had to get off initially. Were you the first person I was talking to or probably not? I imagine. I don't believe so. Okay. So I'm new to the company, old to the business, new to the company, and this software, PC Recruiter, I had a spreadsheet with instructions. And so I did download everything, but my Java was out of date. So I updated that with the birth support person I talked to. And so now what I want to accomplish is I want to make certain that I have PCR, Java, and Launcher downloaded correctly and PCR captured. So that's what I need, and probably we need to share it for you to do that. Yeah, not a problem. Let me start up a meeting here. Then I will email you a link to join the call. What is a good email address for you? that's Connie with a capital C my capital C O-N-N-I-E at Alexander with a capital A-A-L-E-X-A-N-B-E-R Raymond with a capital R-A-Y-M-O-N-D dot com so Connie at Alexander Raymond dot com and the A and the R, those two names are uppercase, and the C on Connie is uppercase. All right. All right, I just sent the link on over to you. You should get it here in just a second. I'm looking to leave. How many emails? Three companies are on. This is the one that I work for. Just let me make sure I get on the right Gmail. I've got three Gmail accounts. I'm not kidding you. Let me open this. Here we go. We've got your meeting link. Oh, this is, never mind, this is coming in from somebody else. Pardon me. Urine central. Yep. Okay, that's what threw me for a loop. In my head, I'm thinking PC recruiter. Okay. yeah we just use the spring central video meetings and there you are i'll hit admit all right and if it asks you about uh connecting to audio you don't need to okay if you don't want to just you know what's on here yep i snap i'm quick i'm quick to throw a mouse around, you know, and that's not good. So can you see this PC Google Workspace marketplace that I mentioned? So you need to share the screen first in the video meeting. So at the bottom of the meeting window, you'll see a blue box with an arrow that says share. Should be sharing that now. So go ahead and click the stop share. You're going to want to share your entire screen, not just that workspace. That way I can check to see if you have the right programs downloaded. Otherwise, it just shows me that one screen. So it's got Chrome tab, but now shares right out. So up at the top, do you see where it says entire screen? Yes. So click on entire screen. And then you'll pick which screen you want to share. It should highlight it after you click it, and then you'll hit share again. Perfect. All right. Let me show you this spreadsheet. You may not need it, but you might. This spreadsheet where you can see PCR, a.k.a. PC Recruiter. There's a tech support I called in on. Download and install PCR, Java, and Launcher in all three of these. So I do believe that I've done that. And when we had to pull up Java, the first call I made, we had to update the Java. So that's been done. All right. So with the next one, you should be able to just click that launcher link. Yep. And then go ahead and click on where it says the PC Recruiter Launcher. Yep. you'll see it's running up there. Then go ahead and click on that. And you might see something pop up asking if it's okay to make changes. You'll just hit yes. I'm going to shut Adobe down because it's making it confusing. Let me try this again. Redirecting me. I'm saying Adobe could not open PC Recruiter Launcher because it is either not a supported file, blah, blah, blah. Okay, click on the top. Click the Downloads button again. And right-click on the DMG file. No, let's see. We're going to try and go somewhere else real quick. Go ahead and open up a new tab. Just like a new Chrome tab. Okay. Then did you receive your PCR login link yet? Yeah, I have them here. There's my... So click on that one that's the website. This one? Yep. Then in the bottom left-hand corner, you'll see where it says Launcher Install. Click on the one for Windows. When that's done downloading... Should I just get rid of PC Recruiter up here where you see my mouse? Yeah, you can get rid of that one for now. This is a redirect. I need to get rid of that too. Correct? Yep. All right. Go ahead and go to your downloads. Yep. There you go. Click on that. then you'll hit allow or yes whichever one it says i'm accepting the terms i'll move it over typical or custom uh typical See, I never got this far. Finish. All right, so that part's done. The next one we're going to do is you're going to see that little puzzle piece in the top right-hand corner of Chrome. Yep, right there. Go ahead and click there. put a little pin next to where it says PCR capture. Click that little pin next to it. And then you'll see where it says that www2pcrecruiter.net that whole big web address over to the left. Copy that entire thing. Then click on that puzzle piece again. Or not the puzzle sorry, the PC Recruiter logo, the little one that we pinned. All right. Yep. So go ahead and paste in what we just copied and hit log in. And now we're going to put in your PC Recruiter username. I better go back to the sheet. You might want to copy the password while we're here. Yep, go ahead and hit log in again. Then you'll select your database from the dropdown, which I believe is Connective Services. Then hit Log In. Beautiful. And then you can click the little X. yep we're going to go back to your pc recruiter page like the actual tab that we had with the pc recruiter login page for the website right here yep and then go ahead and select that database from the drop down the connective services go ahead and put in your username it'll automatically capitalize itself. Go ahead and paste in your password again there. Then hit login. You'll check that little box that says always allow and then open control loader. then you'll hit allow and this is just the launcher updating itself to the most recent version. I knew I was out of my wheelhouse. I'm like, this is getting complicated. I thought I did good to try to get some of the baseline stuff loaded. Yeah, it can be a little tricky. But this is the last part we got to do. Because then you'll have the Java launcher and capture all good. Yeah, it's on a spreadsheet. And the complication comes in the parent company. I have a Gmail account and a platform. The subsidiary who I actually work for has another Gmail account and a password. And so I'm just tipping the iceberg here. There's lots of other software out here. A lot of it's Google-driven, hence the spreadsheets and all that is Google-driven. I know some about Google, but I've been using different softwares. And so this is day two for me. So we're still trying to get me logged in. And I just a few minutes ago was able to get text on the RingCentral. Oh, there you go. Yeah, so right now you are all good. Yeah, you can click that and then hit the skip. Yeah, so you're logged into the database. Your capture tool is logged in. Okay. And you got Java on the launcher. So what is this? It's got one. So if you click on the one itself, it's just a notification. Correct. Yeah. Yep, if you want to allow browser notifications. Okay, okay. Question is, are there videos to watch regarding the system? Yeah, so if you go to the little gear icon next to the little profile picture over on the right. Yep, here comes my boss. He interrupted the last call, but I'll let you go. I'm going to answer his call. Thank you very much for your help. Yep, no problem. Have a great day. Thank you. Hey, Kevin. Hey, are you ready to play for a minute? Yeah, what's great?",
