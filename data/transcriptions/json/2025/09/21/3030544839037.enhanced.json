    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I need to get some technical support. My PC recruiter email is not working properly. Okay. We can take a look at that. Are you with the GBR Smith Group? That's correct, yes. Okay. Let me open up your database here. What's your username in PCR? PCR, just a second. Let me just move that. I think it's GBR Smith. Oh, yeah. That came up here as one of the options. So let me do that. GBR Smith. And then I will check your email connection here. And I have a password, too, for PCR login if you need that. No, that's all right. I just need the... And I can read the error message here if you want me to read that. Okay, yeah, I just did the testing, and it says domain spoofing prohibited 551. Let me check on that. Domain spoofing, yeah, this just says PC recruiter could not connect to your outgoing email server. Right. So if you go to system in the main menu, kind of at the top center, or wait, actually, on your view, you would probably have to click the three horizontal lines at the top center to see more options in the main menu. I see. Oh, go ahead. I was trying to send an email message, and that's where I got the error message. In the upper right-hand corner, there's three horizontal dots. Is that what you're referring to? Where it says settings? It would be kind of in the main menu of PCR up at the top by the PCR logo at the far top left. Okay. So, yeah, if you're on the main PCR screen and you have your main menu, things like MyPCR, company position up at the top there. There should be three horizontal lines at the end of that main menu so that you can get to the system menu option. Right. So I just clicked on PC Recruiter. It's got my login. I'm at the login page. Okay, yeah. log into PCR and let me know when you're viewing the main PCR page. So log in. So, what I'm looking at now is PCR. left-hand corner it just says you know my PCR right click on your company company or the person role as name yeah in that main menu on the far right is three horizontal lines yeah next to schedule click on that it'll give you more main menu options and you want system once like that one it's on the right okay yes I have system there it is perfect and let's see on the left scroll down to you see email setup about the sixth or seventh option down okay click on that yep email setup and then on the right click on email alias list email alias list got it and then in the bottom frame click on the pencil icon next to your email alias okay this is loading and then it has this edit edit alias and it's got my email got my address in her dress and so in that server okay okay yeah it looks like yeah that server is missing a port number possibly so who's your provider says very oh let me look up very very SMP settings let's see I did hit I've I was trying to think what might have caused this. I'm having, redoing my website, and I've allowed, but the guy that's the company, the individual who's redoing the website, I allowed him to enter Vario. I gave him my Vario login name and password. Could that have caused, could that possibly have caused this? maybe if you changed with the password changed at all that would have to be readjusted okay yeah I don't know I am not sure okay so yeah it looks like George at GBO Smith comm SMT p.vario calm and with SSL they want the port number to be 465, so let me adjust that. Let's try this. Let's have you, do you know your password for your email address? Oh, the one they're asking for here, the SMTP password? Yeah, that would just be your email address password when you're going to Vario to open up your inbox or to access your email whatever password you enter there would be your SMTP password I would maybe just try re-entering that okay I would have the Vario yeah I have the Vario password name and password. I would try re-entering that Vario password into the SMTP password field here. Because the SMTP password is a long, it must be 15, it's disguised of course. Can I change that then you're saying that SMTP password? Yeah, you could backspace that and just re-enter your Vario email password there. Okay. Let me do that right now. So I've got a Vario login name, G-B-R-S-M-I, and then I've got a password. Let me try that. um so if let me think here so the vario if your login isn't an email address um then that might not be the right username and password we need at vario whatever your um email address and then the password associated with that email address should be entered here. You could try, maybe Vario just lets you put in a username rather than an email, and then the password will be the same either way. We could try that. So should I try this? I've got a Vario username, G-B-R-S-M-I. Should I try that? Don't change the username where it says SMTP username. Keep that as your email address on this screen. But the SMTP password, do you have a password associated with Vario? Yes. Yeah, I do. Okay. I would try putting in that password there. What might have caused this, do you think? I'm not sure. Just sometimes your email alias needs to be connected from PCR to your email provider again if the connection is lost. But yeah, the first troubleshooting step is to see the password, make sure it's correct. I just clicked in the password and I clicked save. And then I'm getting prompted. It says, do you want to save your password in the upper right hand? Say no to that. Pardon? Say no to that. You don't want that saved up at the top right, I don't think, into your browser. Okay. Disconnection here. Okay. So this is giving a – when I test the connection now, it's saying incorrect authentication data. Okay. So it might be a different password than that. Do you have any other passwords that you know of associated with Vario? No. Not that I know of. Well, there's a Vario webmail password that goes way back to, yeah, that was like 20 years ago when I first joined PCR. That's the one. Vario Webmail. And that was, you probably, if you were around that time, yeah, it was, yeah, $3, K-P-W-T-6-5, you know, kind of stuff. So go back and use that. Yeah, use that one instead in the SMTP password field. I think that will be the right one. Okay. I've got to go back now, I guess. I'm back to where it says alias address list, GBR Smith. Do I click email? What do I click? Email alias list? Email alias list. Yep, up at the top, email alias list. And then in the bottom frame, just click on the little pencil next to your email alias to edit. Okay, here we are. And I'm back to, let me change that SMTP password to this one I just said. It was very a webmail password. $3 on KPW. $3 on KPW. $3 on KPW. $2.65A. $2.65. and then do i save that at the bottom yeah uh hit save and then i'll um refresh on my end and test the connection i just saved it all right let me refresh Okay, so this is still saying 535 incorrect authentication data. Okay, let's see. Let Let me try entering a port number, 465. No, still giving an issue there. So let's do this. Let's try opening up your webmail. And actually, we can jump on a screen share so we can both take a look at the same time at your screen. Okay. So let's, in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, where would I find that? So at the top of your browser, you can hit a plus sign to open an additional tab. It would be kind of at the top, maybe the top center, if you have a browser tab already open. Yeah, top right, it says new tab with a plus sign. Yep, click on that. And then in the web address field, you want to put in a new web address, and that's going to be meetings.ringcentral.com. So I've got a blank horizontal space with a – it's kind of a search symbol there, like a magnifying glass. Is that where I type that in? um it would be kind of at the top of your screen where you put in like a www.web address um okay it's yeah so up there um this is the web address you want to put in it'll be meetings.ringcentral.com dot r-i-n-g e-r-a-l-c-o-m So I've got meetings.ringcentral.com Do I need a www? No www necessary. Yeah, no www. Just hit enter on your keyboard and it'll take you to that website. Okay, this is join a meeting. Perfect. Let me give you a meeting ID. Okay. Okay. So that will be 984. 984. 205. 205. 680. 680. Oops. So 984-205-680. Perfect. Yep. And then join? Join, yep. And then it might ask you for your name. You could enter your name there if you want. So it's just asking me about cookies. I guess, do I just allow all cookies? Sure, yeah, you can allow that. And I see you joined the meeting. Perfect. Yeah, what else? Does it have another pop-up? Well, it just says this is report issue. I have to join audio. It says you can continue. with audio or you can join by computer? You could say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. We won't need the audio from the screen. Okay. So I've got George and then GK Garrett. Perfect. Yep. Excellent. So then down at the bottom, there's a blue share button. Click on that. Got it. And then up towards the top, it'll let you choose your entire screen, it'll say. Okay. And then just click on screen one to highlight it and select it. And then at the bottom, right hit share. And it's loading now on my end. Excellent. I can see your screen very cool all right so you can close that pop-up that appeared that has ring central and that guy smiling you just at the top right hit the X to close that pop-up a little bit further to the left it's yes if you go straight up there or here let me I can actually do the remote control If you get a pop-up asking to allow remote control, say yes to that. Control. Perfect, yeah. And then I can kind of use your mouse a little bit here. Let's see if this works. Okay. Take that. I'll just close that. All right. And then we'll open a new tab. And up here in the web address where the cursor is blinking, go ahead and enter however you get to your Vario webmail. So it might be at Vario.com. It's something I very rarely use. Just type in Vario.com. I believe that would take you to the right place yet. Or if you have a bookmark or however you'd normally get to your Vario webmail. Very rarely used. So I just got Vario login here. Okay. And then got username and password. Password is already shown in there. So let's do login. There is a different area for the webmail. we'll see if that this one yeah there's I need to go back or is this oh yeah try heading back at the top left there and we'll see if we have a different way to get to the webmail oh yeah so across the top it says control panel or webmail Click on the webmail tab. Got it. Okay. And then let's see if we can log in there. Yeah. Hit log in. Okay. So here, yeah, it looks like you need to enter an email address rather than that password. Yeah. Yeah. So there's my George at gbrsmith.com. Okay. And then we're hoping that we can get that. There's no way to view that password. Okay. Let's see if that even works. Go ahead and log into Webmail and see if it gets you through. Okay. Password mismatch. So I've got to get a password for logging. Well, I've got a Vario Webmail password. Should I try that? Yeah, you could try entering that in. Yep. Okay, let me just do this. Okay, let's see if this works. So it doesn't like it. I think that might be what the issue is on PCR. Try hitting, yeah, forgot password. Hopefully that'll work. So I guess I want to update the password, right? Right. Okay, so it says to change your email account settings, please log into the control panel first. You may update your settings by clicking on Mail Central in the email section of your control panel. Okay, I'll remember that. Mail Central email section. So in green there, it says control panel in green, kind of in that message underlined. Just click on that. It'll take you to the right place. There we go. And hit log in down below. and we know we have the password correct for the control panel so that's good okay and then down at the bottom hit got it in the blue there okay and then okay so we want to find it called the email area yeah let me see if I do I still have the the mouse controls this yeah okay oh no I got it now okay awesome all right so email let's see standard now management and the grab my coffee second okay Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I'm back. All right. So on the screen there, it's giving you a prompt to put in a new password for George at GBRSmith.com. Okay. So go ahead and create a new one. This is a new Vario webmail password. Vario webmail, exactly. Okay. New password. And then confirm password. Let me write this down. Yep. Oops. I just lost it. Here, I'll get you back there one second here. Settings. Change password. Go ahead and put it in that confirm password area. And then change password. Okay. Okay. and then up at the top right where it says save your password where it says username enter your email address there uh up in the upper right yeah the cursor's there now so you could just start typing your email address george at gbrsmith.com okay the cursor Sir, the GK is blocking out. Are we looking to the right of my email address, George at GBR Smith? Yeah, there's a pop-up window that says save your password question mark at the top right. Are you seeing that or is it hidden by the RingCentral stuff? It's hidden by the GK rectangle. All right. Let me see if I can enter it in here. Yep, it's working for me. One second. George at drsniff.com. Save. Okay. So now if we go back to this. and go ahead and enter in your new password that you just made okay all right and then save go ahead and save and make sure and just look at it real quick And save it again. Perfect. All right. And then I'm just going to grab your mouse again real quick here, and we'll do a test connection on that. So get the pencil, hit test connection down below. Remains spoofing prohibited. What is the word spoofing? You know, I know what it means in like common language, but does it imply that somebody got in and messed with it? So usually it'll say domain spoofing related to emails when your email address doesn't match the one you're actually sending from. That's the most common, but that's not the case here. You are using your correct email address. It might be that certain settings related to your domain need set up. Things like the, they're just a bunch of acronyms, honestly, where it's, I think, DKIM, SPF. These are all related to your domain name, the gbrsmith.com. If they don't have certain things set up correctly, then the email addresses are going to look like they're spoofing, basically look like they're not associated with the correct website, GBRSmith.com. So I can let me write down the three acronyms. And if you said you did have somebody kind of working on your website for you. Yeah, I've hired a website consultant to negate the Niverio login information. Okay, so I'm going to send you an email here. Well, actually, here, let me look it up and maybe write it down in case you're having trouble getting email. here are the three acronyms there they are okay so yeah just talk to that web developer consultant and ask if they can check to make sure that you have SPF set up correctly which is S as in Sam P as in purple and F as in Frank? SPS? Oh, F as in Frank. Got it. Yeah. So SPF, make sure that that's set up correctly, as well as DKIM. So D as in dog, K as in I guess kilo. That's probably the phonetic alphabet. K as in kilo. I as in India, M as in Mike. So D, K, I, M. D as in dog, A as in kitchen, I, and then M as in Mary, D, K, I, M. Exactly. So yeah, S, P, F, D, K, I, M. And the final one is called D, M, A, R, C. So that's D as in dog, M as in Mary, A as in Elsa, R as in Romeo, and C as in Charlie. D mark. So, yeah, those three settings are set up, you know, as the website's being built or adjusted. As long as those are double-checked and working, I think that's what your email setup needs so that it doesn't think it's spoofing. Okay. Let's do one more change here. I'm going to jump over to your incoming mail, and we're going to input that password one more time since it was changed so that your incoming mail will match up. Mail servers, this one here. Edit this one. And get rid of the old password. And there you go. Yeah, go ahead and enter that new password one more time here and hit save. Save. Okay. Perfect. And while that screen's still up, we'll just go to test connection to the left of that. That has green lettering. Excellent. Okay. So the incoming mail is still working. It's just that outgoing mail, which leads me to believe it's one of those three acronyms I gave you needs to be adjusted over on your website. So if that doesn't work, if you've checked with your consultant and they've made sure all three of those things are set up correctly, definitely call back in. We'll continue to troubleshoot. I think that's what's going to fix it for you. Okay. So I need to call this web developer then. And then these three acronyms, what exactly, how should I refer to those then? So those are domain settings. and if they're set correctly, your email address will match your domain again. They're kind of mismatched in a way without those settings. And it's, yeah, so with that, it's affecting your ability to send emails because those settings aren't. Yeah, we just literally did capture that. Everything was working fine, and then all of a sudden I could not send an email. So next step, I need to contact this web developer then, right? Yes. Okay. Absolutely. All right. Yeah, and like I said, give us a call back if there's still trouble after those are set up correctly on the domain side. All right. All right, Garrett, I appreciate your help. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else in the meantime. So if I need to continue to have trouble today, you'll be around today? Yeah. Yeah, if you talk to them and they've kind of adjusted those settings, just call back in. I'll be around today for sure. Yeah, do you have the correct dial number, or should I just dial into that main helpline number? Yeah, just dial into the main helpline number, and you can ask for Garrett. and you should be good there. Okay. All right. Thank you for your help. Hopefully we can get this working here. Awesome. Sounds great. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",
