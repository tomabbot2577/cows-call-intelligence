    "text": " Hello, Robin. Hello, how are you? I say hell to the N-O. That's going to be a failed edition. What are the idiots? No. You can't just like, and I tell people, like when you're adding users, if you add users, delete them, let us know so we can adjust your billing. You know, him failing to notice that he was, we're not going to refund anything. He hasn't even played his June invoice. And he's like net 30. So that's like really for services he had in June that he still hasn't even paid for. So we're certainly not going to skip that one and July and give a refund. Absolutely not. He isn't. He's ridiculous. When is he talking about like that he even like didn't have another person? He says, oh, I've been overcharged for many months. Now, can you find out how many months I was overcharged for? And I said, it's on you to let us know. And you didn't let us know. I said, I see it was suggested in June, but you didn't let us know. We don't know if you don't have anyone using. Well, I think I'm due a refund, or at the very least, I shouldn't have to pay anymore. So when he canceled, he wants to not pay for July. I told him, I said, well, I said, maybe we can waive the July since we know you're canceling. But I said, but they don't do refunds. Well, I want you to have them figure out and let me know. I'm like, okay, but we don't do refunds. So that was that. No, his July. No, he could do an early cancellation for July. I'll send a nice little email right now because I'm really tired of getting people being idiots. Oh, here. Is Patsy home with you? No, she's out shopping. Oh, good for her. Only for groceries. Oh, listen to this. Oh, wait here. I got to. Here, I'm going to send you. so I get this thing about you know like you follow up like hey you have an open invoice okay I get this response no I think it was to oh I think it was to actually I'm going to send it to you in text on cell phone like people like fucking suck and I'm going to just start being a bitch I'm going to start being a bitch because people suck listen to this so somebody got a thing and they wrote back fuck you she died or whatever okay literally she died on this date so i replied back with uh you'll see it in here thing you got to see what i replied back with i'm sorry to hear about patricia's passing that said your response was uncalled for we were simply doing our job by following up on an unpaid invoice and had no way of knowing the circumstances. Yeah. Okay? A straightforward explanation would have been entirely sufficient. Considering I, he told me, fuck you, I think my thing is clear, like, uncalled for. Okay? I get a reply back this morning, fuck off, cunt. Jeez. Wow, there's some anger there. Wow. Now, this email is coming from the person that apparently died. yeah so did the person even die i don't know you're accessing her email yeah but this is what i got so you know what f everybody you have an invoice you're paying it and i'm just gonna be a bitch about it because we're not paying us what do i care anyway right yeah that's off and i you know you're as old as almost as old as me that is a i think the kids these days they use that more like freely like it's not like such a bad word in my day that was like the worst thing you could ever call a girl like oh yeah i never used that word i actually can't believe i even repeated it did i even did i even say it or did i spell it out oh no you said it oh okay i don't even normally say it okay like i uh i don't even normally say it i can't even believe i actually said it out loud to you but that's what i got today that's how i started my morning people can be so nasty for no reason like just let us know oh i'm you know like really sad my whoever patricia was relation to the person replying through patricia's email um like just say that passed away what could we do about it i would have been so nice about it oh i'm so sorry but But say that to me. Oh, yeah. So here's I'm going to like I'm not going to delete the email yet because I want to save it. Like this is the kind of bullshit why I'm crabby. I can't believe that. I'm like, oh, my God. So I wanted to reply back like apparently I have a much happier life than you do. And I'm going to move on with it. Maybe you should go get some counseling. Yeah. That's uncalled for. Anchor directed it an innocent person. Yeah. I wrote it in a restaurant during my job and following up on an unpaid invoice and had no way of knowing the circumstances. So an explanation should have been entirely sufficient, you know. And then I get that back. Oh, like the first one was just an F you out of nowhere. No, you know, it was unreal. What is wrong with people? Yeah. How did that first one come in here? Patricia Morrison. Do I even still have it? Oh, we're just following up. Hope this message finds you well. Following up. Have a moment. Hope this, you know, hope you're having a great day. Wanted to know if you were going to process the invoice because the card on file was declined. I've been, like, sending several emails here, apparently. Oh, I think I do. I think the other one came into billing. Yeah, and this last one is FOP. Oh, here it was. It was a reply to an overdue invoice. They've been on hold. Reply is back F off. I replied back, sorry to hear about our payoffs. That said, I'm called for, and I got F off C-U-N-T. Wow. Unbelievable. So this guy, no. you could do an early cancellation with 80% off your last one as an early termination fee, but you still actually owe for your services in June. Yeah. He's like, well, and bless his heart, Josh wasn't really the most up to par on that. Like a lot of his, like these dimensional search, you wouldn't even get a phone number. So I'm like, got people that I can't even get a hold of. I'm like, you, you put them all in here and you send them a contract, you sign up, do you even get a phone number or this guy he he was like yeah I'm gonna cancel we never really used it and never really worked like just he never followed up with people he didn't always explain that you need to let us know to add users and just clean it up it's it's kind of like clean up Wilson messes a little bit it's like ah come on did you oh did that guy I hadn't even looked at the email I probably have gotten 75 emails I've got to do in the last three days and all this fucking AI trial like they're all reaching out coming in as inquiries just asking silly questions to me about the AI so I'm straight up support that's not all I've been doing we're not we're not doing training on it you could read on it you're getting it for free we're not doing training on it too for free And then I've had three or four or five cancellations. Art Amber, I didn't even read the email yet. What did he do? He's an odd one. He's been around for like 20 years. So him I'm a little bit more flexible with. He has basically been retired, and he doesn't really need the database. but there could be a possibility that he might get a call from a client and want to reactivate it so it's maybe better than a match in a cancellation but maybe like an on hold but i'm thinking an on hold for one user at 20 a month is you know what i mean maybe we offer an on hold for 10 a month i know they used to be smaller they used to be they used to be free so i say yeah absolutely A $10 a month, maybe we offer that. Yeah, I would offer $10 a month because that's a little bit more reasonable. Yeah, but we want something. And I could say, like, we normally charge $20, but since you've been a long-time customer, we'll do it for $10. That way, if you do need access to it, we don't have to go through a whole process of pulling up the, you know, just really just turning it back on, right? Easy to turn. Yeah, that's a great idea. Because at least it keeps something, and then if we needed it, he could just kick it back up, but it's only $10, not $20. I think that's a great idea. Okay, because he's been around a long time, and he's retired. And then when he does want to permanently cancel, then that's when, if he wants to get a data return. Because he's like, well, if I got a data return, I'm like, you won't be able to use it. You won't be able to work in it. Yeah. Now, should that go to you? Is there an on-hold agreement or whatever? I don't even know. there is there's an on hold agreement somewhere I don't know where it is but I don't know if that's in Panda let me see if he wants to move forward with that let me see I don't know if it is or not because I know that Nick was kind of redoing some of these things oh my god I swear to god these emails they just don't stop can I call you on myself for a second yeah okay i'll be on my side right back okay bye",
