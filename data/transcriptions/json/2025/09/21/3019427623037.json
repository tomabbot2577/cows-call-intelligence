    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you right now? Hey, so I'm using Apple for PCR, and I had problems when I first started using it. First to first was into this company about a week and a half ago, two weeks ago. And so when I click Login on Google Chrome, it just doesn't go. And I remember it was a simple fix last time, but I don't remember exactly what to do. Okay, cool. What's your name and what company are you with? So my I'm with my name is Chris and I'm with Starboard Consultants. Okay. My username would be CFP. I don't know if or you know what it would be. Morris County. Let me just send you my link. No, that's all right. I found I found the Starboard Consultants also mentioned Morris County in there, too. So, yeah, I think I'm on the right spot here in our files. Cool. So let's start by at least doing a clear cache. I'll give you instructions to do that. That may fix it. So if you go to the three dots at the top right of the browser, then look for more tools towards the bottom. Okay. And then developer tools. Okay. And that should open up some coding and stuff like that. You could just ignore all of that and then go up to your web address up at the top of the page and right-click on the refresh button, which is that arrow in a loop. Hold on. Oh, the refresh. Okay. Yeah, right-click on that. It should give you the option to empty cache and hard reload. Yeah, should I click it? Yeah, click on that. That'll slowly reload your page. and once the page does reload, you can close the developer tools. Okay, so once it all is all closed. Okay, let's see. So just reloaded. Oh, whoopsies. Hold on. Loading. Should I close it before I try logging in? Sure. Yep. Okay, let's see. Nope. Still nothing. Okay. I click login. Yeah, I click login and then just the little bubbles go up and then nothing. Let me try logging in as your username. So are you choosing a database from the dropdown at the top where it says consumer, industrial, industrial, industrial? And I've never seen industrial old. Oh, that is. Okay. That's probably just a backup they did. I just got yelled at by my boss. So, yeah, it's not industrial old. All right. I'm logged in as the admin, and that works. So let me try next to log in as your username. Yeah. And is that just Chris is your username? Username CFP. Chris represents Payload, so CFP. Okay, so I'm able to get into my end. So just something computer-specific. Let's see here. If you want to, we might want to just do a quick screen share, and then I can see your screen. So open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings.ring, R-I-N-G? Yep, meetings.ringcentral.com. Central, central. Oh my God, what's going on in central? Meetings.ringcentral.com. The site can't be reached. Oh, because I spelled meetings wrong. Oh, gotcha. Meetings. Meetings plural, right? Yeah, plural. Join a meeting. Excellent. And I'll give you an ID here. So the ID is 584-285-829. 584-285-829. Yep. Okay, join. Perfect. enter your name yeah it doesn't matter what you enter there it's all good Santa Claus I'm just kidding awesome if it asks about joining with audio yeah you can continue without audio since we're already on the phone allow while you're visiting a site allow while visiting that'll probably be for screen share yeah and then audio, continue without audio. Okay. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your screen that you want to share. Got it. I'd like to record this computer screen audio. Should I deny screen recording? No, I guess allow that so that it can, I think it calls it recording when you're trying to just share your screen. Okay. Wow. You can just click Google Chrome or do it on your own later. I'll do it later, whatever. Okay, that should work. Okay, Chrome tab. is what you to share with RingCentral Chrome tab window entire screen, right? Yeah, either one should work. Entire screen is probably best. You know what? I have to quit the browser and then go back. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine. I could just re-give you that meeting ID. That's totally fine. Okay, cool. So let me quit the browser. All right, hold on. Okay, let me quit. Opening it back up. And then I'm going to PC Recruiter. Log in, so I can't log in. So what was it again? The meetings, ringcentral.com, got it. And then the reading I did was? That is 584-285-829. 829. 584-285-829. Perfect. All right, now I'm back. Excellent. Continued without audio. All right, and try that blue share button again. Share entire screen. Entire screen. Share. Excellent. You know, it's interesting. I did do this the first day, too. So I'm wondering maybe Google Chrome had a update or if I had a version of Google Chrome open. Because I did have two Google Chromes as well. So maybe I'm wondering if that's what it was. Could be. So, yeah, if you just want to go to your login page in a new tab, possibly, on whichever browser you prefer. Okay, so login page in a new tab. Okay. There we go. When I click login, you see? It just loads. Okay. Yeah, maybe that's what this is. Maybe this is a – because I have two Googles. That could be it. I just realized that. Because I remember sometimes when I would, like, so say I would go and, let's see, say I go to an email and there's a link about content directly, Etsy, whatever, stupid. So if I go like this, open with, okay, so yeah, so now it only says one. Okay. So, yeah, so maybe that's what happened. Maybe they, yeah, I don't know. Try going to the three dots at the top right again. and then go to About, or Help, I'm sorry, towards the bottom, About Google Chrome, and that'll let you know if you have the latest version. Okay, that'll update. Let's see if that helps at all. Also, while that's updating, go to the three dots again at the top right of the browser and go to extensions and then manage extensions. And okay, those are all pretty normal. That's all right. Go ahead and close that tab. It won't be your extensions. Maybe it is the new, the Google Chrome. So let me say if my finder, if I have, what would it be under? Applications. It looks like you just have that one Google Chrome in there. Interesting. At least we'll be getting you the latest version of Chrome. Yeah, because I think maybe that's what it is, maybe. You're up to date. Relaunch. Oh, yeah, let's relaunch. It'll probably kick you out of the meeting, and it'll reopen all the tabs that you did have open. That'll be fine. Should reload those. Okay, we launch. Oh, what am I doing here? Capture, install. Okay, and then, so it's not sharing your screen anymore, but no, yeah, for some Okay, let's try again. If you just log in. Still not logged in yet. Remember last time the lady made me put a link in or something? That could have been for PCR capture. Yeah, I think it was for capture. Yeah, it was like made me put a link in. Something strange is going on with this. Let's see. Are you using, do you know if you're using a VPN to connect to the internet at all? I am using, no, I'm just using regular Wi-Fi. All right, that's, all right, not the issue then. Let's see if it works on my iPad. Let me try to, I'm going to whitelist your IP address. I could look up the login attempts there and maybe get your IP address that way. Yeah. oh so i get in through my ipad oh okay so it's something specific to the computer yeah which this is what happened when i first started as well i got into the ipad but this lady whoever i talked to she just was like she said for me to do something i remember it was so simple and i was like wow like that's interesting and then it worked also on um my Safari and Google Chrome. She did something. She was like, yeah, it was some kind of something. Let's see if this capture thing works still because I was having an issue with that when this first happened too. Let's see. I'm going to just go here. What do I do? I'll be in Recreate. Oh. Interesting. So I'm just looking at your, trying to find the IP address here. Okay, so it still works on adding, like, the capture. Okay. You know, so that's still there, you know. All right, mine is almost ready to go. I just had to look up a few things here. Okay, let's try this. So if you go back to your PCR login screen. Okay. And click on the little, it's like an icon with little toggles to the left of the www.webaddress there. Yeah, click on that and go to site settings at the bottom. and then go to delete data on the right and delete and then you can close this tab that you have open and we'll do the clear cache one more time so go to the three dots again at the top right go down to more tools developer tools and ignore all that that pops up and right click on the refresh button empty cache and hard reload and we'll see if that helps I'm gonna do that as well on my end just to see if I can recreate this okay well I just out database industrial user news if they know still nothing okay That is strange. Let me do your IP address. I'm having trouble running the steps for that. Here's my step-by-step guide. There we go. Okay, so I'll go to NSD admin. Try to find login attempts from the most recent IP. Maybe is it because I had it open like all night? I don't even know. And I automatically logged out. Even here, too, 600 minutes. This last activity is 7-17. So on my iPad, it's not working as well. Maybe is there like a system, like a thing that's going on with PCR? Not that I know of. And I'm able to log in on my computer as well under your username. There's something. OK, let's see. Here's your IP address. I just found it. So I'm going to put this into the whitelist of IP addresses. Maybe that'll help. Okay, cool. So I've added that. Go ahead and refresh the page and try again. See if that helps at all. No. Okay. It's got the latest Chrome, no strange extensions, you're not on VPN. Deleted site data, deleted cache. Do you have any web protection software running at all? Like a virus scanning? I wish I could remember what we did last time. Something like what her name was, too. Let's see if it's in this email. So it's probably Robin is the only female. Robin. Yeah. It was Robin. She did it in like two seconds. She was like, oh, this is all you have to do. And I forget for some reason. I mean, because it was I've learned so much since then, like through this job. So it's like, it just is not in my brain anymore. Sure. Okay. Let's see if I'm going to just chat with our support team and see if somebody is available to take a look. It was for sure. Robin. And for some reason, I feel like she, it was something with. I was something with the. the link or something. I don't even know what it was. Because I already have the launcher installed on my Mac. Okay. That's good. All right. Save launcher. If you go up to the web address and take off the ampersand over to the right, So ampersand style sheet equals default. Just remove that part of it. See if that helps at all. Yeah. No. Okay. I wonder if it had to do with having Google Chrome because I had two of them and then like quitting the one maybe. I have no idea. I don't see people. Those are animations. Moments. What are you watching? All right. Somebody is typing now. Hopefully they have a suggestion for me. Yeah. Now, is PCR the only one you work for, or do they outsource you? Just PCR, yeah. Yeah, so have you noticed how a lot of AI – I see this. That was actually another question I had for you. I sent it to my boss, the AI, like this right here. Okay, yeah, the AI suite. Yeah, I'm wondering if we should get into that. How do I get into that? So we've currently put a free trial on all the AI. And so everybody has it available, except for AI search. We'll need your PCR contract signer to request it, just because we have to check to make sure that your database has the latest search engine built into it. But the, yeah. Oh, go ahead. So I'm saying you can do search. That's pretty cool. Yeah. So let me see. Who's your contract signer? Ernie. Ernie. Okay. Yeah. If he just wants to shoot a email to us at support at main sequence dot net that he wants the AI search turned on, we can add that to the free trial for you guys to play around with. So it's support at main sequence dot net. And then what would he write in that email? Yeah, just something like requesting AI search. And we'll add it to the free trial. Okay, actually, I've got Robin messaging me back. She says, could the network have restarted the computer or even restarted router if it's an issue? I'm not sure if it would be router since you're able to get in on your iPad but it does seem to be I'm going to go back into my iPad right now are you ready? PCRecruiter.net hold on okay let's see oops here. Oh, now it's not working. Hold on one second. Where is my PCRecruiter.net? Hold on, I'm just getting blank. Let me just copy it from here, actually. Copy. Paste. okay so I'm going to go on my iPad use password boom I should log in again yeah so I'm in again on my iPad not the router okay maybe try restarting this computer it seems to be just before I called you do that again okay let's see yeah I guess just try it one more time okay oops Should I do shutdown? Or wait, I just got one more suggestion in. So go to the three dots at the top right and go to new incognito window and see if that matters at all. And then go to your PCR web address there. Okay, yeah. and then Safari I guess have we tried that I forget no that's nice it doesn't even loading there. That green bar at the top usually means it's just like halfway loaded. Try maybe hitting refresh again. Okay. Yeah, I don't think Safari works. It's not one of our supported browsers, so that's probably not... You know, it worked for me up until this moment in Safari as well. Okay. Maybe should I update my computer? Should I update this or? I am not sure. I think we'll take about 20 minutes I would maybe give a restart first at the top right where you have a checkbox or a green checkmark what program is that? serve to earn maybe try closing that that one looks a little strange if you can right click oh is there a way to close that how do I close that yeah I haven't heard of that hmm do I find her Surf to... Move to trash, maybe? I don't think so. We'd probably have to uninstall it. Is there like a... Yeah, so I'm trying to think. Where would it be? new terminal at folder, new terminal tab at folder, show in enclosing folder, show package contents. Okay, I got another suggestion here that keep coming in luckily. So it says go to system settings on your Mac. Okay. System settings, and we're looking for network. Maybe somewhere on the left there. There we go, network, and then Wi-Fi connected, filters, active. It wasn't real tech. Go to the filters, the second one listed. I'm not sure what those are. Transparency proxy. Okay, disable that. Oh, so it is a VPN. The Surf to Earn, I think, is a VPN. That's strange. Okay, so that's disabled. Go ahead and close that, and then we'll try again. Logging in. Yeah. Okay. There we go. Okay. It was that Surf to Earn thing. I don't know. I would work on trying to get that completely uninstalled from your computer somehow. I'm not exactly sure. what its function is, but it was definitely messing you up. Okay. Okay, let me actually just look it up, because what is surf to earn? Oh, oh, oh. Earning rewards often points resemble what the hell is this? in launchpad locate the app click and hold that okay wait what is that you're you still on here with me yeah okay so what does this mean let's see how to install programs you can't delete what is the money this is so if i go to where even is launchpad I'm not sure I'm not too familiar with max specifically I think launchpad might be one word I think launchpad is just the finder that's what I thought it was okay let's see what if I just delete it it. Sublocation is a hosting system. Boom. Okay, good. Yeah, you're gone. Awesome. Okay, cool. And this is you. What is this? App survey junkie. It just pops up whenever you uninstall Surfer and probably I was kidding. No. I wonder how that came you know what I did last night I was playing around with an AI with with the chat GPT and I think I was trying yeah I don't know I don't know if maybe that had something to do with it because I was playing around with the terminal too like yeah I'm not sure and like come come with max or I don't know but um well we're all good now so now we're on I bet you it works for safari too let's say possibly Safari usually is not like a supported browser we always recommend Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge but sometimes you can make a lot of the stuff work in Safari sometimes you can't no I mean I've used it in Safari for sure but yeah for some reason it doesn't work what if I could use no right I don't know how to get this yeah no I don't know why I did that but anyway all right cool so now it works so I'm all good um all right yeah I think that's all good now yeah just reach out if anything like that happens again or if any other questions come up video action all right cool all right awesome you enjoy the rest of your day thank you for helping me out you too have a good one",
