    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Bob Levitt with Brandon Becker. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Good. Question. I'm having a problem after I click the capture tool. The icon is wiggling, but nothing is happening. So what I did is I went into the capture tool. I logged out of it and I logged back in it and still nothing's happening. Oh, okay. If you go to the top right where the capture tool icon is, top right of your screen, double check that the basic mode is turned off and to the left. Okay, hold on. Then it's turned on. Basic, all of them are turned to the left. Okay, that's good. So it's not the basic mode. Let's see. Let's see. Let's actually get a screen share. I could probably come up with that way. Is it RingCentral or FastSupport? Yeah, RingCentral. OK, hold on one second. Whenever you're ready. All right. One second. Just firing up. Okay, so the meeting ID is 547-827-585. I'm sorry, I lost you. 547-827- And then the last three are 585. Okay. Did we lose connection? Let me see. Nope, I see you. I'm going to hang up the phone.",
