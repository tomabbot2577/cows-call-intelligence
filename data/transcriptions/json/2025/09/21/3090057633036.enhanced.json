I wanted to give you a quick call. Your data conversion, I understood from your message, is kind of taking longer than it should have? Well, yeah. Initially, you said it would take a couple months. And then a month ago, they said, hey, we'll start it in a week or two. And then I get the exact same email Friday. Hey, somebody else's is taking longer. It's going to take another week or two before we can get started on it. So I'm like, I paid to get it started, and we haven't even got it started. for sure. Well, I'm actually in a meeting with my whole conversion team tomorrow at 2. I should know more. I'm going to try and press them on this one to try and get it hurried along. I know they had one, a big one from Bullhorn that took longer than they thought, which kind of delayed them a little bit, but I'm going to get the details and see kind of what's going on. Try and get some idea of pushing it forward and see what's going on, but I'll let you know once I talk with them tomorrow afternoon. Okay. Sounds perfect. All right. I appreciate it. Bye.",
