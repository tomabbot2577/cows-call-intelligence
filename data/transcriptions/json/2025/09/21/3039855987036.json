    "text": " Thank you for calling the eGroup. This is Julia. How may I help you? Hi, I'm with PC Recruiter. I received an email from Nathan Smith asking for help with an integration. Okay, let me transfer you right now. All right. This is Nathan. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received your email asking about AI note-taking. Yeah. Thanks for jumping on that. Wow. You're coming back fast. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. So we have we don't have any AI note taking inside of PCR, but some third party programs do integrate with PCR. There's one in particular called Quill, Q-U-I-L. This is an AI note taker that will make summaries with AI and stuff for your calls. And they have built an integration with PCR so that those notes and that summary of that call will go into the activities on a name record. And I've also heard of people using something called CallLogic as another third party platform. And I believe that is taking some kind of notes about the call and transferring over to PCR probably in the activity section as well. Why is it going to activity and not the notes section? Usually, when you make a call in PCR, you click on the phone dialer button. And add activity window pops up because that's usually where you would make any notes on a call activity is in the activity text. That's the intended kind of use. And that's why the pop up appears for the add activity window when you make a call. So real quick, I'm pulling up activities. I don't really use that. Okay. All right. So can you tell me, like, if I go for Quill, okay, is that going to be a subscription base for me to pay? Yeah, I think it's a third party. You'd have to pay for a subscription with any of these third parties that have built an integration with PCR. But I can send you, you know, what info I have about each of those companies, the CallLogic I've heard of, and Quill is the most popular one people use to integrate with PCR. Okay. And just so I'm clear, would they have their integrated PCR? And if I got a subscription, would they have instructions on how to operate within PCR? with it? Yeah, they would have a step-by-step on how to get their tool integrated into your particular PCR database, and they'll have more information about that setup as well as pricing and things like that. Okay. But ultimately, my goal is to be able to for myself and our other users to be able to have a phone call with somebody and, I guess, I don't know, I guess maybe record the phone call and then have it summarize the phone call in a note format for us. And I understand that that's going to go in the activities, but we could always just copy and paste it in the notes if we wanted. True. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. So that's what we're talking about here. And you're saying when you said call from within PCR, like how is – is there like where would I – is there something I have to do like connected with my phone system or how does that work? So we have integrations for like an on-screen dialer with RingCentral, also Google Voice. And so basically it would the little phone icon that sits to the right of a phone field. You could click that and it would bring an onscreen dialer through RingCentral or Google Voice or an onscreen dialer like that. And it would make the call through your headphones and speakers on the screen. and then with one of these AI summary tools, it would kind of summarize that call and then automatically put it into the activities. Okay. It's kind of a couple things there, a couple integrations. One is when someone's making the call. Yeah. And then one for the AI summary. So do I need, so Quill is the summarization AI, but is there another integration or another thing I need to be getting? You said Google, but is that another subscription-based thing I'm going to need to get and have it looped into PCR here? Possibly, yeah. How are you currently making the calls? Are you just dialing off on a separate phone Phone and then just writing your activities in PCR currently? Yeah. Manually? Okay. That's right. Yeah, it seems like you would almost want two integrations to make this the seamless process I think you're aiming for, where you would get like a RingCentral dialer and then connect that to Quill. So Quill can listen to that call and summarize it and then put it back into PCR all automatically. Okay, so RingCentral Dialer. Okay, is that – and that's another subscription-based service that I can just Google that. Yeah, I'll send you info about the RingCentral integration as well as the Quill. Yeah, those are the most popular. We do have an integration with Google Voice for an on-screen dialer, and I would have to check here to see if Quill talks to that one. Let me see if I have any notes on that. Integrations. Google Voice. OK. So this will, Google Voice integration allows users to click to dial or text via PCR record. Using this functionality, we'll record outbound activities to the record. Okay, I don't think that one's getting the inbound activities like RingCentral does. Yeah, if you were just moving forward on kind of updating the phone process in general, I would strongly recommend the RingCentral and Quill. Those are the most popular ones that our customers use to get that automated note-taking on each call. Mm-hmm. And you have some instructions you can send me. I should be able to go subscribe and have these all kind of integrated together without hiring some sort of developer or anything, right? Oh, yeah, yeah. No. Yeah, we can give you step-by-step, especially for RingCentral. It's just a few steps to connect that into PCR. And then Quill, they have step-by-step as well for their connection. But I think those are the two you would want, but no developer necessary. We'd be able to guide you through some of that here on our end as well. So RingCentral will, when I integrate that into here, you're saying that I would go to this activities tab, and then there would be some sort of phone icon. And I would click on the phone icon and then dial my phone? Or I'm trying to think how that – Yeah, let me explain it better. Sorry about that. So if you go to like any name record, you'll see certain phone fields like work phone, cell phone. Oh, right, right. There is a phone icon to the right of those fields that should be clickable if you have a like a RingCentral integration. You would just click right on that. It would start making the call on your screen, coming out your speakers or headphones, using your microphone. And so, yeah, that's the RingCentral part. But how is it making that call? So, yeah, I definitely see the cell phone down there. Okay. Yeah. Provider, Sprint Spectrum. Okay. So that'll make the call through a call service through an on-screen dialer like RingCentral. and then the AI is the other whole other integration that monitors that call and summarizes the conversation and puts it into the activities automatically on the other end so there's really nothing there's really nothing um you don't nobody would really have to go into the activities but if you wanted to copy it on notes you'd get activities copied over the notes Sure. Yeah, exactly. But the activities are being recorded automatically. Okay. Yeah, I think, I mean, that sounds exactly what I'm trying to accomplish. So, yeah, if you could, you know, email me those instructions, that'd be fantastic. And I may have some more fine-tuned questions for you after I get into it. But that sounds like a great way to start. Absolutely. I'll send you info about both of those third parties there. And, yeah, set up if you need help at all. We are happy to help with that. Any more questions that come up? Yeah, okay, perfect. Well, thank you so much, Garrett. I appreciate it. Yep, happy to help. Look out for an email from me soon. Will do. Thanks. Bye.",
