    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi there. My name is Avery. I'm with Variant Partners. And I was wondering, I spoke to Beth Turner recently, or rather my boss, David, did about kind of a lawsuit that's going on and how she recommends getting a copy of database data. I was just wondering how to go about requesting that. Sure. So we would need, let's see, we would need a request from your contract signer, David. You could send it to support at mainsequence.net, and we would just have them sign a document. And then a full data return is $175 fee that we could just charge the credit card on file. and then we'll have our tech team get that backed up for you and sent your way. Okay. Sounds good. How long does that process usually take? It kind of varies depending on how many tasks the tech team are currently working on, if there's other data returns. I've seen it take maybe a week, a couple more days, a couple less, kind of around that range. Okay, good to know. I will send him over that info and then go from there. Awesome. That sounds good. Anything else you've been having trouble with? Nope, that's all. I appreciate your help. All righty, have a great rest of your day. You too, bye. Bye.",
