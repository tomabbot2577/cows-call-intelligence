    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm well, thank you. I'm calling about an invoice that I've been receiving that is an error. I keep getting invoices saying that I owe a bill to Main Sequence, and I don't even have an account with you. Okay. What is your name? My name is Charles Broome and the company is Wireless Group. I have an invoice number if you need that too. Yeah, that would actually be really helpful. What's the invoice number? 2202304. 220, I'm sorry, say that again. Had a little fumble finger there for a moment. Yes, 220-2304. Okay. Oh, that's why I spelled it wrong. Okay. Rylas Grove.

It's been several years. Okay. And... I think this was created... Let me look over here. Brian Lester. Okay, let me look at the company name. He switched billing systems and I wonder. That should not have been generated. I think they went off like a recent transaction, tried to make a new invoice because you were like a sales receipt before. This should not have been created. Okay, so. Yeah. Okay. I'm fixing this right now. I apologize for that. we had somebody helping us out to kind of get caught up with the new billing system and that was created an error okay because i'm like somebody signed me up for something that i did not uh yeah yeah you um what's your cancellation date yeah you canceled yeah i'm putting this i'm putting it as a note so they actually in case anybody else ever goes to see this they see that it's canceled i'm taking care of it right now for you all right all righty so this one is voided the recurring has been deleted and I'm making the billing account I don't know why they created that to be honest so it's all fixed you can ignore that I'm so sorry about that okay I just want to make sure we're good thank you alright yeah we're good thank you alright thank you so much Howdy.
