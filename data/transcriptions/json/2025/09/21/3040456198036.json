Thank you. Hey Linda, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a call. I had to schedule for a call today and it looks like there's an iPhone X Max 2 dialed in, but you can't hear me or I haven't got a chat back or anything like that and there's no screen share or anything like that so I'm trying to connect with you I'll send you a text as well but give me a quick call let me know if today still works 440-856-0314",
