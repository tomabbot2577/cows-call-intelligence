    "text": " Thank you for calling Chuck Andrews. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello, Chuck. Hello, Chuck. This is Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good, Jim. How are you? I am well. I got your inquiry through our website. Wanted to give you a quick call, kind of see what I could do. yeah um let's see here i'm trying to recollect why what what was the issue now because i'm not having any trouble with pc recruiter but there was something some additional feature i guess right it might have been the ai suite that they kind of added for everybody as a trial for now yeah yeah that's what it was i guess um so yeah what can you tell me about it okay well what it does it kind of adds three or four three or four depending on what your database is set up as three or four areas in the system. There's going to be some content generators. So you have on any email send screen from PC Recruiter, there's a little icon that will help you generate an email. And you can say, do you want it to be instructive, introductory, friendly, casual, whatever. And you can tell it what you want to talk about, and then it'll generate an email for you. Kind of along those lines. There's also a job description generator and candidate summary generator on both of those sorts of screens. So you can kind of go to a candidate summary tab, click that and it'll generate a summary based off of their fields and their resume. So a couple little generators there and then you might also notice an AI search up in the top quick search button and that is something that'll kind of allow you a more conversational search. You can like Show Me People in Cleveland or something like that, just for basic field search, a little more conversational search, if you want to try that out. So it's all available in the database now. You can give it a try and see if you like it. And I think if you keep it, it's like $5 per month per user if you chose to keep it. But they kind of put it for free for now for a little while. So what it does then as far as like if I want to search the database, it's basically searching my PC recruiter database, right? It's not doing a LinkedIn or just a general Internet search. So if I wanted to find somebody, who was that guy I talked to three years ago, and he was in Cleveland and that kind of thing, I could do a search and find that, right, without having to have all the right fields selected, correct? Yes, yes. It's a little bit more easier of a search for something like that, but only inside of PC Recruiter. And I don't know if it's going to be shown up on your database or not because you're not on our premium package. You're only on Enterprise. So I don't know. Do you see any of those buttons? Like if you look, for example, at summary. Right now I'm not seeing much. I had eye surgery last week, so I'm kind of like, yeah, I'm not seeing very much. But, yeah, so I have the enterprise level, and I don't have the premium. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, you don't have premium. I don't know how it will work with that because normally it requires premium to have. But you'll notice, if you happen to notice, it's like a little PC recruiter logo. It's kind of purplish blue, usually over to the end of the summary or the job description field. It'll show up in there. Okay. Well, I can't find it right now, so I'll have to wait until my eyes recover a little bit. As far as the premium, I guess I didn't know that I didn't have the premium service. What benefits would I have if I had that instead of the level that I do have? For sure. Well, you're on enterprise now. What the premium adds to that is going to be custom analytics reporting, so you can kind of build interactive custom reports. It's also going to give you a nice email campaigns tool to be able to send email campaigns, queue them up to be sent. It will also let you see clicks, opens, unsubscribes, returns, replies, et cetera. And then also the sequencing piece. So there's a drip campaigns and sequences piece that's also included in that. So you could set up an automated drip campaign, or even a campaign that might say, send them an email first. If they reply, add them to my call list. If they don't touch it in three days, send them another email or something like that. It's a little more automated emails and such. Okay. And what's the additional cost for that? It's an additional $20 per user per month. It includes the AI, and then it is a $500 set up. That includes six hours training and the installation of all those pieces there onto your database. Okay. Good. Well, very good. Well, Jim, I appreciate your calling and bringing me up to speed on this stuff. For sure. For sure. I'll pop you a quick email with a little bit of information about the AI. So when you're ready to take a look, you can see my email, see a little bit about how it works. And then let me know if you have any questions or if you ever think about maybe exploring the addition or the upgrade. Very good. Thank you. Very well. All right. Thank you. We'll see you. Bye-bye.",
