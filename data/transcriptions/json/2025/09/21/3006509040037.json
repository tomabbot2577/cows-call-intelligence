    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Brian Gallagher. Just curious on having an issue importing a LinkedIn profile into my PCR, like that little thing that pops up, the little logo. The capture logo? Yeah, that's not popping up. Any idea why that's not coming up? Sure. if you go to the top right of your browser, do you see the PCR capture up there that opens up the capture menu? I do. Yep. If you click on that, are you seeing in that capture menu a list of websites with toggles or is it asking you to put in your PCR URL? Let's see. So you're talking like, so I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on a profile, for example, and then I hit the little um you see our button and it pulls up yeah so it pulls up like there's like two tabs one says capture one says match okay so that means you are signed in so that's a good sign um yeah and then at the bottom right of that menu does it say basic mode where it's toggled off it's like they're wait is it toggled on or off It looks like they're all off. Left would be off, which is a good thing. We want the basic mode toggled off. So is the toggle to the left on basic mode? The toggle's – no. So the toggle's on the right. Like, it's shown blue for, like, LinkedIn Recruiter, LinkedIn Recruiter Lite, LinkedIn Sales, LinkedIn. Yeah, those ones are going to all be on. Yeah, those are just a list of websites. but below that where it says basic mode, is that toggled to the left or to the right? Basic mode. I don't see basic mode anywhere. Oh, it would be below that box that contains that list of websites like LinkedIn, LinkedIn Recruiter Lite. There should be three more toggles below that. One says basic mode. One says dark mode. capture to default company. Are any of those appearing on your screen? I don't see those in this little button. Do you want me to click the three dots on the Chrome? No, it should be in this capture menu. When you click on this capture menu, are you seeing the log out button in blue at the bottom left? I do. I see that. Oh, wait. I'm sorry. I see, I was looking in on the, like the, okay. So I see basic mode, dark mode, capture is just a fault company. I do see that now. Sorry. Okay. Are those, that's fine. Are they off to the left? Okay, good. So that's a good sign. And then you can close that capture menu. And if you're looking at a LinkedIn profile, just click the refresh button in your browser. And let's see if refreshing the page will have that click to add button pop up. Nope. Okay. Let's jump on a screen share then. I'm going to just start one up real quick. One second. Okay. All right. All right, so in a new tab in your browser, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. All right. And is it asking for a meeting ID? Yeah. Okay. That is 512-251-706. Perfect. And if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. and then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top awesome that's loading okay cool let's go back to your tab that has LinkedIn open. All right, so we're on David here. Just click that refresh button one more time up at the top. See, yep, not appearing there on the right. Oh, it says there is a new Chrome available. Let's check two things. So click the three dots at the top right of your browser and then go down to extensions and manage extensions and at the top right turn on developer mode this is going to turn on the version numbers okay so PCR capture 1.1.9 okay that's the right version that's good and then it's telling us that there's a newer version of Chrome that might be what it needs. But if you do update Chrome, it will close out of all your tabs and then reopen them. So, I mean, there are a lot of tabs there, so I don't want you to lose any. Yeah. Most of the time, the relaunch reopens all of them. But if there's anything like super important that you need to hit save on, I would maybe do that before updating Chrome. is there any that you know of that you might want to hit save or anything like that they're just it's literal um i'm a recruiter right so i find these like random lists and i'm like okay here's a list like i'm gonna add these people and i just keep them okay you know what i mean so but they're just like lists from websites that like my computer's going super slow it's not even gonna load um it's just a reminder for me and i just you know i get backed up but that's really it's I would imagine if I close everything, like when my computer restarts randomly on its own sometimes. Okay. And then it reopens all these tabs and it pretty much brings them all to the same spot. So is that essentially what it would do? Yeah, that's what the relaunch usually does. So we'll try that to go to the three dots again at the top right of the browser. and then all the way down towards the bottom says help and then about Google Chrome that'll start nearly up-to-date relaunch Chrome to finish updating okay so that's where you hit relaunch and it'll kind of close out and reopen everything there it might take a second and this one oh Oh, that's about PCR. You can hit leave, or this meeting will leave, but we're still on the audio, so that's fine. And that one's for PCR. Okay, that's fine. All right, so still connected via phone. And once Chrome relaunches, we'll probably be back in the RingCentral meeting together again. Okay. you think will just automatically um reload and like reopen all these tabs eventually yeah yeah Do you guys, it may have been you that suggested this or somebody else, but I'm looking into, I need to eventually get like a better kind of organized email, like for blast emails, more for content for my like current client, like something like this. Like I do a new hires thing. I send a client. So instead of like a blast email through PCR to make it look like prettier, kind of like a constant contact looking thing. You guys use SendGrid, right? Or you recommend SendGrid? Yeah, SendGrid, we usually recommend just as like the sender where you make an alias inside of PCR, an additional alias. And when you're about to send out an email blast or even a sequence in PCR, you can say send it from my regular alias or my SendGrid alias, and you can choose kind of in the from field on the email which one you want to send it from. Okay. But, yeah, SendGrid's the one that we see the most with our customers. So is SendGrid kind of like a constant contact or MailChimp kind of thing, or is it a little different? it might be a little different they might I know that MailChimp I've used that one before it's where you can design the emails and make them HTML rich with photos and all these things SendGrid the way our customers use it it's just a relay service where you're still generating all the content inside of PCR and then when you hit send SendGrid takes care of the sending part instead of your email provider like Microsoft or something like that, which allows you to have larger sending limits. Because I know Microsoft has limits you hit and you get in trouble or too many this hour, too many this day. The SendGrid kind of works around all that and you kind of use them as a mass email sender. Oh, OK. Gotcha. How's it looking? Did any Chrome tabs reopen at all? Not automatically. I'm hitting the Google Chrome button now. Okay. Just open up a blank thing. I'm just going to see. I'll give it a second. I just hit it and nothing's popping up. It might be syncing. Okay, it's still just kind of loading. Okay. Yeah, at least with the capture tool, that is a common troubleshooting step where the latest Chrome needs to be installed installed, so that should fix that part. We'll see, though. We'll test it. Okay. That's good to know. I don't know, man. I hit it a couple times. It's not coming up. I'm assuming it's going to take a while to get it up and going again. Yeah, it looks like it's trying to just fire off that initial relaunch one, so it won't even load separate instances of you just clicking the button. I see. Okay. So you're thinking once I'm able to relaunch Chrome and LinkedIn and PCR again, restart everything, that should do it because I updated Chrome? Yeah, that's the only other troubleshooting thing we didn't look at initially, and I think that would fix it. if it doesn't, could, I guess, call back and we'll just keep trying other things. But I would just kind of hold tight and see if Chrome can load all those tabs again on its own, you know, before restarting your computer or anything like that. And if it takes a really long time and it's still not loading, then maybe restart your computer. But I'm hoping that it'll just be able to relaunch like it normally does after an update. the button we clicked said relaunch right it didn't say like I remember looking I think it says relaunch that's normally what it says there and that's what it said yeah okay good yeah so that's what closes it down reopens with all the tabs so I think it's just kind of struggling to get that all opened again but yeah just waiting on that okay so yeah so I can I don't want to hold you up so because it's i don't know how long it's going to take so if i have i'm gonna cross my fingers hope that works uh if not then um i'll just reach back out yeah just give us a call if if the relaunch didn't work on the or the chrome update didn't work just let us know okay um okay awesome sounds good we'll do appreciate your help all right yeah no problem have a good one",
