    "text": " Thank you for coming today. I was wondering, Tyler, how can I help you? Yes, I need help with the timesheet. Yeah, what's going on? Hold on one second for a moment. I'm here. Yeah, what's going on? What's the time? Yep, can you hear me? Yep, I got you. I just have our first contractor actually out this week. She's completing technically her first week this week, and she had two days from the week before. I was wondering if I could, because we need to get that out and get it out for approval to the approvers. Okay, let me take a look here. Do you want me to share my screen with you? I can see it on here. So last week was her. So she started technically, like I actually can't see it. When I go to hours, it only does it by week periods. So what you can do is if you go to hours and do the search for this week, you'll see that that person pops up. Right. If you click on where it says timesheet, you'll see it pop open at the bottom half. and you'll see it says time sheet but it just shows the bill right 23 and a half hours in process right so that's why you want to go to the I want to part and do action edit where is that so when you so where it says in the top half you'll see where it says time sheet next to where the NFC. Click where it says timesheet, and you'll see down on the bottom half of the screen, it opens up, and you'll see the action over to the left. Yep. And then do edit. Yep. And then you can go to hours. Okay, I see that now. And so, like, are the... Is last week's getting built separately? No, it's going to be combined into this week. Okay. So, yeah, you can see... Do-do-do. Okay, so we need to create one for last week, then. Because that's our hours for this week. Well, it's already in there for last week. But you're saying there needs to be a separate one for last week? Let me take a look here. So I go hours. I'll go to week 30 instead of 31. Right. That's where I'm at. Drop down all approvers. let me take a look here so last week she was only on for 9.25 hours. I don't know if you see that. There are the approvers on the right option. You just need to send it out for them to get approved right now for this. I need to send this first one out for last week, I guess, right? It should have done it automatically, I thought. Yes, it does, but what you can do to resend it is in the top half to the left-hand side of the NFC, you can click that checkbox. Yep. Go to the options menu in the top right. Remind approvers? Yep. All selected timesheets have been submitted. No reminders sent. I think I need to do a form letter now this isn't working you know let me take a look here Let me take a look at their activity. Yeah, it's not, you can't really see everything the way that I thought we'd be able to. Are you going to swing by the public, by any chance, about this prescription? I can't do it with Mikey. I thought this would be set up for it to go automatically out once she submitted her timesheet. Yeah, that is enabled. I don't know why this platform is so difficult. Let me double check your database's outgoing mail settings here. I've been sent them in. Yeah, those all look good. Yep, those are correct. Do you know when she submitted that timesheet? She was on last Thursday and Friday. which you can see I go to hours go to week 30 and you can see that she did 9.25 hours but like when did she actually submit the hours like fully well for that time period I guess it still says in process it says status in process That's probably why. Yes. Yeah, let me take one. Let me. Ah, yep. Yeah, so the contractor will need to go into the app and submit the hours for that week. Okay, so we need her to go into the app. Yep, go to week 30 for those two days and actually submit. We can submit the hours from last week on the application, on the PC recruiter application. On last week, 720, what was it? 720. 725. 24 and 25. So 25 on the PCR recruiter application. on your phone. And then when you complete your hours by close of business today, please do the same for this week. What was it? 7-28 through August 8th. August 1st. And then will I be on that email? Can you set it up where I see the email actually go out to the approvers? Yeah, you'll be able to see it in the activities on the approvers. It'll be because it's coming from you. You'll see it in your sent messages and on the activities on the approvers. Last week should already be in there, she's saying. So, her hours, she has her hours in there, but she actually needs to, there's another process to submit them. There is another button to submit. Yep. So, let me find exactly where that's at for you. She sent me a screenshot, and it shows 9.25 hours, and she just needs to click the submit button with the little clock on it. Yep. All right. Let's see. If she needs any help, do you have a direct line or extension? So we can't help the contractor specifically with the app. If she can call directly into the general support line, I actually have a meeting here in about 10 minutes. but anybody with the general support team would be able to help her. Okay. So once she clicks submit, then the automated email should go out to the approvers, correct? Yep, that's all set up. I checked all that. And then once she clicks submit, will I get notified or there will be no notification? Well, let me check the settings here. One second, just double checking your settings here. yes you'll get it as well you have it set up to well when the time sheets approved by the you'll get a notification by the got it okay she just did it so She just clicked it, so should I get a notification or no? Not for her submitting it. But I should see a sent email that goes out. Okay, there it goes. Approve hours, Kimberly. Let's see how that looks. Okay, cool. All right. That is good. That is good. Okay. Yep. And then on her, thank you so much on her name record, the contractor's name record, you'll see, um, like an hour submitted activity. Right. Okay. Perfect. Yep. Yeah. So you just got to make sure to do that last step at the end of the week to hit the submit and then it will trigger all the automations for you. All right. So now we're set. Once you click submit, we should be good. Okay. Thank you very much for your help. I appreciate it. I'm more than happy to, if you need anything else, just let us know. Have a good day.",
