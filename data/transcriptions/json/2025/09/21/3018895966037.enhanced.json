    "text": " Thank you for calling Mean Sequence Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Yeah, we've had an issue that has been going on for several years now. It's very intermittent and have not been able to have it taken care of. The last time it happened, I think someone said to call in while it's happening on our end. That might be able to get us closer to a fix. So it's happening right now. And I was wondering if we can have someone look at that. The last person I spoke to about it, I think was Sean. Is he still there? Sean is not with us anymore. What company are you with? The Jacob Group. Okay. And what was your name? Matt Jacob. Okay, give me one second. Okay, and what's the issue? Like, what's happening? So our name screen is, you know, obviously organized how we prefer. And sometimes, not all the time, just randomly, when we open up a name record, the fields will be completely scrambled in a random order. So it's just, you know, people end up sometimes inadvertently putting things in the wrong field because they're just, you know, muscle memory. They're going to a field in a certain spot and it's not the right field. It's just causing trouble there. Okay. Here, give me one second. Let me do a little bit of digging on this. um looks like the last time we reported it was a bit ago um I mean I have looking back at my emails I've had um looks like the earliest the earliest email I can recall I'm pretty sure I asked them before this was even back to 2022 so there's been it's weird it'll be fine And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it'll, you know, everyone will start pinging me and saying, hey, it's happening again. And I'm like, OK, well. So Sean, in his signature line, it says lead support engineer. Who took his spot? um his name's uh mackenzie mackenzie took over for scott i mean uh for sean okay um just wondering who might be there that would have um mackenzie would probably be the person we want to bring in on this okay um like you actively have it on your screen right now so yeah the thing is if if i click on a name and it loads scrambled if I click on it again literally one second later it might load fine it might you know 10 seconds later it might load scrambled it's a roll of dice um but I have it up on the screen scrambled right now so it I don't know if that's going to do any good other than just a you know a visual of what's happening but I've sent you know screenshots of this many times before so okay I'm just we we it It looks like we've been tracking this in our ticketing system, so I'm just reading over that to take a look. Do you know if anyone's ever run or like re-indexed your database? I couldn't say for sure. Yeah. I'm wondering if that's a good thing. That sounds similar. I feel like we may have done that. I'm not sure if it was for this issue or something else. Yeah. When you say re-index, what exactly does that entail? Re-indexing your database is kind of like it's, to be completely honest, it's a little more tech savvy than I am. But I know it is just kind of like a general database health thing that needs to happen every so often. Like not to any particular frequency, but it does tend to be a good starting place when there is information loading issues. yeah i mean it's it's like that all the information is is there they're you know the the right data is in the right fields it's just the the actual fields on the screen are not in the right position that's all so it's like there's no scrambling of data or anything like that it's just um it's just like a like i said like the the front end kind of like the loading or something like that yeah um Let me see if I can get a hold of Mackenzie really quick. Give me one second. Okay. like you're saying that the fields are lining up with what the data should be. It's just, they're not in the order that they should be in. Right. Like it'll say first name, Stephanie, last name, Velasco, the phone number, and it has a phone number. So, but they're just not, like we have them grouped out in different sections on the page and the fields are just moving around to the different sections. If that makes sense. yeah so there's no like information in the wrong places it's just the layout itself is like shifting right yeah like the data that is pulling from like the the database itself seems fine it's just the way it's loading is scrambled like the configuration on the screen um do all of your um this might be a big question but do all of your users have the same layout or do people have different layouts based on different users? For the most part, they're all the same. There might be a couple that have a few. I think there's a couple people that have additional fields that really they only need access to. Do you know about how many users you have by chance? 10 or so. Okay. Around 10. So the things I'm thinking we could try. large scale, I would say we should try and re-index your database just to check. Because again, it's not harmful to do that. It's usually just a good thing to do that every so often. We could try that. But also I would wonder if it would be okay if we could try and do like apply, is it name records, companies, positions, or does it just seem to be any of them? um i personally only noticed it on name records i'm pretty sure i've only had name records being reported to me as well i'm not sure if people have but i mean name records is you know we that's 90 of what we're opening up so yeah um because what i'm reading through this ticket they like internal conversations every um the last person that you spoke to with about this i think was two months ago as Garrett. Internally, we're having a lot of trouble actually being able to recreate this because it seems to be something that's very specific to something in your database. So what I think maybe we should try, and I'll talk to Mackenzie before I have you do this, but I think maybe we could apply a layout globally to your users. Like whatever you have or someone has whichever your standard layout you would like, just globally applying it to everyone in the hopes that maybe if there's something stuck there, it would just kind of overwrite it. So I think that might also be a good place to start. But again, I would want to I would want to talk to McKenzie before doing anything like that, because this is kind of like a an anomalous issue. so I don't want to just get a picture and do something. Yeah, it's definitely strange. And I'm not surprised that you guys have not been able to recreate it because if someone tells me it's happening to them, I'll go click 100 times and it's never going to happen. It's just, it's like, I don't even know. It's very rare, not super rare, but like maybe every couple of weeks or every couple of months, It'll just say hello and there's the bug and we'll experience it for like, I don't know, an hour or something here and there. And then it just kind of goes away. Okay. But let me. But it's been for years. I'm going to tag Garrett and Mackenzie in the ticket that you have open. And we will follow up with you. I'm going to throw some ideas at them and see what they think. But even maybe having Mackenzie look at this with fresh eyes. Mackenzie is from our development team and we've kind of had done a little bit of restructuring. So Mackenzie has moved down to the support. I'm not down, but laterally to the support department. So maybe getting fresh eyes on it with someone who works a little more intimately with that kind of stuff might be a good thing. So I'll loop in Mackenzie on this and I'll just kind of, we'll re, the tickets open, but we'll bring it back forward and get everyone looped in on this. But I think what I'm going to suggest to them is maybe trying to globally apply name record layouts and maybe see if re-indexing would do anything. So I'll reach out to them and we'll be in touch with you. But I appreciate you letting us know and I'll bring this to their attention. The only other thing real quick is I can't remember who it was that said this, but they said we they said we need when this is happening. we need someone to call in while it's happening. I'm not sure what they were planning on doing, but since I have it open on my screen, is there anything that you want me to capture? I mean, I've done screenshots, like I've said, but is there anything else that would be valuable? Let's actually, yeah, let's get on a screen share. Maybe we can open the, are you in Google Chrome? I'm in Edge right now. I'm sure there's something like in Edge. I just have to find it. I wanted to see if we can open the development tools on Edge and see what the information is saying. Do you have RingCentral? Yes, I do. Okay. Go ahead and open RingCentral, and we'll do a screen share. Okay. Let's see here. I'm on my cell phone. Switch to... Okay, I'm going to switch to my computer. This is pretty basic troubleshooting, so I imagine people have swapped you with this over the years that this has been popping up. I imagine you've played your cache on your browser before, so that's right. One second, sorry. Oh, you're good. Okay. Sorry about that. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Okay. Sorry. I was switching over here and I had to get my headphones connected. You asked if I cleared cache. Is that right? Yeah. I cleared your browser cache. Yeah. I mean... Not like in this particular instance, but throughout the process of this, I imagine you would have because that's what you're troubleshooting. Yeah, we've done that. I mean, the thing is, is it might, it might, you might clear your cache and then try to reproduce the problem and it doesn't come back. And it's like, well, yeah, clearing the cache is a problem or is it just not there anymore? Not doing it. But then it comes back. And the other thing that I would say, I'm not sure what it would, I'm not very familiar with cash and how it might impact several people. But when it happens to one person in the office, it might happen to several others, like on the same, within the same hour even. So I'm not sure how that would tie in with clearing cache. You know what I mean? It's just, it seems like there's a, there's a time element to it where it's affecting kind of everyone. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. It probably wouldn't be your cache then. Browser cache is like locally stored to your internet browser to help with loading, like load speeds and stuff like that. So if it's happening to one person and then happening to everyone at the same time, it's probably not your browser. Yeah. Okay, so you wanted me to share my screen? Yeah, so in RingCentral, I'm going to have you join a meeting. Okay. And let me know when you're ready for the meeting ID. Let me go to here. These pop-ups everywhere. Did you know? Okay. Oh, here. Okay, start meeting. You're not going to start. You're going to join. I've never done it this way before. Go to video on the left side. Yeah. I got it. Okay. What's the ID? 543-488-419. And should I just continue without audio since we're on the call? Yeah. That'd be easier. Yeah. share my screen all right can you see my screen yeah i can see it um let me let me log into your database really quick i'm going to pull up the exact same record oh okay i was just going to open it another time but um Which database are you in? The Jacob group? Yeah, the Jacob group. Okay, cool. Okay, Stephanie Velasco. Yeah. Okay. I imagine it loaded fine for you, right? Yeah, it did. Okay. In, let me find out how to open the dev tools. Go to the top right corner of your browser window where the three dots are. Go to more tools, third option from the bottom. developer tools. Mm-hmm. Okay. This is going to be hard to read. Can you make this bigger? Yeah, if we could. I don't know if it would zoom in the developer tools, though. Oh, perfect. Okay. Do you mind if I take remote control? Oh, shoot. You don't have that turned on. accessibility. And probably going to have to reboot RingCentral then after I do this, I think. Let's see if it'll even work. Did that work? Oh, there we go. Perfect. okay you have do you have gdpr in your database what you mean having it that you would know if you have it okay then probably not okay what is that i mean isn't that like something with um like compliance it's like yeah it tends to be more European it's like a consent thing consent to be contacted failed to load modules failed to load resources edit okay does this move over I'm going to take a few screenshots if that's okay with you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry, this is taking a second. I was trying to get as much information as possible. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Really quick, hold on. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and start the recording. Okay. Really quick, hold on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. okay Thank you. Okay. Sources. Where are we? What are we in? Details. Edit name. CcRecruiter. Apps. And then we have the recruiter apps modules and that is pages name market page you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. I think I got what I can. I appreciate your patience. I know it was a lot of sitting. So let me get what I have sent over to Mackenzie and Garrett, and I'll bring that to their attention. And we'll follow up with you once we do a little bit of digging into this. But I think what I got from the console has been helpful. Okay, good. Okay. All right. We will follow up with you um and uh hopefully we'll get this fired out okay thanks thanks matt bye",
