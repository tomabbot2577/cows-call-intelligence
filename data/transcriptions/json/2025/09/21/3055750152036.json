    "text": " Good afternoon, people. Hey, Jim, it's Andrew Zhu. I think you just left me a message. I did, yeah. Okay. The invoice, to see if that didn't go through or what? Yeah, it went through and I already paid. Oh, okay. And maybe, I think, did you pay it today or over the weekend? No, no, last week. Probably Thursday, Friday. Let me check on that because I just didn't see any update in the ticket system here. But I think the person who sent it, she's moving kids into college this week, so she may have been a little bit behind the times or anything. But let me check and make sure. Okay. Let me check and make sure. And so I will note that it's paid. We'll get it pushed through to get it installed, but I'll confirm and I'll let you know when I find out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'll see. Do you remember when it was? Was it Friday? Probably Friday, Thursday. I don't remember. Let me just take a look at my bank to see when that's. Let me just. One second. Yeah, it was on Friday, and then you'll have a receipt if you're interested. Perfect. Now, just knowing it's on Friday, I will double-check to make sure they have it, and I will pop you an email and let you know what I find out. Yeah, do you have access to the email right now? Oh, I have my email. Yeah, I don't send the invoices, but I can get an email. Okay, let me just forward you the paid invoice. Just a minute. Oh, wait. I have it here. I have it on 815. I'm just looking through but I didn't see the email come through so it looks like it came I just hadn't seen the email come in my box so no they haven't they processed it they just didn't have it I'm sorry for I caught it in confusion so yeah the install ticket will be entered this afternoon so I am I just forward you a copy that was sent to me, the receipt. Yep, paid on the 15, and that matches up to what I'm looking at in my system here. I had it, no, it wasn't that it was in my queue. I just hadn't seen it. I don't know if it got deleted out of my inbox or whatever. But, yeah, I have it in here right now, and I see it is all set to go. So I will go ahead and enter the installation ticket momentarily. Okay. Okay. So what will happen next, you'll get an email from probably McKenzie. He is the ASP admin that creates the database links. That will have your link and your admin username and password. And then I'll put your trainer aside, and then I'll reach out to get a consulting call set up between me, you, and the trainer. Yeah, actually, that probably would be good. Okay, yeah. So my training will be set up on the national search. We'll be coming up, yeah. So I will get you set up on that very soon. Okay. Very well. I'm glad you called, and that jogged my memory. I found it here, so we are all good to go. Great. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.",
