And we are a client of yours, but I do need to cancel our whatever you call it. So I'm not sure. We have just one license at the moment. And who would I talk to to do that? I don't know if it's an email or a call or how we do that. Yeah, it all depends on your contract and stuff, too. Let me even see. Hold on one second. Okay. Probably best to start with Jim Lombardo. Let me see if I can get him for you. Hold on one second. Okay, great. Thanks. Thanks. Sure. um deborah yes all right debbie um he is not available at the moment what i'm going to do is i'm going to compose an email with this contact information if you can follow up with him and he will get back to you on that sound good so you're going to send me the email or him an email I'm going to send it to both of you.
