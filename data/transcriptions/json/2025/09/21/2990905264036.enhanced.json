    "text": "Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. Bob Meissner. How are you, my old friend? I'm well, Bob. How are you? Well, I'm great. I'm great. You probably had dozens and dozens of these telephone calls about people who have aged out of recruiting or the needs for PC Recruiter. And in a way, that's a real sadness, and I hope you're taking this well. We have had a lot And I think it's just We've been around 26, 27 years And people are starting to That started at the beginning Are starting to get retired So we have been having a little bump in Retirements and people just closing down And separating and doing their own thing Oh absolutely And I think we were with you From the very, very beginning Because I remember working with Tim Lawler I don't think he works with you anymore but Lawler and Associates in Wisconsin, that's where I started, and I have my own office, blah, blah, blah. So, yeah, I probably should have pulled this plug five years ago and saved all that money, but there were several times where I thought I might get back into it. Now I've absolutely positively concluded I can't. And, Jim, does it mean that my files and all that data is deleted, or is it archived and where a year from now or somebody couldn't come and buy into being able to look at that data? How does that work? Well, we archive it, and it's there for about a year, usually a little bit longer than a year, so that if something did happen that you wanted to turn it back on or anything like that, you could kind of turn it back on, or if you sold it to someone, we should probably have it, and we could get it and just turn it back on. if you wanted to request a data return we could make the database the sequel database available for you for download then you could keep it wherever you have and you wouldn't need us you could just give it to someone else they could take it back to PC recruiter or anywhere else yeah well I think it's a assist or the other option is if you need a data perhaps to get a hold of anyone you could push it out into a CSV just like export a roll-up list take the data you need from there that way it's usable but you couldn't really yeah but you could give it some but it wouldn't be the full database it would just be field data well it's so bizarre like for example um uh we have because i'm a latin american area specialist there were dozens and dozens of individuals who were uh in my database for latin america all over and um One of them, I have no way of being able to get a hold of them, the Fodrejo family in Colombia. And the only place I would turn to would be PC Recruiter to dig into that. I wouldn't even know how anymore to access that right now, this minute. I wouldn't even know how to get a hold of, you know, go in there because I haven't been inside PC Recruiter for five years. I haven't looked at one single contact in PC recruiters since 2019 or 2020. It's just, I'm not sure how I'd get into that. So I think that's it. So I won't have another charge. Is that correct? I sure hope I'm charge-free now, no more invoices. I don't think so. Nick and Robin will confirm if you do. I don't think so because it looks like you would have renewed on the 12th, so there probably wouldn't be a charge. I don't know if maybe there's one more, but I don't think for half the month. They'll confirm for sure, but I think since you're on hold, it would only be $20 anyway if it were, but they can let you know for sure because I don't have visibility to that. No, and I'd really like that forgiven. And I just really would like to just say, hey, if you're not using it, it was on hold, there wasn't much value per se. Yes, there was a lot of value per se if you lit up the fire again, but that'd be great if I didn't go through that again. I just don't want, I'm trying to do a budget. Every $20 now for us as retired people in our late 70s, it counts. I just don't want to pay for it. So if you can let them know. I'll throw in the table. Yeah, that'd be great. So before I close, just tell me how you are, Jim. How's it been for you? Are you looking forward to just another few years, or do you see a long runway for yourself at Main Sequence? I think I'll be here for a while longer. I don't see any quick exit or anything. I'm sticking around. Good. I've still got a few more years to go before I'm ready to retire, but who knows? Something else could come up between now and then, but for now, I'm staying here for now. Excellent. And Gretchen, she's the daughter, Bill's daughter, isn't that right? Gretchen, his ex-wife, actually. Ex-wife. Ex-wife. Oh, I didn't realize that. Okay. That's great. Okay. Well, it was good to see her on there. I only copied her because she and I, there had been correspondence, and I just wanted her to know and also to pass on my my kind regards to bill whom i assume is still in hawaii is that true he's been back here for quite a while a few months he's been back here but he's still based out of hawaii yeah he's just been back here i think the summer weather brings him back a little more often here okay well you bump into him in the hallways it's just a quick hello because it was very early on and we met many times at different conventions and so on so i got to know him and liked him and I thought he had a brilliant idea. I trust you guys have been growing, staying, holding your own or shrinking here over the last couple of years. I would say about holding our own. I would say holding our own. We've been able to close enough new business to offset the people leaving and retiring and everything like that. So we're doing all right. We're doing all right. Excellent. Excellent to hear that. Well, that's it, my friend. I'll just wait. I did get that confirmation. I do have your telephone number now in my personal database in case it's needed and all I can say is thank you Jim for Many years of being a backup and other guys like Nick as well. So, okay Sure. Yeah, if anything you need let me know and I will I've also put a note to see if they can kind of not Charge anything more. I'll just put in there. Thank you so much. It's much appreciated much appreciated Take care of my friend. Be well the summer. Take care. All right. You take care. Bye. Bye",

00:00:06,635\nBob Meissner.\n\n5\n00:00:07,325 --> 00:00:08,093\nHow are you, my old friend?\n\n6\n00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,169\nI'm well, Bob.\n\n7\n00:00:09,622 --> 00:00:10,091\nHow are you?\n\n8\n00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,877\nWell, I'm great.\n\n9\n00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,187\nI'm great.\n\n10\n00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,026\nYou probably had dozens and dozens of these telephone calls about people who have\n\n11\n00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,090\naged out of recruiting or the needs for PC Recruiter.\n\n12\n00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,792\nAnd in a way, that's a real sadness, and I hope you're taking this well.\n\n13\n00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,610\nWe have had a lot And I think it's just We've been around 26,\n\n14\n00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,364\n27 years And people are starting to That started at the beginning Are starting to\n\n15\n00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:37,986\nget retired So we have been having a little bump in Retirements and people just\n\n16\n00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:42,669\nclosing down And separating and doing their own thing Oh absolutely And I think we\n\n17\n00:00:42,849 --> 00:00:43,710\nwere with you From the very,\n\n18\n00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,931\nvery beginning Because I remember working with Tim Lawler I don't think he works\n\n19\n00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:49,093\nwith you anymore but Lawler and Associates in Wisconsin,\n\n20\n00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:49,773\nthat's where I started,\n\n21\n00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:50,654\nand I have my own office,\n\n22\n00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:50,794\nblah,\n\n23\n00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:50,934\nblah,\n\n24\n00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:51,074\nblah.\n\n25\n00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:01,780\nSo,\n\n26\n00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,121\nyeah,\n\n27\n00:01:03,384 --> 00:01:06,670\nI probably should have pulled this plug five years ago and saved all that money,\n\n28\n00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:09,797\nbut there were several times where I thought I might get back into it.\n\n29\n00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,919\nNow I've absolutely positively concluded I can't.\n\n30\n00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:14,700\nAnd,\n\n31\n00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:14,780\nJim,\n\n32\n00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,703\ndoes it mean that my files and all that data is deleted,\n\n33\n00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:20,327\nor is it archived and where a year from now or somebody couldn't come and buy into\n\n34\n00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,248\nbeing able to look at that data?\n\n35\n00:01:31,386 --> 00:01:32,080\nHow does that work?\n\n36\n00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:32,720\nWell,\n\n37\n00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:33,521\nwe archive it,\n\n38\n00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:34,963\nand it's there for about a year,\n\n39\n00:01:35,063 --> 00:01:37,106\nusually a little bit longer than a year,\n\n40\n00:01:37,166 --> 00:01:42,533\nso that if something did happen that you wanted to turn it back on or anything like\n\n41\n00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:44,155\nthat, you could kind of turn it back on,\n\n42\n00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:44,996\nor if you sold it to someone,\n\n43\n00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:45,917\nwe should probably have it,\n\n44\n00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:47,639\nand we could get it and just turn it back on.\n\n45\n00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,981\nif you wanted to request a data return we could make the database the sequel\n\n46\n00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:55,542\ndatabase available for you for download then you could keep it wherever you have\n\n47\n00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:59,004\nand you wouldn't need us you could just give it to someone else they could take it\n\n48\n00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:02,525\nback to PC recruiter or anywhere else yeah well I think it's a assist or the other\n\n49\n00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:04,926\noption is if you need a data perhaps to get a hold of anyone you could push it out\n\n50\n00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,907\ninto a CSV just like export a roll-up list take the data you need from there that\n\n51\n00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,448\nway it's usable but you couldn't really yeah but you could give it some but it\n\n52\n00:02:11,488 --> 00:02:15,109\nwouldn't be the full database it would just be field data well it's so bizarre like\n\n53\n00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,390\nfor example um uh we have because i'm a latin american area specialist there were\n\n54\n00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,752\ndozens and dozens of individuals who were uh in my database for latin america all\n\n55\n00:02:22,772 --> 00:02:23,612\nover and um One of them,\n\n56\n00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:25,933\nI have no way of being able to get a hold of them,\n\n57\n00:02:25,953 --> 00:02:27,193\nthe Fodrejo family in Colombia.\n\n58\n00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:51,529\nAnd the only place I would turn to would be PC Recruiter to dig into that.\n\n59\n00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,211\nI wouldn't even know how anymore to access that right now, this minute.\n\n60\n00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,967\nI wouldn't even know how to get a hold of,\n\n61\n00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:03,348\nyou know,\n\n62\n00:03:03,548 --> 00:03:06,456\ngo in there because I haven't been inside PC Recruiter for five years.\n\n63\n00:03:08,761 --> 00:03:11,648\nI haven't looked at one single contact in PC r",
