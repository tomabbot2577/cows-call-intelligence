    "text": " Hello. Hi, this is Robin. Is this Jodi? Hi, Robin. Yes. How are you? Thank you for calling me back. Good. Oh, yeah. Robin from Main Sequencing. I should say that. Sorry about that. I know who you are. I know the number, the 440. I don't know. Is there a place? I don't think there's a place in PCR where I can change my credit card information. Because what happened was in January, we got a new credit card. And so I haven't updated it. And then we were going to cancel. But then we are closing the doors. But it probably won't be until the end of the year. Okay. Well, then we also changed billing systems, too, just so you know. So any card that you would have had with us, we can no longer use because they're, like, basically encrypted. so let me pull up your information here hold on one second yeah because i'm sure we owe you several months because i'm the only there's only one user it's me okay i'm going to make sure that's correct here too it should be there this gemstone okay let's see yeah we the last payment we received was when we had the old system so what i can so there is a let me make sure okay i think I went through I already took out the late fee because it was probably just not knowing we have this new system so yeah I didn't because until like I answered like until I sent that email which I think you saw right so I was like oh okay so you haven't even been getting paid because I don't do that part of the business that we have an accountant so I didn't know okay so yeah let me just make sure I have all your information right here. So it's accounting at matter wealth. Does that sound right? Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's the accountant. And then my email is joe.sommers at gemstone.com. Let me see if I have that on. Recurring.com. Do I have you? You should, because you emailed me, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't have you as a, Let me add you as an additional recipient, at least, even though it's the main one. So I'm going to add you on the account. She's just the accountant for the company. Okay. So. And I think you're because we were, yeah. I don't know how you got hers, but anyway. I can add yours. Joe. Yeah. It's Joe. Okay. Now, do you want to give me a card? And then just do the auto pay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So I can do that for you if you want. And then what I'm also going to do is I will send you – the only thing is if I send you the customer portal link, it has to be created with whoever is like the two email, which is the accounting one. I don't know if you want it to be yours instead of the accounting one. Yeah, because she doesn't want to deal with this. Okay. Yeah. So I'm just going to replace this with your email then. Because I'm technically the admin. Yeah. technically on the admin on the account so i'm not that does this though okay all right and then we we will close the account at the end of the year so i want that to be noted on there because i didn't even realize i thought we were month to month so when the contract's up i do want the account closed okay so just make sure because it looks like your agreement let me just double check your agreement okay yeah okay so it looks like your agreement term is it goes it goes November 29th to really like that really should be the 28th I don't know where they put the 29th really should be the 28th um so it expires on November 28th or okay so November 29th so just make sure like 30 days before that you reach out with a final decision like yes I want to cancel or no I'm going to continue okay so like I hope I'm going to send an email letting you guys know that I want to cancel right yes because you don't want it or you can reach out like your account manager Jim Lombardo because you don't want it to auto renew either and kind of right now who is my account manager because I don't know Lombardo Okay, Jim. Okay. Okay. So for this stuff, what I'm going to do, are you ready to give me a card now? Yes. Okay. Let me just go to, okay, let me make sure. Double check. Okay. Jim's doing recruiting. Yeah. There should be enough money. I don't know because I don't handle that. Because I don't know how many months you're in the church. Okay. So here's what I'm going to do. Okay. Name on the card. it's Joshua Strip Matter and if you want me to spell it's S-T-R-I-T-T M-A-T-T-E-R okay card number okay it's 4-0-0-5 7-0 I'm sorry 7-1-0-8 0-0-1-2 5628. 5628? Correct. Okay. Expiration month and year? 4 of 28. Okay. And the security number on the back? 798. 798. Okay. And the address is coming up as 101 7th Avenue, Suite 910, Fort Worth, Texas, 76102. Is that correct for the card? Let me make sure because we did switch. Give me one second. I work remotely, so I don't know. They moved their office. Like, here it is. So our new one is, where is it? No, you need to put this address on there. Okay. three three four three okay lock lock l-o-c-k-e avenue okay suite 107 still fort worth the zip is 76107 but the zip code for our credit card is still the um 76102 for some reason. Oh, okay. So if you want to just put the 76102 in as the zip code, do that. Because if it's going to pull that zip code, I don't know why, because we had an issue with, like, LinkedIn right after the year, and this was part of the issue because our credit card is, for some reason, our bank is still using that zip code. Okay. Even though they have the correct address. Okay. He bought a building. Okay. So we want to keep the 102 on the card just to make sure it goes through. Correct. Correct. But the official zip code is the 107. Okay. Because it's a different area of Fort Worth. Okay. I'm going to, like at least in our database, our PCR database, I'm going to put it correct there. But for your card, I'm going to do, you know, the 102. Okay. If you don't do the 102, it won't go through. So we've tried calling the bank. We have to just use that zip code. Okay. So what I'm going to do now then is I'm going to go back to your customer. I didn't change the address on the invoices that are open. I will do that after. It doesn't even really matter. I mean, you can change it, like, after, but it doesn't matter because I don't think you mail us invoices anyway. so we just see it on our credit card statement that we're paying for it. Okay, so I'm going to turn on the auto pay option for you. Thank you. Okay, so right now there is a total of four invoices. It's like 500 bucks around. Yeah, because the August one's in there too. Okay, so it's $479.80. Do you want me to go ahead and try this while we're on the phone? Yeah, try it, because if it doesn't, you can email Jennifer, the one at accounting, and ask her to put $500 in the account. But there should be some money in there. Okay. It kind of takes a moment. Yeah, well, we just had a placement like a couple weeks ago, so I would assume that there's money in there. Thank you. Are you getting anything yet as far as any kind of confirmation email? From you? Let me see. Will it come from billing and main sequence? No. I don't have anything. Okay. Let me see. Where do I go to see those? I'm still getting used to this site. Credit card processing. Nope. That's not really where I go. Credit card processing. Nope, that's not really where I go. Okay. I think they just went through. They went through. You should have four emails saying that the invoices are paid. Okay. Yeah, I'm not worried about it. Let me see. I was not at my desk. Give me one second. Let me go back into my email. I did not have an email from you. Oh, okay. So why is it saying soft email bound? So it's going to say J-O. I wonder if I have this wrong. J-O dot S-U-M-M-E-R-S at gemstonerecruiting.com. Yeah. Why do I have this? Okay. It's bigger, I think. That's exactly what it says. It says what? J-O-S-U-M-M-E-R-S at gemstonerecruiting.com. Yeah. That's right. Let me check my – I don't know. I don't think it would go into my junk mail, but. yeah sing soft bounce it would come from billing at main sequence or main sequence technology so you'll see yeah i know i got nothing it's not in my junk and it's not in my that's weird yeah no i know you guys are called main sequencing um yeah no i don't have an email from you but i'm not worried about it as long as you know we're good and you'll stop sending emails to accounting okay well that one i did okay so i will take that out Like two weeks ago because I, but then I got, I was really sick. I had the stomach flu for a week and a half, so I didn't get to it. And she's like, did you take care of this? I'm like, I am so sorry. I'm like, as soon as I feel better, I'll take care of it. Yeah. I want to know why it doesn't. It might've sent to her because you changed it just now. You know what I mean? It's sent to both. Hers sent, yours soft balanced. Okay. Yeah, what a tough answer. It's really odd. You're not, like, out of office, are you? No. And my email's working. I got email today. Let me see. Yeah. Actually, I haven't had any emails today, but it says my folder's up to date. I'm connected. I'm going to try doing this one more time, see what will happen when I get a paid reminder. I'm just going to open up one of them, the June one. Let me just see what kind of message it gives you. Yeah, it says it's a temporary failure in email, meaning the email was successfully sent to the recipient's email server but was rejected before reaching the inbox. Hmm. Hmm. I don't know. Hmm. Here, let me, because, like, I can reply to you. Oh, it's just going to go to PCR support. Never mind. Yeah. Yeah. They should be coming from billing at main sequence on that. Yeah. Let me see. I don't think I, I'm trying to see if I have any from billing. I've probably never gotten them. Well, billing is going to be new, but yeah, you would not have gotten them before only because, well, you weren't, you didn't have, we didn't have your email in there. It was the JL summers. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I didn't get it. That's okay. It's fine. She got it, so she'll know it's taken care of and we're paid as far as you're concerned. Yes. Okay. That works for me. All right. As long as you're okay with it. And then if you have any questions or anything, just, you know, you can call me and we'll go from there, okay? Yeah, no, perfect. And then I'll just make sure on, like, October 15th, I send a message to everybody and say that I do want to cancel at the end of the contract. Yes. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
