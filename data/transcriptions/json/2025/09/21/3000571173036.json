    "text": " Thank you for calling Survival Systems. This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance. Survival Systems, how may I help you? Hi, this is Garrett. I'm trying to reach Jill. We're in a meeting for PCR. Oh, yes. Just one moment, please. Okay. Okay. Sorry about that. I thought Gabe had set my audio up, but apparently not. No problem. What should I do? I need to get here. All right. So just click the blue share button down at the bottom of the RingCentral meeting. Got it. And select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. You might have to click on like screen one or something to highlight it and then hit share. Okay, there you are. Perfect, I can see that. Alright, so let's jump into PCR and we'll take a look at some of the issues we've been having with the form letters. So do you want to see the error first or what it should look like? Yeah. I have letters that I haven't, the only two letters that I edited are the ones that aren't working. All the other letters are fine. So I can show you what it's supposed to look like. Okay, cool. Okay. I'll just hit record on the screen share here. Perfect. Okay, so I'm going to go to myself and then I'm going to come here and then I'm specific B letter here. okay so these two right here the sss ones are the ones that have the air this here is what it's supposed to look like and then i would enable and then i would fix that format obviously and then change whatever needs to be changed depending on the term for that client okay okay so that's what it's supposed to look like same the autofill right here gotcha okay and this is what it's doing when I edit the letter boom okay word on okay and if you hit yes what ends up happening there that error Okay, hit okay on that. And then you said this happened for brand new letters as well? It was a lot. These two letters right here, they've been in here forever and I've been using them on a weekly basis, but I had to add a paragraph in. So I went to my letters over here and I did here and then I would hit edit and I added the information which was something this paragraph right here and then I hit save and so I went to the next letter did the same thing and then I did like a test and that's when I I experienced the error, so I didn't edit the other four letters because I have to use them. Now I have to go to an old letter and change this and change that, which it shouldn't be that way. Right. All right. And then if you close this out and just edit one of the letters that are working without saving it, I just want to make sure that at the top left it still says Word. I'm going to use this one because that's so, let's see. That's a word. Okay. And that's one of the ones that would probably work. So, yeah, I wouldn't open it. We'll just kind of keep it. Okay. I was just checking this screen. So you could close that. And then go ahead and create a new letter. You said it happens with new letters as well. Yeah, we tried that too, but I can. Oh, I guess we deleted it. Okay. So let's add a new one. and you have to name it first right test see all these test tests right word or should I leave it as HTML for now because it doesn't work with the word right I wonder if let's go to eight yeah go to HTML and let's see if it's having to issue with that setting. Test, test. Okay, so I have to name it first is what it's saying, right? So test, test. Okay, yep. And then I would, let's see. No, it's not going to pull it up because it's a Word document, so I would have to, what, copy-paste maybe, and it looks like crap. Oh, I see. Okay. Headers aren't on there. All right. If you do the download button again at the top, and can you switch it to all files rather than just HTML when you're down at the bottom? Oh, you're right. My bad. Let me get this out of here real quick. Yeah. Okay, let's try that again. Where'd it go? Oh, there we are. Okay, so we're going to go back to the first one. It already exists. Oh. Why is it doing a save as? Okay. I don't get that. Is one of my letters named that maybe? I am not sure. We're trying to download it into PC. But it says C dot. Oh, yeah. I don't think it would be looking at the title of a form letter. Okay. I wonder. Yeah, if you just try to add it again, a new letter, and we'll. Okay. So cancel this. Yeah, that's fine. So I just want to make sure I was following the steps correctly. So you go to the plus sign, and then you're going to do the download button. You don't even have to name it yet. From there? Okay. And then we switched it to all files. Go down to one of the letters. This guy. Okay, it's still doing save as. Hit no on that. Let's make a duplicate of that file and see what the save as thing is about. So if you just want to copy it and like paste it in there again or on your, yeah, there we go. And then hit save on that and it doesn't matter if it makes changes. Go ahead and hit yes on that to the copy. There's nothing in there. It opens an empty file. Okay. Go ahead and close that out. And go ahead and switch it over to Word instead of HTML. we tested out HTML that's not working and then just follow the steps you normally would before editing so I have to save it I don't even know where we're at should I maybe global is that the problem no that's not the problem so should I download again yeah let's try again just the normal steps you would I've tried all of these by the way, these two anyways. Okay, I would do the docx file is the newer, yes, the newer file type. I'll just remember that, okay, because I'll forget. Okay. The one we used. See, it doesn't even let you download anything. Hold on, let me try this again. What was that? Okay, so download. It's not even bringing up any files to download. Oh, I see. So that download button is downloading the current file into your computer. It's not downloading anything from your computer to PCR. Right. What if I were to paste in here? So that would still just be editing a file that's now on your computer. So I see. Okay. So I think that button might be part of the problem. So yeah, that download button is only putting something on your computer. So if you do the edit, yeah, click on the edit. And this will be a blank document. Can I download it from here or just copy and paste it? Try copying and pasting it into that file. Yeah. Copy and paste it into that file. We'll do the copy. Copy, copy, the copy, copy is nothing. Right. OK. So yeah, go ahead and copy that and we'll paste it into that new file that's open. And then hit file save on this. Oh yes, make any changes you need. Hoping it works. I don't think, what the heck, that was never there. Okay. Save, right? Yep. And here it is, letter 309. Excellent. And we'll go back to DCR, click to reload. So that's that. I usually save right there, too. Yeah, that's good. all right so then now we're going to go to the test test one yep see if we're getting the same issue but okay that's fine and dandy but what about this okay I would get this far and And then it's, there's... Yeah, so I have a note from our tech team that says you can't merge PCR field data into a Word doc only to build out of an HTML. That's not true. I just set one for you. Right, okay. It would work forever. Let's see. Are we able to switch that file type to HTML now inside of PCR? If we go to, back to PCR and edit the, oh yeah, it won't let you edit afterwards, it doesn't look like. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, go ahead and you could close. No, no, you could close this. I just meant inside of PCR in that pop-up window at the top left. Yeah, it's not letting you change that. Okay. So, let's see. So let's see. Maybe HTML view? Not sure. And we're in the adding a name letter. We're editing one. We're at the actual letter. Okay. Should I try to save? Actually, go back to where you were going to email yourself the letter. Oh, yeah. Okay. So we're on your name record. We're going to form letter. Perfect. And then. Find the letter you want. Right. And then on that. So if I hit edit, watch this. Oh, sorry. Just kidding. If I hit email, I think it was. If I hit email, it populates information. Yes. Right. But we don't send our fee agreements this way. Gotcha. So we'll close that. So if you, yeah, so it's when you're going to print, when it reopens in Word, it doesn't merge the data into a Word document. Okay. If you do the email and then hit print on that. So there's that option where you can select in the dropdown email. And there's a print button at the top left there. Or a download there. Okay, yeah, so we don't want that. Go ahead and hit cancel there. Try hitting the download button at the top left there. This will download a file to your computer. What am I just picking that letter again? Or no, you're downloading this brand new document onto your computer. So the file name down below is called document. So just put it somewhere on your desktop so we can open that file and check on it after downloading it. As HTML? All files? Yeah, yeah, it's fine. HTML? Yep, fine, it's HTML. Open. Oh, okay, so that opened the folder you had selected, the SSS folder. Maybe just put it on your desktop on the left there if you want to navigate to your desktop. I did, but, oh, there it goes. Okay, so we saved that to, okay, that was saved as an HTML. Click on that document at the top right there and just open it. Okay, so that doesn't work either. It's got that strange formatting. You can close that tab. All right. So, yeah, it looks like the disconnect is the Word document. When you go to print that, when it transfers from PCR into Word, it's not using the insert fields. When you email it, it works, but when you're printing it and opening the file in Word, it's not putting in those. But for just these two letters, the ones that I edited. Gotcha. And a new letter that we've created called test.one. There you go. Yeah. So I will let our tech team know that that is malfunctioning and get back to you as soon as they have any troubleshooting steps. But we've gotten a video of this that I can send over so they can see what's going on. The correct one is the one that I haven't messed with, right, how it pops open. Right. Yeah, you can show that again if you want there. Boom. Right. Okay. Excellent. And it got the first name there as well. Okay. Awesome. All right. I wonder if maybe I could go to this letter, like say I go to like edit this guy and then I grab this and I paste it on our new one. Edit the letter itself. because it's the same information? You could try it and it'll probably end up the same because it looks like it does have all those same codes right in that same spot. Yeah, I wouldn't say that, I'd just close it. Yeah, it's all the same. Insert field codes. Maybe like and just redo these. Like I don't even remember how to do the inserting this information. I don't. Is it within the letter? Yes, it's in the actual building of the letter, but you have them all correct right now. They're exactly typed correctly. So it's a change in the software that needs adjusted with our development team. So, yeah, I'll send them this video and get back to you as soon as I hear more. Thank you. Two tickets open. I'm not going to do any other edits. Right. That's a good idea. I know, but then I have to go back and paste this new verbiage. Right. It's a nightmare. I'm just going to combine our two tickets because they do seem like they are the same kind of issue. And then get back to you as soon as I hear from the tech team. Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks. Have a good one. Bye. You too.",
