    "text": " Thank you for calling Natesecrets Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is JP Wright. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. I have a tech support question. For some reason, we use PCR and Outlook, and we're just starting to implement using SourceWale. and I'm trying to add in something for SourceWale into Outlook. There's a connector like a plugin and for some reason, whenever I click on the add-ins section of Outlook, the only thing it does is brings up PCR stuff. It doesn't give me the option to actually like add anything in like it's supposed to. Are you, so what buttons are you clicking to get to the add-in section inside of Outlook? Are you going to file at the top left and then options? No, it's one of the tabs at the top. Like it goes file, home, send, receive, folder, view, add-in, PCR, and help. Okay, and when you click on PC Recruiter, you're able to see the PC Recruiter stuff. And then when you click on the Add-ins tab, you're saying you're not able to see Source Wheel? Whenever I click on Add-ins, it only shows PC Recruiter Toolbar, MyPCR, Company, Name, Position, Activity, Schedule. Yeah, so that's the PCR Outlook portal that you're seeing there. That's the PCR add-in where you're seeing all the – just basically the main menu items of PCR are up there. And when you click on the word add-ins in the main menu up there, is PCRecruiter also underlined? Because you said it was the second tab right next to it. so there's a there's an add-in tab and then there's a there's a pc recruiter tab as well right okay and if you're clicking on add-ins does the pc recruiter tab kind of get selected and underlined automatically no it's just it underlines add-in oh okay do you want me to just do you want to remote into my computer so you can see what's going on? Yeah, well, I think I understand what's going on. It might be more of a source whale question why their add-in isn't working with Outlook. It seems like the PCR add-in is working. They've already been through this, and they said I need to reach out to you and Microsoft, because whenever I click the add-in tab, it should give me the option to search for add-ins to add, and it's not. It's like PCR has taken over the add-in tab. Okay. There's no other option other than the PCR stuff that's under the add-in tab. Okay, let's get on a screen share. I can look around and see if there's anything that jumps out to me. So if you just want to open a tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Yep. And when you're there it should prompt you for a meeting ID? Yep. Okay that's 687-110-423. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Okay. All right. And just click the mute button at the bottom and then the blue share button at the bottom as well. Awesome. All right. So that is okay. I see. You can click that in. Mm-hmm. Okay. Like, when you click the button, you're supposed to be able – there should be, like, an option to search for apps. Okay. At the bottom right of that gray box, there's a little down arrow. Does that give you anything? No, that's just like toolbar options. Okay. Custom toolbars. Okay. Then go to File at the top left. And go down to Options at the bottom left. And on the left, go to Add-ins. and then hit go at the bottom where it says manage com add-ins so here let me zoom in I'm sure we're reading that okay you have the outlook social connector you have a few Microsoft ones turned on you have PCR if you scroll through that whole list there is there one related to the source whale at all no I can't like I have to search for it from Outlook. They can't just send me the executable for it to add it in manually. The only way that it works is if I follow their instructions, which has me going into here and searching for it. All right. So what I would recommend is deselecting PC Recruiter from that pop-up box that you just saw there. Let's get back to that. go to File, Options, Add-ins, Go, deselect PC Recruiter, and hit OK on the right. And then now PC Recruiter is not turned on, so you can follow their instructions to put in the source whale. and then next time around you could just turn that PC recruiter checkbox back back on after source wheels already installed And now I don't have the add-ins. Yeah, I'm not exactly sure. Do they have anything in their instructions from SourceWale about how to get the add-ins tab to appear? No. It's just supposed to be there. Okay. For some reason. Try going to File again at the top left. And then where it says slow and disabled com add-ins kind of highlighted in yellow, click on that. Okay, telephone plug-in. So I'm not sure what that plug-in is, but that one's been disabled because it's either slow or something's wrong with that one. one. Yeah, I'm not sure how to... I've never used Outlook to search for add-ins with an add-ins tab at the top, but PCRecruiter is not turned on currently, so it's not kind of... you know, it wouldn't be getting in the way of kind of following their instructions. So the next step That might be after turning off PC Recruiter to contact their support and have them show you how to get to the add-ins to install their integration. Yeah. They're not very helpful that way. I went through a whole bunch of things with them and we just couldn't get it to work. I know that I can add it through, like if I have an executable for it, like I can add it this way. Like if I have the file somewhere, I can do it, but they can't give me the executable for it. They said I have to get that from Outlook or from Microsoft for some reason. Oh, okay. so I don't know yeah I'm not sure yeah at least you can if you have the option you do have the option to turn off PC Recruiter so it's not affecting any further attempts so that might be one of the first steps is just turning off PC Recruiter Outlook portal and then going from there with either Microsoft support or SourceWale support okay alrighty Anything else I can help with today? No, that's it. All right. Well, reach out if you need anything else. I will. Appreciate your help. Thanks.",
