    "text": " Hello? Hey, it's me again. How are you? Hey, yeah, good. Okay, we're going to take out this part about, sorry, I'm working on, save drop as template, save as template. Are you looking on the letter? yeah yeah i'm gonna i'm making like a document like each date each amount with a total um do i have your permission to go ahead with that or do you want me to send you one first could you could you send me one because i was thinking we would just have a you know in the letter it would have a list of the of the um the the dates and the and the amount and then we will need to create an invoice in QuickBooks that also kind of mirrors that like we'll have one invoice with one line that says you know January 2024 payment not processed 50 bucks you know the second one February 2024 invoice payment not processed 50 bucks you know so that one invoice will have if it's if they owe 1700 bucks there'll be one invoice in QuickBooks for $1,700 that we could send along with the letter. Here's my problem with that, well my concern. If we're giving options of three months or six months, shouldn't we wait to find that out then create the invoice? Because especially if they're on AutoPay, I don't want to think just automatically processing without them knowing first. Yeah, we would, well, if we put the date, if we, if we set a future date, then it wouldn't, but I see what you mean. Um, and we can, they can always, they can always make three payments on one invoice. Like we don't, we really don't want to create three invoices. We would want to create one invoice where they could make three payments. The only thing is, yeah, I'd rather separate this. I'm a little concerned with the whole not okay. yeah I don't think there's a way to not make an invoice for auto pay and then because I would like to give out future date it they won't go through Biller Genie it only gets sent through Biller Genie once the date the invoice date is there so if you want to go ahead and send the letters that's you know that it has all the details in it but if you don't mind sending me one just so I could yeah he got it okay I'm gonna I'm gonna we could create them as as we contact people or as they contact us and tell us how they want to pay we could create them then you're right we just want to make sure that we have a good list yeah okay I don't like how that was facing hold on one second and I did like the details for a lot of So I'm going to just paste these in and I saved the whole thing as a template. So, okay. So this would be this. Plain text. Okay. Number to March. Copy. I don't like how that pasted in. I made a bunch of line breaks in between. I have a feeling it's partial in me too. It seems like they're all like, not all of them, but kind of around the time that I did it. But then like I look at it and it looks like somebody else did it. One, it was definitely me. Because I see where I took a card. I probably updated the card, didn't check that box. I think it was going to be a cross or something. Okay. So I am clicking send to you on this. Okay, I'm gonna bold that line, I think. Okay, there is one going to you as an example. I had people. I knew my miss I knew the document that I'm starting to create that I'll just like kind of and we'll just kind of keep it on one place Let's see, so we may spread out. I'll say balance over three months. Balance over six. Yeah. So I wasn't sure if they wanted to say you could have six months, but only if your balance was a certain amount or not. I guess I just want to offer that globally, right? Either you can pay it, you know, in three months or six months, no matter what the balance is. What if somebody owes, like, you know, $400 and they want to spread it out over six months? Are they going to let them do that? Considering it's our mistake, I think we should be flexible. Okay. And so, and your, do you have a, do you have the list to make sure that we're, that we put the right, you know, amount to do on everybody? I was going through each one at the right and making sure it didn't, like, it really did a process before I was doing it. Yeah. I was just confirming. So I believe I have the full list. I was going to go off the one just sent today. When it says let's get the letter in amount. So it's from June 23rd. I don't think you add. The one I sent? The one I sent? With the 17 people? Sure. Sure. Okay. Good. Okay. Okay. Let me check your email, for example. email for example and then you will have like the contact information on the bottom yeah that's yeah that's my tablet yeah yeah I have to save it without my signature because otherwise if I kind of save the template with my signature when I go to actually send it it adds it again so yeah that was just the template that I sent you and I just kind of pasted it in. Yep, excellent. Okay. Yep. You're good with that? That's great. Mm-hmm. Okay. All righty. Okay, yeah, good luck. I know they're going to get lots of calls, but, I mean, they didn't get charged. Yeah. And if they can prove it somehow, then go ahead and prove it. Right. But, yeah, it didn't come this way. Well, it has to be better than what I heard the other day. What? You're an older woman like I am. What do you think is probably the worst? I'm 55. Come on. Okay. So our generation, what is the worst word you could ever call a woman? I would never. I don't even say it. It begins with a C. Oh, that's yucky. Yeah. Somebody got an invoice that it was overdue, and they wrote back, you know, the full word. They wrote back, this person died on this date. And I said, oh, I'm sorry to hear about her passing. I said a simple explanation would have been sufficient, you know. Yeah. I mean, if you're going to reply back that. So then I think, oh, I think it was on the first one. Well, then there were remind, I don't know, then something reminder. Oh, he wrote back. Oh, no, he wrote back to me. He wrote F off C word. I'm like, wow. That's obnoxious. And it's coming from the person that's being invoiced. Like, I don't know. Couldn't you just say something like, I know that was like my start. Was it Monday morning? I'm like, ew. I'm like, just delete the email, move on with my life. What's wrong with you? I know. What's wrong with you? People are like, I'm telling people are crazy. I don't like these younger people. They're just not. Hmm. That's not. Well, I don't. Somebody, somebody's mama didn't raise them right. I mean, I mean, you need some anger management or something. If you can just mouth off like that to somebody you don't even know. I mean, for, I mean, who, who, you know, pooped in your reading today? You know, I'm like, what in the world? you know I know I mean I'm like I mean I really wrote in there like you know a simple explanation would have been fine I'm just doing my job you know yeah invoice we had no idea of knowing the circumstances and then I think I closed out the simple would have been enough yeah and that was I got a second F you with the other word I'm like oh my god what is wrong with people yeah yeah That's just uncalled for. Yep. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. It would have been nice if you had learned some manners. Yeah. Yeah. Your parent needed to beat your ass. I don't even say it. I think I kind of said it when I was talking to Jim Lombardo. Like, I can't believe I got an email that said that. And I'm like, oh, my God, I can't believe I even said it, like repeating it. I don't even say the word. no yeah okay well um yeah um let me know if you have any other trouble but i think i think that would be good okay sounds good thank you so much uh-huh you're welcome have a good night you too okay bye",
