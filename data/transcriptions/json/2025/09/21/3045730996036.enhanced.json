    "text": " We're calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Eric with Spruce Street Recruiting. Hi, Eric. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. I'm good. I'm just getting to email. I guess something changed with your billing? Yes. And then we had like somehow your email domain was spelled wrong. And then I'm like, okay, that's why it's bouncing. You're not getting the new invoices. Yeah. Yeah, the R was missing, I noticed. I'm like, okay, that's why. All right. Yeah, it said like Spruce Street recruiting or something like that. Okay. So was that normally on like auto pay? You guys had a credit card? Yeah, but we switched billing systems is what happened. And all that stuff's encrypted. You can only see like the last four numbers. It's not like all the details. So with the new billing system, you have to put in your card details. again. Okay. I'm pulling up your account information here. Hold on one second. Let me see what you got. I'm in that invoices window now. Okay. And I guess payment method. I guess I can add a new card here. Yeah, you can put a card in there. You can set it up for auto pay. There's currently three. Your May, June, and July 22nd invoices. Okay. I think one of them We had a late fee, but I already removed that. I just double-checked it. Okay. Thank you. All right. So enable auto-pay for future. I'll do that. Okay. Save. And, okay, it looks like I can just select all here. Yeah, launch. I didn't do that, and then I can confirm if it, like. Okay. It looks like you have the auto-pay on now. That's good. Yeah. All right. So $265.98. Okay, it looks like it went through. Yep. And then what it will do now with the new system, like when you make your payment, it also sends you a receipt too. Okay. Okay. All right. Big upgrade for us. We're very excited about it. It's just, it was a rough transition. Yeah. Honestly, I had no idea. I forgot like if I paid annually or quarterly. I honestly couldn't remember. Yeah. And the problem was like somehow the email was in there. So you probably weren't like getting anything. It was just, you know, you probably sat on your card and thought everything was good. So it was a good catch in my mind. Okay. They're showing it's paid now. So you're all set. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. Have a great weekend. You too. Bye. Bye. Thank you.",
