    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Secret Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi. Good afternoon, Garrett. My name is Jack. I'm calling from Pace Butler Corporation. You actually may be able to answer this for me, but I was looking to speak with Michael Snyder, but the reason for my call is to see, one, if he's still a good point of contact, to, we purchase retired inactive devices such as cell phones, tablets, and such forth from businesses, schools, and other organizations. Would you happen to know if Michael's still the point of contact for management of those types of devices? I don't think he is. He's kind of retiring from the company in a few weeks here. So I see I'll send you over to I'll just transfer you over to my supervisor. His name is Nick. He might be able to help you. We are we just transitioned to fully remote. So I don't know if we'll really have any devices to give send your way anymore. But I'll send you over to Nick to see if there's anything awesome he can answer for you. OK, thank you so much. But. All right. Transferring you to Nick now.",
