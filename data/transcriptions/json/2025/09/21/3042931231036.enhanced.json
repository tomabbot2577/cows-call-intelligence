    "text": " This is Deneen. Hi Deneen, this is Robin Mancini with Main Sequence. How are you? Hi there, good. So are you in the CFO's today? Good, let me see. I think you are one that I had emailed about a card expiring. Which email do you have on file for me? Well, let's see. I should have sent this to Charlotte at CFO Selections. Yeah, that wouldn't come to me. What did I email then? Hold on one second. Did I email you? No, I know. So Charlotte received a bill saying that it had been unpaid, but I don't want to pay in the account. So I don't know if you're able to have more than two emails. If not, it's fine to keep it the way it is. Okay. So I had also done some emails telling people that their cards expired. So that, I might have confused it with that. Okay. So, well, let's see. Autopay. Yeah, it is on. So what I could do, what should be the email associated with the billing? Do you want me to change that? Yeah, if you could change it to me, that would be great. Okay. Then it would be Deneen at CFO Selection. It's the same, but just my first name instead of Charlotte. Okay. Bear with me one second. CFO Selection. I don't think I have it in here. Okay, just to make sure I have it right, how do you spell your first name? V-E-N-I-N-E. Okay. And what is your last name? Vaja, V-A-J-J-A. And what is your email address? D-E-N-I-N-E at CFO selections. Okay. So should I, for the billing, replace that as well, right? Just the billing. Yeah, just the billing, nothing else. Sure. Still the admin for the account. Okay. I'm just changing it for that. Okay. And then, let me see, your stored payment method. I can only see some things of it. 64-68, but it expired June of 2025. Okay, so let me delete. Sorry, actually, hold it on. Before I delete this, I have to turn off auto pay. Let me turn that off. Okay. Now I can go to stored payment method. And can I replace a card? I can delete and then re-add. Okay. So let me start. Okay. And you're in the U.S., right? Correct. Yes. Bellevue, Washington. Some of the people got to keep asking. Okay. What is the name on the card? Ganeen Baza. And it was B-A-J-J-A, right? Correct. Okay. And the card number? 5553-6114-5233-6468. And the expiration month and year? June of 2029. 69. And then the security number? 614. And what is the address associated with a card? It should be this one, 3150 Richards Road. 150? Yes. Okay. And then 98005? Correct. It looks like it was the same information. Okay. All right. So that part stayed, or at least automatically populated, whatever it's doing. Okay. So I'm going to do that, and then go back over here. Okay, so now they have the new card. I go back, and you want auto pay on, right? Yeah. Yes, please. Okay, got that on. And you do have, let's see, how many invoices here? It's just one, one invoice for 680. Should I go ahead and process that now? Yes, please. Okay. Okay. Make sure it goes through. Okay. All right. I think it went through. Let me just confirm. It takes a moment. Can you get an email of anything, right? No, I'm not. It doesn't look like it processed yet. Nothing yet, but our system is really finicky. We'll probably grab it and throw it in quarantine. I'm not showing it. Let me see. Can I go? Sometimes it takes a moment. It's like I'm just impatient. We always expect technology to be immediate too, right? Right. Like sometimes it's super fast. Okay. Yeah. Now it's showing. Okay. I never know the timing on it. Sometimes it takes a little bit longer than others, it seems like. Or at least just sync up and show me. Okay. Yeah, it is. Everything's now current. Oh, yep. And I got an email. Perfect. Yeah. Awesome. That part should happen automatically. You got one? Yep. Okay. You're all set. Thank you so much. All right. Bye.",
