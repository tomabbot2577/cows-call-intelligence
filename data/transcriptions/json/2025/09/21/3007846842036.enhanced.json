    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Alex Lija. I am David James's assistant from Talent Strategies. I just wanted to call and make a payment for his invoice. Okay. Let's see. Should be able to do that all online now. okay I just received the invoice and I don't see a link so is there a view and pay option in there um not an invoice that I've received okay let me see um talent strategies okay let me try it sending it to you um yeah yeah there should be like a green view and pay option in there okay i just he forwarded to me to pay it so i i just have the invoice let's see oh he did like the attachment portion maybe uh no yeah like all i got all i received was the attachment oh okay so that's probably why um actually he has auto enabled hold on one second here this is what is this invoice bear with me one second i want to check something here. Why? Hold on. Okay, so you have five users, right? Yeah. You have five users now? Yes. Okay. I wonder why it didn't do auto-pay. We do have auto pay enabled. I wonder if that was... Do you want me to just do it with like... Because I have the option click here to auto pay. Do you want me to do that? Sure. Could you tell me what card you have on file with the auto pay? That could be part of... Yeah, it looks like Visa ending in 8308. Yes, and that we would like to change that. Okay. so let me see can I do all of this add a story card um okay here's what's probably better because I don't think I have enough to do it with the auto pay we could try it what's the name on the card uh David James okay And what is the card number? It is 4246-3154-3970-0020. Okay. And the month and expiration? 0330. And the CVC number? 076. 076. Okay. And is it 2150 Palomar Airport Road, Suite 204, Carlsberg, California? Yep. Is that also correct? Okay. We're going to add card. Okay. Let me see here. Can I do it for auto pay for you? Invoices. Okay. and wait the 0020 right? Mm-hmm. Okay first name David James okay and what was that CVV number? 076. I can create this transaction. Email receipt. Okay. Okay. So what I'm going to do for you, though, is go over to your customer area. And I'm going to send you – it'll have to do with his email address because that's tied to it. and bear with me. Customer portal, send invitation. Okay. So I'm going to send this invite to our new customer billing portal. And what he'll want to do is click sign up to create an account. And once he does that, he can go in and there's a vault area that he can click on. and what he can do is take out the other card. If you don't want to use that going forward for auto pay, he can delete it. Okay. And then the one card that should be in there now, you could set that one up for auto pay. Gotcha. But that way he could also go in at any time and look at his invoice and things like that. Gotcha. Okay. So then that invoice got paid, but then to change the auto pay going forward. Yeah, that way. Yeah. With the new billing system, you guys can manage it on your own instead of having to, like, call us and, you know, I need to change my card, which is really nice. And I am so sorry. I did not catch your name so I can write to who I have to talk to. Sorry. You're good. Alex Leja. Oh, here it is. Oh, there it is. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, so it's in the vault area. So when you get that link, if he hasn't done it yet, he'll want to click sign up or create an account. I forget how it's worded. I feel like it's worded differently in two different places. But if he creates an account, then once he's in, then he can go to the vault area and change the card. Okay. Okay. Because it might have both stored right now, but the other one is probably the one for auto pay. And then it has to be kind of done by your side to approve it. Okay. Okay. I'm going to work on that right now. All righty. Well, thank you so much for calling. Awesome. Thank you for your help. Oh, you are welcome. Have a great week. Have a great rest of your day. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye.",
