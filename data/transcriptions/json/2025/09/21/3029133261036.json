Just giving you a call back back making sure you have questions about your user changes answered. If you still need assistance just let us know. I'm actually pulling up your information. I should have done this before I was leaving a message for you.

Hi Tom this is Robin Montoni following up I know you had some questions about user changes just want to make sure that you're all settled now we did adjust your billing from 2 to 3 users so that'll be reflected on your next invoice scheduled for August 11th so if your user account ever changes you just let us know and then we adjust your billing so it's not based on how you add or delete in the database, you would actually have to let us know. So let me know and we will go from there and hope you have a wonderful weekend if I don't hear from you. Thanks.",
