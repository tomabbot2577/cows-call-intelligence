    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I've got a custom field set up for job title and PC recruiter. And how do I remove some of those names out of there I want to get rid of? I forgot how it works out in the database. I know it's under system. Okay, yeah. Go to system up at the top and then custom fields on the left. Okay. And then choose which category of custom fields is for company records, name records, candidate. Okay, yeah. So go to name custom fields on the right. And then in the bottom frame, you'll see all of your custom fields. If you want to adjust those default values that appear or that specific one, you just go to. That's not what I'm looking for here. Oh, okay. Position custom fields, maybe? Yeah, most likely. If it was a job title, that makes sense. I don't see the drop down or any of those names I got in there. When you click on position custom fields in the bottom frame, are you seeing the name of the custom field listed? It's title, contact title maybe. Okay, so here, let's do this. So if you go to, there's probably a different spot that this lives. So if you go to system again at the top, and then on the left, go to database setup, about the fifth or sixth option down. Yep, I got it. And then title is on the far right. far right after you click on database setup you should see titles on the right titles um database management no database setup database setup yep i don't see title um it should be in the third column um that starts with oh i see it now i see it now garrett okay title perfect and And down below, are those the ones you're looking to adjust? Maybe. It just has one in there. I can't see any more than one. Oh, that means that's the only one in there. Here, I'll log into your database and try to find it. All right. Sorry, Gary. No problem. Let's see. Okay, logging in. See if I can do that thing. Got it. All right. So which field is it? Am I pulling up a name record then? If you pull up a name record, it should say job title. That's where the dropdown's at, Garrett. That's why I'm trying to get rid of some of those names I don't need in there. Okay, yeah. We might have been in the right place here the first time around. So if you go to System again up at the top, Custom Fields on the left. And then on the right, go to Name Custom Fields. And Job Title should be listed down below in the bottom frame there. I think it's number 16. I see job title. Okay, I see it. It's got 16 in there. So that's the 16th one. So you go all the way to the right where it says default values and click on that. Okay, there we go. And that will open up your list. Sweet. Appreciate it, Garrett. That's what I needed, man. Awesome. All right. Thank you, guys. Bye. Great job. If you need anything else, bye. All right.",
