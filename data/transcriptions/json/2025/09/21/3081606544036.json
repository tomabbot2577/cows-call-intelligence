    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm new to this program, and I need help with – I can bring up the timesheet information, but I can't print it in, like, a CVS file. Oh, okay. so you want to print out a timesheet. What's your name and what company are you with? I'm T. Green, and I'm with PVS Staffing. PV, sorry, say that again. PV what? PVS Staffing. Okay. Peter, Boyer, Sam, yes, Staffing. Got it. All right. So I'm going to open up your database here on my end. I'll just follow along here. All right. So if you go to, in the main menu, go to contract up at the top. Right. And then go to hours below that. And then choose the week you want to look at. Okay. So this is. Oh, sure. I want to actually a period. I don't want just a week. So, like, I need it from 7-23-2020 to, like, 7-23-2021. Is that possible? Oh, okay. Instead of week by week? Let me see here. Search date. Signed. Huh, interesting. Yeah, it's not – I don't think we – for some reason, we don't have a way to do beyond just a week by week. Let me go to some of these other tabs, though. Here we have assigned. It's showing me everybody that's been assigned currently. Is that available? All would be assigned and available. Okay. Are you looking for the timesheets for a specific person or just all timesheets in that time frame? All timesheets in that time frame because I'm meeting them for this workers' comp audit. And so this report shows me the client that they work for and the hours that they work and the location. So that's why I was trying to bring that up. Okay. I wonder if I can find a report. Yeah, let's see. Contract temp reports. Timesheet profit. Timesheet summary. Let's try this one. This is just a current week again. Filter. Okay. So I found a report that you can run where it will show the company name, the job title, the person who was placed at that company, so the candidate that was placed, their name, and the placement date. But beyond that, it doesn't have, like, the hours that they worked. The only way I could find, even in report... Oh, would that work? That's fine. The company, the job title, and the date. Yep, that's fine. Oh, okay. So to run that report... Because the job title is here. That's what I need. Okay. Oh, good. Okay. So, yeah, in the main menu of PCR, go to reports. And then see on the left, there should be a category called contract temp reports. If you're not seeing it, let me know. You might not have permissions turned on for your username to see those. I see company reports, name, position, pipeline reports, placement reports, auditing, EOC reports, contract temp reports. Yeah, Contract Temp Reports is the right category on the left. Okay. And then on the right? On the right, yeah, Contract Place Reports. Click on that, and you'll see under the first heading, it says Search Params. You'll have a date range that you can put on the right. And this would be – Oh, I'm sorry. Go back. Go back. Hold on. On the new Contract Place Reports? I was trying to write to contract place reports. That's what you say. Yeah, exactly. OK, got it. Right. And then select interview appointment date range should be on the right there for you where you're actually choosing the when it says interview appointment date. It means the date that they were placed since this is like a placement report. So you could put in that date range. I did see that and I was like, no, this is just an interview report, but okay. Yeah, it's just a funny name for it. Interview has to do with anything, any movement into a position. So that's fine. There are filters below under the heading that says filters. If you want to narrow it down by a certain company or a certain job or a certain person, those are available but they're optional you don't have to use them and then once you put in the date range you should see at the top right of your screen like three horizontal lines that says options if you hover over it would be probably underneath your profile picture okay okay yeah Yeah, but it's on the left. Oh, it's on the left. Now I see it's on the right. Okay, I can move it to the right. So click on options. Exactly. And it'll give you all the different ways to export it if you want to export it as an Excel file. Or if you just want to preview it, I always click on the one called PDF view mode. That'll show me like a preview of it before actually saving it as like an Excel file. Okay, so this is where I only can see the PDF view mode or help. There is no Excel. Oh, there isn't. If you click on the three horizontal lines there, it doesn't leave Excel. Okay. It might be that your permissions are turned off to export information. Let me double check that. Let's see. T green is your username. Okay. And oh, you should be able to... oh, you're not... yeah, your exporting reports is turned off. So you would probably need your system administrator, someone on your team to give you that permission. But I'm supposed to be administrator because she set me up... She copied her access yesterday. The Tgreen username is not given the system administrator access currently. They would have to adjust that. And I could write up instructions for your team member to go in and adjust your security permissions. Can you do that, please? Does that help? Yeah. Let me write those up and I'll just send them to you in an email. What's your best email address? It's tgreen at pbsstaffing.com. Perfect. All right. Yeah. Let me get those together. So basically you want your permissions to match the system administrators. and I could throw in there the specific security permission that allows exporting of reports just if they want to narrow down on that as well. Okay cool. Yeah and once that is set you'd be able to export that as a CSV file but if you in the meantime want to click on PDF view mode it'll show you kind of a preview of what the report will look like to make sure that's giving you the data that you want to see? Job title, position ID. It doesn't say that time period, though. You know, like, it just says date posted, but I needed, like, the pay period, too. okay um so yeah in the dark gray box it's showing you everything about that position like what the company was the job title and then below it in the white boxes it shows um the person who is being placed and the date that they're placed um but so yeah you're saying you want their time sheet like you want each time sheet for each week they worked in total? Yes. OK. I don't think we have a report that will show that. It's just going to show week by week when you run in a report. It won't be in such a wide date range. But let me check with my team and see if maybe there's a custom report we could run run or if somebody has requested this before, maybe we've already built a custom report. But yeah, in the meantime, this is as close as we can get with a report that already exists, just showing you the placement dates in that date range. Yeah, if you could see, if you could find that for me, because that's really important. I need that. okay cool yeah I'll see what we can do and I'll get back to you at tgreen at tbsstaffing.com yes awesome okay thank you a lot okay good I will talk to you soon okay thank you bye bye",
