    "text": " okay so oh the Ben Williams probitis or probitis oh yeah they're doing the rename and all of that I want to reign them in though because this is somebody I just want to give you a little backstory sure this is somebody that it took jim wise two months to schedule his consulting call because the guy just you know he doesn't reply you know things like that one of those all of a sudden i want to do everything kind of exactly now he was given 16 hours and used three of them and they're expired and he's like oh i didn't know they expired yeah and then garrett said well that's in the recap and you get this and that, you know, you get all these alerts now automatically. Plus it's at the bottom of the recap, but he's also been suspended twice for non-payment. Okay. So it's just for a little while, like I'm not even following up the schedule because you need to pay. I'm trying to get you to pay. He would like, and like, now he's going to be like, oh, I need this, this, this. But when me and Patsy were chasing him down for payment, missing in action. That's good to know. Yeah. It took him a while to get back to me too. So yeah, I'll just know that he's not a big rush. He is. So don't do anything extra other than job board. Yeah. He went to Jim Lombardo. I don't, I didn't know about all this and kind of, you know, what? So we don't want to do anything extra. What we're going to do, Nick's going to do is tell him, we'll give you half the hours. We're not giving you 13 hours because you failed to follow up. Right. Okay. I even think seven is too much to give them. Yeah. Because it's on you. Yeah. You were asked, are you ready to schedule? You were asked to pay your bill. I would say no. My vote was no. Yeah. They can buy training. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. I mean, because on my side, basically all I was doing was just waiting for them to be done renaming the account and then I was going to give him, you know, just kind of throw the setup together because he, I think he filled out the consulting form and everything. I just don't have anything to put up for him yet. But I felt like there's a little comment about timesheets. Don't do anything. Oh no. All I was talking about timesheets is I was just going to give him the short code for it because he said he was going to use it. I'm like, okay, well I can give you the code that you would need for it. Yeah. So now he's like, oh, I need all my users set up on email, which he just went from five to three so who are these three people that don't have email yet right you know what i mean there's a lot of questionable shit like is he just dropping to three i think i checked their database like i want to make sure we're going to give him some of his hours back okay but not but not all that he didn't use yeah um but i don't want us doing anything unless it's tracked like against time obviously job board we don't count that so that's one thing but if you start saying oh what about doing this for me what about doing that for me say like just tag me in the text kiss my ass yeah yeah um because we're also we're gonna we're gonna i guess nick's gonna create a ticket and he's gonna write in the ticket that the time that we let it has to be scheduled it has to be committed to like we're not going to let this go on and we're going to cap it off it like you'll get six or seven hours whatever it's going to be You have to use them within two months, and your bills have to be current. You're like, we're putting some rolls down because – Yeah. We suspended or threatened to suspend them twice. I think one time we definitely did. Oh, okay. That's good to know. And then he was mad because he went into the biller's gene. He had like five invoices, and I'm like, you're suspending. You're getting suspended. Yeah. I mean, I was nicer about it. Yeah. And he's like, well, I need to have this. I'm like, you need to pay at least two today. Yeah. It was already like, you got to pay by this Friday. And it was after the Friday. He's like, I really need this on. And, you know, are you going to suspend me? I'm like, yeah, I'm going to. Unless you pay two, you got to pay at least two today. Well, when he went in, it paid four of the five. And because he, I don't know, whatever happened. So then he was mad. And it's like, what do you have to do? Oh, it's the money. Anyway, and then it locked his card because the last one got declined or something like that. So he was mad. it's like well you owe the money anyway you know oh boy i'm gonna mess today's like you're locked you know you're the charges locked my card it's like that's what's you and your bank i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you about that one but you owe us for five months right now right oh boy yeah so that's the kind That's a story. So I just want to – in case he tries to push for more. We want using time and once that time is over and once in two months, billable. Fortunately, I mean basically he just – I look out with him and he just wants like dead simple job boards. So there's really nothing too crazy with it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, so now what he asked for is more like what he might ask for. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, I made myself a note in the ticket to not give him anything beyond what he needs. So it's good to know that he's that kind of guy. Yeah. To become problematic. Yeah. Unrelated, Kathy replied back to me with some additional tweaks to that email that I was drafting. Okay. I wasn't sure what the overall plan was for that, whether you were going to be sending that or the – where is that going? I'm going to have to. but I'm going to go through a cafe's email I'm going to have to cut I'm going to have to customize each one that one sure like the middle of it with yeah here are the months you weren't charged it was this amount this amount and I mean you could put that stuff in a spreadsheet and then you know and merge it each customer is different and it's not really easy from what I I mean here's what's really weird do you have access to QuickBooks I think you do right I do not sadly oh okay I thought I was screen sharing with Bill, but I don't have a login for it. He was giving me access to his laptop. Gotcha. Okay. So the way it used to be when people wanted auto pay, Piazzi would set them up with what's called a sales receipt, where you could store a card and you have to click this process card button. Right. Well, some of those, but one was me, probably thinking that you didn't want to process right now, right at the moment. One was me. The other ones, I think there were others, either Liz or Patsy, where the box was not checked. So what sales receipt does is it just sends them a receipt. But it looks like it's paid. It's like sales receipt, and it just shows it's paid even though the card was never attempted is what happened. I see. Interesting. So I was trying to explain it to Bill. He's like, well, how does this happen? I go, apparently that checkbox is what actually processed the card when it's on the day that it's supposed to process, but it just sends them a receipt whether it processed or not, which is why even if it said like failed, like if it was like declined or something like that, you would see a notice. But for these, we would never notice because it just looks like every other one they did. Right. So we went over the thing and see that they'd never even tried to process a card. So it's basically like walking up to a Starbucks counter and then saying, here's your receipt. Now give me your card. But I never handed my card over. So that's what happened with some of those customers. Yeah. They were never really processed. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds about like what Bill was describing. Yeah. So I never knew because it looked normal, and I didn't really know enough about it. Sure. So that was quite a shocker. Good find on her part. Yeah, definitely. That email is not going to go over well with a couple of them because some of them – No, probably not because – well, but hey, they've been getting shit for free. So what are you going to do? So it's not like I can really pull a report like who didn't – like what sales receipt – like it has a sales receipt but no process. I don't think there's a report for that because there is no transaction to track. Right. We're just sending a receipt, assuming that all is well. Yeah. It looks like they're going to think it was paid, but you know, it's also done there. They never, you know, said, Hey, they don't have any records. Right. Yeah. And they, and they probably wouldn't have, you know, who's, who's looking over their card receipts that thoroughly anyway. God knows we weren't for 20 years. So. Yeah. So what I'm going to have to do is that email that she sent is really kind of go through each one. Because hers is like general. They weren't charged from this month to this month. Well, I want it more itemized. You weren't charged on this date, this date, this date. Because they're going to have to check their card statement. And if they can prove I did, great. But if not, we're going to have to send them an invoice. Yeah. And Bill's like, I think we should just send them an invoice. And I'm like, no. You want a great way to piss people off and lose customers. That's, you know. I say we put in the options. We can send you something where you break it up over six months, a year. Six months or a year is a suggestion. If we don't hear from you, we're going to send you one invoice, which is also really super dangerous because they have since set up auto pay. Then you got a problem. Yeah. Because then you're doubling them up. Well. if you just send them one invoice for $4,000 that tries to go against their card yeah nasty we're going to have to give them time to research it and then that's why I put like I'm giving you this email but we'll follow up with a call just so you can have the details like that we're not just like hey sending an email and that's it but we'll call too but just so you have the data if you want to look at it is really what I wanted to say in there. Yeah. Initial thing in case they want to. So having said that, do you think it kind of expresses that pretty well? Yeah, I think so. Okay. What did she change about it? Just minor stuff. Just mostly just wording. Your payment method on file was not charged rather than the charge may not have gone through. Stuff like that. The only real substantial thing she said, she suggested making it spread out the payments over three months or six months rather than six or 12 because she said I wouldn't extend it more than six months because they've already received months of unpaid services at this point. I agree with that and the other thing too because if we are spreading it out over time agreements are only a year. Yeah so but other than that it was pretty simple so what I'll do is I'll take her her edit and clean it up and send it back to you. Okay. And then you can do with it you please but i mean if you are just like filling in the blanks on these things you could put them into a google sheet and then you can do a mass uh do you know how to do bulk mail out of google um google has a merge feature if you've got a google sheet with stuff you can do a you can do a mail merge from google yeah i just i gotta look in quickbooks to get the details of each one that didn't and the only way they can do it is looking at um yeah well that's true if you're If you're looking them up one at a time, you could send the mails one at a time. I mean, it's not like there's thousands of these. Yeah. But I was just saying, if you wanted to do it that way, you could put all of this stuff into a Google Sheet as you go. And then once you're done, just send it as a mass of email. I might do that just so I have it later. Do you know what I mean? Yep. I got to figure out how to do that, too, only because I'm going to have to go back later and make an invoice. Yeah, and flag which ones you got. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, maybe do that. And yeah, because once you've got that, like if you're in the Gmail screen, there's a there's a one of the buttons at the bottom of the editor. I don't know where they have that. I know I've used it in the other Google business. Even if I do it like in like a Google, like like anything, I'm going to have to save it separately just so I have a reference of each detail. And when I create the invoice, I'm going to have to email it. Oh, there it is. Next to the BCC and the CC in Gmail, there's a little icon that's like a couple of people with a plus. Oh, you know what? Yeah, you know what? I don't want to do it that way either. Okay. Only because BCC emails don't write everything. No, no, no. This isn't a BCC. It's just it shows up next to the BCC in Gmail. There's a little button there that's like a couple little people with a plus, and that says mail merge. And then you like pick your spreadsheet and you pull your columns. Oh, I see. Got it. Got it. Yeah. So and I use that sometimes for like if I need to send a small scale mail myself, like when I like when I was a room parent for Hux's second grade, like I had a spreadsheet of all the other parents and then I could just do a quick mail merge out of Gmail. So for little things like this, if you're trying to drop data into the same mail for a bunch of people, it's a really useful way to do it if you're not doing it out of a mail merchant PCR as a form letter or something. Although for this purpose, putting it in as a form letter might make sense, but then you'd have to stick all the data in PCR, which doesn't make sense. So as long as you're IMAPed, then you could do it this way from your Gmail account and drop shit in and it would still write the activities. so that would be the simplest thing to do is just spreadsheet up you know what their dates and amounts are and then yeah i don't know maybe helpful maybe not i don't yeah but i don't know i'm not looking forward to this one yeah i'm sure it's gonna be i got called i got called the c word last week oh boy wow that's i mean like oh god you guys I don't pull that one out lightly I okay that is not a thing I pull out lightly right um so wait who is it Patricia Morrison must have passed away okay um okay where is it going to be it's going to be in my inbox but we don't know and so I sent wait hold on one second oh gosh wait you're going to die when you see this email I'm like oh this is lovely you're going to see this email oh my god so they get an invoice saying it's overdue. And this person who must have access to her email, whoever it is, Patricia Morrison passed away on November 12, 2024. Fuck off. Wow. So then I write back. I write back, I'm sorry to hear about Patricia's passing. That said, your response was uncalled for. We were simply doing our job by following up an unpaid invoice. and had no way of knowing the circumstances, a straightforward explanation would have been entirely sufficient. Now, writes back, fuck off, cons. Wow. Like, I probably would have been nicer in tone if they didn't write F off. You know what I mean? So, yeah. Could I have like just said, oh, sorry, but we'll take care of it. But no, don't say F off. Who does that? So then write that. I mean so I was I think it was to Nick I said I'm just I go I'm not even going to reply to this I'll just close it down whatever I kind of want to keep getting invoice like reminders but like who writes that I mean what kind of miserable person are you I mean, granted, maybe the person died. I mean, you know, so-and-so passed away. Like, we get those emails from time to time. That person isn't here anymore. They're dead. You know, okay. You don't need to be insulting to me. I didn't know. Yeah. It's really like we didn't know. We're just kind of doing our job. Simple explanation. Like, hey, you know, they owed us money. What are you going to do? Oh, can you believe that? Good times. Yeah. I'm like, oh, wow. I think it was one of the first. Oh, yeah, because they sent it 10-14. So that's how I started my morning. Yeah. It was so great. It's going to be one of those days. Yeah. Jesus. Yeah. They sent it like at 10 o'clock at night. Wow. So I was like, okay, I'm just going to move on with my happy life that they don't have, apparently. Yeah. What a miserable. Yeah. Yeah, right? Wow. I'm like, sorry for your loss. I would be. If you weren't such an ass. Yeah. I didn't know her, but I hope you're nicer. Geez. Ow. Unnecessary. All right. Well, I will jazz up this thing, and then I'll send it back to you. I've got her tweaks and I'll just clear out her commentary and give you the official repeated version. Yeah, I just got fine. Yeah. Time to work on it. And she was like, you know, maybe give them, you know, three to four weeks to respond. And then when you're setting your, you know, your back biceps and such a date, yeah, before we charge them. So. Crazy. Yeah. I mean, you know, the fuck up is the fuck up. What are you going to do? Yeah. One was me, that's for sure. Yeah. You know, at least we're telling them and not just letting it rip. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. All right. Talk to you later. Bye.",
