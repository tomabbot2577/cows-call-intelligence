    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, this is Sharon Reed with Brightleaf Group, and I am getting ready to pay the invoice that I received yesterday. However, we have canceled one of the users. So could I get a new invoice? Of course you can. And then I will call you and give you our banking information so we can get this done. yeah so like we switched we call it you switched billing system so you get invoiced annually is that correct so how many users you have six now okay one of them was canceled yeah okay did we if we did a ticket I'm just gonna do a ticket it's just for reference later. Bear with me one second. OK, so I'm going to do new ticket, share and read. Okay, so we're going to remove users. We're removing Bill. What's his last name? I can't even remember now. Bill Jarvis. We're removing one, so you're going to go to six, okay? Yes. All right. Okay. under six users. Okay. Remove Bill Jarvis, right? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to just do that for tracking here for one second. Okay. Let me bring up your stuff here. Right, Lee? Okay. Okay. so the existing invoice dated 7-1-25 we're going to change that one to 6 users let me find out what that monthly is remember when they would tell us you had to know math because you would never rock around with a computer like a calculator in your pocket at least I just aged myself there didn't I so 6 times $49.95 so your new monthly would be $299.70 times 12 prepayment discount what was your prepayment discount it was $209.79 79 cents yeah what was that what would that be of the original amount um oh I you know oh you're gonna ask me that hold on hold on let me uh let me see if there's anything really okay well it wouldn't have been basically I would assume it's five percent okay 0.01 times five percent five percent would be a hundred and ninety nine dollars and thirty cents oh wait a minute would it be that the discount would be off the 41 i'm wrong hold on one second with the original amount but i just changed my amount times well you just wanted to know what this was from five percent would have been that's right That's 5%. Okay. I'm going to add that in there so that it's clear so that I don't have to ever look at that again. Okay, so the new discount would be $35.96 times $4.00. Should I have got that right? Yep. Times .05. 179.82. Okay. And that did lower it. OK, so six users at $49.95. OK. Okay, save this. Now are you in that customer billing portal or what are you in right now? Oh, no, I'm not in the portal at all. I'm just, yeah, I hadn't gotten there yet. I was just, actually, I was just pulling up my banking information so I could get that ready. Okay. So what I can do, because we have a new, I'm going to resend this invoice. Okay. Now, this will do card. Do you need to do like ACH or something like that? I can do whichever one. I have a company debit card or an ACH if you prefer that. Card is probably easier. Okay. Now, let me see. Is this new system I found? So, now the one thing is it will enroll you in auto pay automatically. So, I'm going to turn off that requirement for your account. Okay, yeah. Since you're annual. Okay. Okay. So, let me make sure this invoice is updated. This way it goes to that. 3416 3416 58. Okay, so I'm going to resend this new invoice. Okay. And it goes to Sharon at Brightleaf. Okay, that's good. Okay. That's the new one with the adjustment. And you'll notice I also added where it says 5%. so that way okay we'll know what that is yeah yeah most of our five percent but okay I just like to see it okay let me see this is you okay I've got the invoice let me pull it up 34 yeah 36 times 49 299 that's 31 minus 179 okay can I give you the card number so when you get that invoice if you just go to view and pay in that invoice oh I can do that okay I can do it from there I've got it I'm going to do that right now and then also there's I think there should be a link in there that you ever want to go in the customer i mean you're not doing monthlies but what's really nice about the new system is you like when you want a payback card you no longer need to give it to us we're just sending you an invoice there's a view and pay option you can roll an auto pay yeah we're finally with the times now so oh okay well this is good i remember i remember when it was all done by hand it seems like oh yeah yeah and then like like well we could really outgrew what we were using before and and actually it's uh because before like like the thing we were using they didn't really have like auto pay so that was like a sales receipt which i was trying to complete this oven it's like walking up and i just like caught my coffee i'm like it's like walking up to your starbucks counter and then immediately handing you a receipt and while you may give a give a card it doesn't necessarily process it So we actually found a lot of major problems with that. So yeah. So it's a lot of maintenance and a lot of room for error where cards were not actually being processed, even though they're getting receipts saying that they did. So yeah. So we have changed. It was a big problem we just learned. So when you look at it, it looks like paid, so you didn't even notice. and yeah so big reason why we switched okay last a lot of money yeah oh my gosh yeah yeah all right well thank you very much I will take care of this right now I'm gonna I have it right in front of me to view and pay so I'll be doing that in a moment all right all righty and you Have a great day. You too. And happy holidays. Oh, yes. Long weekend. You're right. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.",
