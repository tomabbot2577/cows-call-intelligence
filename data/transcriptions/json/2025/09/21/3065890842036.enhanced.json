    "text": " Good afternoon. This is Kay. May I help you? Hi, it's Robin Montoni. How are you? I'm doing fine. How about you, young lady? Oh, pretty good. Not so young, but pretty good. Oh, look, everybody's young. Everybody's young. Oh, I don't know. I don't feel it so much anymore. Tom, once you hit 50, it goes downhill. right? Yes. And I'm well above 50. I'm halfway to the next grouping there. Yeah. Well, I will live in Blairsville, Georgia. Well, you at least got some sunshine. Like here in Cleveland. That's got to help some. Yeah. It's 71 degrees. Yeah, that's about up here, too. That's pretty nice out. And where do you live? We're in the Cleveland, Ohio area. Oh, you're way up north. Yeah, we're way up north. So I'm enjoying the sunshine while I can, or trying to at least. Yep. Yesterday, since we're sort of new to Blairsville, I have found that my neighbors are out mowing. I need to be out mowing too because they know more about the weather than I do alright what did we have we had failed transactions for you right yeah that's what it was do I go to that website that billing account thing yeah we could do that or I could do it for you it's up to you what's nice about if you do sign up for the billing portal if you ever wanted to go in and change your card or view your invoices or print receipts, you can always do that. But if you want for today, I can just get you set up. Okay, yeah, let me go ahead. Well, we're going to do auto pay anyway. And most of the time, y'all do receipts. And, you know, I always, on my bank statements, I always have that as a copy. So I assume that's good enough for the CPA. He hasn't ever questioned it before. The card we had in file ended in 0154. Is that not the correct card? That is 0154. No, that is the correct card. Okay. 0154. Yes, that is the correct card. All right. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to turn off the auto pay for a moment. Let's just redo this because wasn't it yours? I was saying it was something with an address. Let me see. Declined. Transaction details. Address information not verified for domestic transactions. I don't know what that means. It's not Blairsville, Georgia anymore, right? No, it is Blairsville, Georgia. 30512? Correct. Straight at. Okay. That's the zip code. The address is 2817 Georgia, you know, GA Highway 180. Oh, it says 2801. I wonder if that's how you do it. No, it's 2817. Okay. Let's try this. I want to kind of see what it does. Let's see. let's go med staffing I'm going to take this card out and then we'll just kind of redo it let me turn this off okay advanced options okay because stored payment methods I'm going to take this card out and I'm just going to kind of redo it and let's see what happens okay It's a stored payment method. Okay. So the name on the card, is it Kay Crosby? No, the one that you have. I tell you what, I did not do that. Let me go and get my wallet and confirm, because Crosby and I have, I think, the same account, but different numbers. Hold on. Oh, interesting. What? I'm actually going to fix your address in another place. Tell me your address again. I wonder if that has something to do with it. What is your address? 828-17, Georgia. They used to have it as capital G, capital A, Highway 180. Okay. Okay. And then what is the city and state? Blairsville, Georgia. And is it B-L-A-I-R followed by an S? Yes. Blairsville, B-L-A-I-R-S-V-I-L-L-E. Okay. And the zip code is 30512. Okay. Let me fix this in the back end first. I wonder if that has anything to do with it. Okay. I'm also going to update your next invoice to have the correct address. I'm going to have to change. All right. No. That is my card number. 0154 is my card number. Okay. Well, I took that one out. I want to do this all from scratch. So 2817 GA Highway 180, Blairsville, Georgia, 30512. Okay. All right. Because I'm wondering, because the system itself had a different address for your address, and I'm wondering if it was kind of maybe thinking it was suspicious being in a different state. I don't really know, but we're going to find out here if this helps. Okay. Okay. Okay, let me, hopefully that's synced over. Okay, so now I'm going to go to stored payment method and stored card. Okay, yeah, now it's doing the right one. Okay. All right, so the name on the card is Kay Crosby. Kay Crosby. Okay, what is the card number? 525. 5 3 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 1 5 4 So it's 5 2 2 5 5 3 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 1 5 4. Correct. Okay, and the expiration? Is 7 29 Okay. And the security code? 14-4. Okay. And then same thing, 2817 GA Highway 180, Blairsville, Georgia, 30512. Okay. Let me put that there. I wonder because we had that wrong. Probably an old address at some point. Med staffing. Okay. Do you want me to, can I try processing that one open invoice now and see if it goes through? Yes. Okay. Let's see. I'm going to take a moment to think up. I'm going to tell you if it doesn't go through because I'm paying out of it out of another business account Alpha Omega because we pay for this not Med Staffy okay it takes a moment to sync so I can't really tell yet okay All right. I don't see any alerts from my bank. A lot of times, sometimes they'll alert me to something, but I don't see anything. Yes, I believe it. Like, sometimes it's got to get, like, queued up for the transaction, and sometimes that takes a moment. Sometimes it's quicker than others, it seems. What I'm going to do in the meantime is... Now I also have a database of just our clients, which still has the Preston Road address. Should I also update that one? Yes. Okay. To the same Georgia Highway address. Okay. Well, no, actually the main office is in the Colony, Texas. We're just a branch. Okay. All right. So we'll just leave that as is. At least we got the billing right. Okay. I believe it went through I'm seeing a zero yep it went through oh yay so it should have sent you did you get an emailed receipt it should have done that automatically for you well not yet okay I went into my other Outlook account yeah I have it it should be going to yes you got it? okay just came in yeah because it also just processed okay you are all set okay yes okay no problem alright we have Thank you, Ms. Robin, for helping me figure this out. And it wouldn't let me log in anywhere. So we got it going. Now, if you want to do the sign-in, let's get you going on that. So that way you can at least see things. I just want to make sure we got that processed for you. So do you have that sign-in page to create the account? Okay. I had to change, let me go and do that again. Actually, Crosby had forwarded that one to me, so I've got it. I'm going to open it now. Okay. Yeah, so there's that create an account. So now that we have your email address as the primary email, what you'll do is click sign up. Actually, my email address was the main email address on there. Okay. Didn't I switch it to you today, earlier today? Uh-huh. Okay. So when you put in, so you'll have to sign up and create a password if you haven't done that yet. Okay. I'm at the point it says verify, it says verify are you human. It's because it already puts in a password. Okay. So I'm going to go verify, and I'm going to go sign up. And it said success. Okay. So once you get, yeah, once you go into the site, there's like four areas. Invoices are at the left. The vault at the right is where you could see your stored card. So we have it set up correctly now. It basically took care of that vault section for you. Okay. Wait a minute, because it says. click here to log in and it's it's you see what it says confirm your email okay confirm my email so see it sent me a confirm in okay I'm in okay so you could always go in here like if you needed to print like some invoices over the left you'll see invoices you may not see anything by default over there now because they're all paid but there's like a drop down to flip the views from open to paid or all okay i'm going to save this in my somewhere my phone uh computer so i have to do that. Okay. But it should automatically email you as you know when the invoice processes and things like that. You should automatically get receipts emailed to you. You should be all set up now. All right. Thank you. I do appreciate it. I'm going to say it in my favor. You are welcome. And if you need anything else just let us know. oh I will thank you you're welcome have a good week alright you too young lady alrighty bye",
