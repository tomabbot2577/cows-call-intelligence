    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Deb Oaks from Royal Bridge. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Are you aware of any issues that are happening between LinkedIn and your capture tool this morning? We had like a URL that was yesterday morning, but that was fixed. What are you experiencing today? Well, all of a sudden, everyone in my office, their capture tool got toggled to capture default company. And then Pete brought a couple people in this morning, or actually yesterday afternoon, he brought some people in. and their LinkedIn profile is in their attachments, but the LinkedIn URL is not on their page. Is that what happened yesterday? Yeah, what it was for some reason, I don't know what they did, but instead of saying it's social underscore LinkedIn, which is where we always stored it, it was like social underscore LinkedIn recruiter. It's an easy fix. I can fix that. But I don't know why it would automatically have captured a default company turned on because I'm looking at mine. I don't know. I know there was an update that went through yesterday and all of a sudden, you know, Pete sent me a message this morning. He goes, I don't know why, but I just realized that the last five people I've put into Mesero are all in candidates. And I don't know why that happened. I never toggled it back. And I went into my LinkedIn today and saw, Yes, it's showing that it was, you know, and when I switch databases, it does the same thing. I have to do it for every database. I have to move that slider. I don't know what would cause that because I'm looking at mine, and it's only connected to one database. You would have to log out, log in. But mine is still, like, set where it would go to the company. let me I'm going to log out and try going to Boise and see what comes up because that's the only one that I haven't accessed today I've already fixed it on the main and the Warbridge one let's see what it does that one's fine It's just so weird. Yeah, I haven't heard of that one. I don't know. I mean, that one is okay. It's just, but yeah, I'm both on me. The one yesterday was a URL. They both were slid over, and I've never had it set up that way. Yeah, that's kind of weird. I haven't noticed that, and I haven't heard of anybody where that was happening to. What database were you importing to yesterday or using capture for yesterday? She was putting it in the main database. Main, okay let me see. Yeah and it was it was P ransom that did it. Okay let me see how many records have that different URL. Let's see different field names. And there's probably only three of them, unless he puts them in other positions that I'm not aware of. Okay, let me just do that. But there's three that I haven't gone and fixed yet. And after a second, I'm like going, okay, why is the LinkedIn address not there? Because I figured I could just go to it, click on their LinkedIn URL and update their company. And it's not there. I'm like, that's weird. But yet when I go into attachments, it shows that he was brought in from LinkedIn. You know, I mean, there are pictures there from LinkedIn. you know and so I have to go into their attachments and open their profile in order to get to their LinkedIn profile okay let's see there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay answered some for other okay well this is just 10 in the database could be anybody and the other days I'm just looking at who has now here's the thing where they update or just do these one by one I think it's safer to do that I mean I've been going around doubling up so let me see yeah because what I've been doing is I've been going and then I've been just going and doing a click to update from their LinkedIn profile and then it puts it in it I think of it I didn't even notice if they added that and I did why Frank's waiting or this one the other one that I did at Slavia noon she's another one that I did but it actually she came in and then I did Gregory Brodeur. Okay. Those three this morning. Show off field. Okay, I'm going to move this to the regular one. Okay. Pam West is fixed. Next one here I'll tell you where you can kind of see not that you really care Dallas Faye is that the first name I guess so Dallas Faye Geraldo that could be because we have somebody in our company his name is Dallas Downey so and he's no relation to Jack either okay oh it's switched okay on their profile they must have it switched okay if you go to the name first name is gerald and last name is dallas a d-a-l-i-s-a-y D-A-L-I-S-A-Y. D-A-L-I-S-A-Y. Oh, I. He's in Houston, Texas. Okay. Yeah, John Fisher brought him in. Okay. So if you are on his name record, on the same toolbar we have like resume, activities, there's that three-lined icon. Click on that and select details, which is kind of like where all the custom fields are. If you scroll down under details, under the social networking field, switch it to where it says show all fields. and what I'm doing, that LinkedIn recruiter field should not have been populated. That's what was going on yesterday. It should be in LinkedIn. So I'm just doing a cut and paste, and I'm moving it over to social underscore LinkedIn. Yeah, so that's what I'm doing right now for that record. I don't see social underscore LinkedIn. I see LinkedIn. Because you're already in the social section, which is why it kind of cuts out that. So it wasn't supposed to be in the LinkedIn recruiter field. It was supposed to be in LinkedIn. Like we never used LinkedIn recruiter. So I don't know where they got that. So I just fixed that one. So there's eight more that I'm going to look at. I will fix this for you. But that's what I'm doing. Just so you know, I'm just going to swap it from one field to the other. And then that way it's supposed to be. Okay. Okay. So give me about five minutes tops and then I'll have this done. Okay. All right. Sounds good. And then I'll go fix those other three that I have. So, I mean, I can take care of Matt Baum. Because I actually have his record up, so I'll go ahead and I'll fix him. Oh, yeah, he's the last one on my search results that I have. Okay. Yeah, it's really just kind of swapping it one place to the other. Put that here. There it is. And I think I'll fix this couple. All right. That sounds good. I will wait a few more minutes and go in and work on the rest. Okay. Yeah, I'll take care of these swap outs. And as far as getting the URL URLs corrected, again, just a couple more minutes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And again, just a couple more minutes and I'll have it done for you. Okay. Okay, yeah. And then there's another thing that I've been noticing when I do do an import from LinkedIn. If they have a hyphen, but you know how when you're typing in Word, if you go and you type something, you put in a hyphen and then you type something else and as soon as you hit space, it makes that hyphen wider? Okay, yeah. For some reason, when I am pulling a report and I actually export it as a .XLX, well, as a CSV, and open it up in the CSV in Word or in Excel, it puts crazy phonetic characters in there. Oh, I think that's what I would do. take yeah so if i just take that long if i go into the record and i just highlight that and change it just to a regular hyphen then it's fine in the reports but then i also have i'm getting phonetic characters like if they have the registered trademark or the copyright you know the little r the little c or something like that after i'm getting phonetic characters in the csv as well yeah i believe that's because it's a part it's really just code specific it's like a Microsoft code, which isn't like, I believe is the reason for that. Okay. And they're kind of only recognized by like Word and stuff like that. Okay, yeah, because like I said, it's that, you know, it's any of them that have like the little circle around it that I've been having that issue with it changing it to some phonetic code type thing. And I'm like, Oh, that's just really weird. And so put in the register trademark. I mean I can go and type you know the the parent r parent and then changes it to the r from what it was there but it's like that's just really weird. So I just go in people's records and delete it when I see it but yeah it's just I didn't know if you knew that that was happening so. Um I haven't yeah it's it's kind of not much we can really do that because because it's really just a Microsoft code. So it's kind of like getting transposed, I guess, is the way to say it. I also would have problems when I would, let's say if I was sending code scripts to somebody where it was single quotes, if I was sending it directly through Outlook, Outlook was changing those symbols to be in their kind of code, and then the code wouldn't work. So I'd always send it a notepad, which is kind of more of like a plain text where it wouldn't do that. Microsoft just likes to format stuff their own way, which is why I'll be like you. Microsoft is on my bad list right now because I have been having nothing but issues this week with programs. And, you know, I'll go and I'll save my document. And then I went and I emailed it out to them and it reverted back to a CSV. I went, I literally changed when I went to save it, literally changed the dropdown where it said Excel workbook, you know, and, you know, from the comma separated to Excel workbook and hit save. And I saved it. And then when I went to send it, I send it right from Excel to my team. It went back to the original CSV and everything that I did was gone. It's like when it saved it, it didn't say, it didn't register that I changed it from a CSV to an X to an XLX. And it deleted it. And I had to go and redo the report. And then I'll go and I'll attach like six attachments in Outlook. And when I hit send, it will drop off one of my attachments. And it's like last night I emailed something out corporate-wide, and it had six attachments. And I had somebody email me back, hey, where's this file? And I'm like, it was there. I saw two plus four. Sometimes you have to be careful. When I went and looked at my sent folder, there were only five there. I'm like, where did it go? And I actually had a screenshot of it this time because I'm like, before I took it, I took a screenshot showing that all six were there. And I sent it. And then somebody emailed me back. I'm like, it was there. And I sent them a screenshot that it was there. I don't know why Microsoft deleted it. So now I'm going through and I'm only adding one document at a time. I can't just go to my folder and select six things and attach them all and then send it because it seems to drop one when I do that. I wonder if it's due to file size. Like maybe they're capping you out. I don't know. They're all PDFs. They're not very big. Oh, PDFs can be big, though. I've seen PDFs. But these, I've sent these. These are the same reports that I have sent out for years. Same size. Every single report is the same size. And now all of a sudden I'm having issues. Yet when I go, you know, it's only when I do like multiple attachments. If I go and attach everything one at a time and send an email, it goes out fine. Thank you, Microsoft, for making my job more. I wonder if they're just limiting the size. Who knows? They're getting stricter and stricter. I know. But when I go and I attach them one at a time, it sends the email back. It's only when I bring in multiples. it's so weird don't know on that one I've been emailing mostly through my Gmail account anymore I don't even like go to Outlook or well our email is hosted by Gmail but I don't even do it through Outlook anymore I just keep using my Gmail yeah I'm ready to just say you know we need to start thinking about maybe switching the whole company off of these Outlook, you know, off of Microsoft programs and go into Google. And I know two of my employees are going to have a bitty heyday if I do that. But, you know, but they're the ones that are always emailing, this isn't working, this isn't working. They're all like that anymore. I don't know if one's better than the other, really. I mean, they're just different. Like Google's just kind of like more like, you know, app-based, like in your account, like where it's not like an app you actually install. Oh, I know. And then Dropbox, you know, we try to do file sharing. We do it through Dropbox because trying to do it through Google Drive, if they don't have, if they're not a Drive member, it's hard to get them to share, even though you set it up to share everything that still makes them create a Gmail account. I'm like, that's so stupid. Oh, really? Oh, what I do with mine when I share things, I usually change it to anyone with the link. Yeah. And that's what I did. Oh, really? And the people would click on the link and it would go through and it would say, it would ask for your Google account. Oh. I'm like, that is weird. Yeah. I give up. Got a lot of technology, right? Yeah. And then when they're saying, this isn't working, I'm like, okay, send me a screenshot. I don't know how to do that. And I send them stuff. I said, I don't have time for this. then it's not going to get fixed. I finally emailed this one person. I go, well, fine. If you're not willing to take the time, then it must not be that big of an issue to you. Have a good day. I wish I could say that sometimes. I got a call back from my boss. I would be fired if I did it. What time you weren't fixing? I go, hold on, Jack. Let me forward you. Because he went and complained to Jackie. He's like, because we're not fixing this. I emailed him the email thread. Jack's like, okay, I will handle this. I told him, I said, this isn't the first time. I said, this is how he emails me every single time. No subject. Just says, fix this. And when I asked him to take five minutes of his time so that we can do either a screen share so I can just go and click, click, click and be done. He just doesn't have the time. And I told Jack, I said, it's getting very annoying. I said, and Danielle is having just as many problems with him even when she's in the office. I said, he doesn't even want to let her touch his computer. Because he's like, I got to be on the phone. Well, then we can't fix it if you don't. You know, get up and go to the bathroom while I'm doing this or something. You know, go get a cup of coffee. I'll have it done by the time you get back. And Jack's like, fine, I will go and I will have a talk to him. If you ever retire, please do not turn the company over to him because I will leave. I told Matt, I said, I will leave. I said, the day you turn it over to him is the day you will have my resignation. He's like, okay. Turn it over to you. I know. I'm like, I'm just, I'm done. I'm like, I don't have to take that kind of treatment from anybody. And I am not one to be bullied. And I went through this with my former supervisor and he ended up letting that supervisor go because he was not happy with her that she was doing that. And, you know, and I'm like, I have so many things going on my desk. It's just easier for me to just be me. And I know we work remote now and I'm not at the office. But, you know, hey, I'll be in the office next week. I can come and fix it. Nope, don't take that long. Nothing I can do. Anyway. Paul Carmen. All right. Well, hold on one second. I'm almost done. I think I missed one. I think I copied it. I just didn't remove it out of the original. Paul Carmen. and details. Yeah, I copied that. I just didn't clear out the original. Okay. So that gets rid of that field, existing. Okay. So the existing data, or the ones that this happened to, again, they're all fixed. Okay. So you've got nothing. Thank you very much. Things in Recruiter. I don't know how that happened, but fixed. alrighty well have a good weekend thank you you as well and I will talk to you later alrighty sounds good thanks okay yep bye bye",
