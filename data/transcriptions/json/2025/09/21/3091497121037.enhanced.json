    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, it's Rich. So I did what you asked. So what was interesting, I've been away for a few days. This morning, LinkedIn was working. And then this afternoon, it's not. But it's not anymore. Oh, okay. That is so strange. so yeah it was the click to add button that that appears and then this morning but now it's not appearing anymore i had like the update button this morning and you know i'll send it to you guys i don't know if when you went in did you do something because it was working before no yeah we didn't really do anything we just uh logged in under your your username and the button appeared for us as your login. So I am up to date. You know, I did what you told me. You know, I did do all the updates. I actually did it last night. And like I said this morning, you know, it worked, and now it's not working. Okay. So is there something like to uninstall and install? I mean, what do you recommend? So if you were doing something last night, did you happen to shut down your computer overnight? No. Okay. It was shut down, you know, but then last night I put it back on. And it did all the updates. It restarted but didn't shut down. Gotcha. Like you had specifically said shut it down, which I did, you know, now. And it's not. like I have this guy Vishal Kumar up and before I had the update option now I don't if you have that pulled up right now can you click the refresh button to the left of your web address just to check I did that okay I'm not sure yeah we're I was conversing with the team were kind of throwing around ideas and we thought maybe it was, since it's something to do with just your computer, that the Windows updates might be an option. But so that's all up to date now. But it also happened on my laptop. That's what's weird. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Because I was, remember, I was in LA and I was using my laptop. Gotcha. Okay. And it's the same nonsense. That is strange. And if you use your laptop, do you have your laptop with you today? I wonder if it's happening on both currently. You can put it on right now. All right, cool. Yes, if it was working for you on your computer this morning on LinkedIn or last night, then maybe something's working on your laptop in a similar way. Putting it on right now. Bear with me. All right. All right. Just firing it up. In my home office, I have this HP all-in-one, and now I'm firing up my laptop. Okay. There it was. Because I'm just wondering if I need to uninstall PC Recruiter or LinkedIn or both. Yeah, so I remember I made a note here at our troubleshooting steps that we have uninstalled the PCR capture tool and reinstalled it before, and that didn't help. No, I mean all of PC Recruiter. Well, PCR is just cloud-based where you access it through a web address, so there's nothing really to uninstall or reinstall. Same with LinkedIn. There's nothing to install or reinstall there. I'm on my laptop and I got the same problem. Hmm. Okay. Is this something like allow messaging or something? Meaning like a setting inside of your browser? Chrome. Yeah, like in Chrome, like where it's not allowing messaging or something like that? Not that I know of. Let me go to my Chrome settings and see if I can find. Yeah, there's nothing really to do with messaging too much on the Chrome settings. but either way, yeah, you said we tried it on Microsoft Edge, which is a different browser, so it would be strange that it wouldn't work on both. Would deleting browsing history help? I'm not sure. It's worth a try, but I don't think it would affect it too much just because both browsers are having the issue. Yeah, I'm just looking over our list of our things we've tried with troubleshooting. Yeah, let's hit on everything. it's very strange that it was working for you this morning as well so I don't know I don't know what would cause it to switch off again let's try this if you go to the search bar at the bottom of your screen by the Windows logo So type in settings. We're just looking for the overall Windows settings, system settings. Okay, I'm there. Okay, and if you open those up and you go to system on the left, it's one of the categories of settings. Do you see anything on the right there related to do not disturb? or it might be in a category called notifications. Focus? Yeah, check focus. Yeah, I do. Notifications, alerts from apps, do not disturb. Is that turned on or off? Get notifications from apps and senders that's on. Do not disturb is off. Oh, okay. Do not disturb is off. That's the one I was looking for. if do not disturb turns on, maybe that would block extensions from doing their pop-ups. Is there a setting that says turn on do not disturb automatically right below that? Yes. If you click on that, try deselecting anything that's selected in that range. So you should have no checkboxes selected under turn on. So notifications, get notifications should be turned on. Right. And do not disturb should be off. Right. And then when you expand turn on do not disturb automatically right below that, there's some things that you can check or uncheck. I unchecked them all. Okay. That's good. And what about focus session? Should I click on that focus? Yeah, click on that. Let's see if there's anything. I'm following along on my computer, too. So it says start focus session. Okay. Yeah, this would be if we just wanted to turn on focus, which would be similar to turning on do not disturb, so we wouldn't want to do that. OK. How do I know that it's not on? It's blue. You know, it's a start focus. There's an arrow. It would it would only turn on, I guess, if you were to click on start focus session. Oh, God. So, yes, I don't think that one would affect anything. All right. So I guess after looking at some of those settings, maybe go back to LinkedIn and hit refresh on the page and see if that helped at all. In message settings, you know, when I'm on the bottom of my screen, I have my name, you know, for messaging on LinkedIn. Oh, okay. Message settings. always open new messages is on play sound from you know focused inbox focused inbox settings update settings I'm not sure with that let me jump over to LinkedIn that might just be you want to see my screen okay good Yeah, I just logged in right now. Manage conversations, messaging settings, always open new messages, play sounds, use the focused inbox settings, activate status, active status settings. I don't think there's – no, yeah, those are all just related to that little messaging box. I don't think those would have an effect on the outside extension. So I think you're good on all the settings you have there currently. Okay. I'm not sure what it is. Do you remember, like, the timeframe that it was working this morning? I wonder if it's like after a certain time, something turns on or turns off on your computer. I'm trying to think. It had to be like 10, 10, 30, 11. It was working. OK, OK. All right. Yeah, I guess our next test then. So I'm going to go back to my team and let them know that their suggestions about the Windows update didn't work. But in the meantime, tomorrow when you log in, check around that same time, 10 o'clock, that area. And if it's working again, then it leaves me to believe that there might be a setting that's being flipped on or either flipped off, something like that, at a certain time of the day. And that might help narrow it down. But if it doesn't work around 10 a.m. tomorrow, then that theory is out the window. But, yeah, I'll go back to my team and see what else they can come up with for different troubleshooting options. Yeah, I mean, obviously I want to use the LinkedIn because I can't bring in, you know, the profile. Right, right. Yeah, it's definitely an important part of the process, that tool. All right. Well, thanks. I will let you know tomorrow morning if it works. Okay, good plan. Yeah, and I'll get back to you as soon as I hear any next steps. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Thanks. Bye. Thank you.",
