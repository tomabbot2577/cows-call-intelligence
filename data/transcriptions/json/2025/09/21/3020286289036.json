    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. How you doing? It's Joe Brown from Genesis Long Time. Hi. How are you? I'm doing pretty good. Doing pretty good. Hey, I wanted to give you a call. I connected with Jim. I can't think of his last name. He took over for Jim Wise. Oh, yes. Lombardo? Jim Lombardo. Yeah, he's been here forever. Yeah, Lombardo, there you go. So I'm going to be closing out things with PC Recruiter. It's been a while, like over 10 years now, but I've got another APS system. So I asked him for a couple things. one, I think I figured out how to get most of my data out of PCR through a CSV file. I think I'm good on that side. The thing that he mentioned to me was something I was surprised about. He's like, oh, yeah, you still have a little term left on your agreement. I'm like, what term? He's like, oh, yeah. your contract that you signed yeah yeah there's like you know it renews like every year well robin i didn't know that i didn't know that you guys were renewing me a year agreement every year i thought after the first year that i was clear you know like in many times every agreement has an automatic renewal term that's in the agreement is that right wow well can you guys you know under the circumstances can you guys waive that i don't want to be i highly doubt that because i mean Otherwise, any customer just calls up and, you know, you can't highly doubt that. So what I'd have to do, that would have to be, that's certainly nothing that I could ever approve. Sure, sure. And, yeah, so basically we do go by the agreement. Got it, got it. Yeah, well, you know, if you could reach out to Bill or whoever. I mean, you know, I'm a little – and I'm very happy with PC Recruiter. You guys have been great over the years. It's been, you know, a great relationship. But this irritates me because I didn't – I mean, you know, I don't think that me automatically signing, you know, something, which I – you know, I signed up with you guys. And most of the agreements, like right now I have LOXO, right? The first year, yeah, unless you change something or modify something, you know, upgrade, downgrade or something, then you get a new agreement. But it's been the same, you know, every year, right? Right. Which is also why your rates don't go up either. Yeah, no, no. I mean, I appreciate that. I appreciate the rate not going up. But, I mean, I think under, you know, being with you guys 10, 11 years, whatever it's been, and then to try to hold me in for when I'm like, hey, I had no idea. I think that that's kind of, that's not good. So if you could, you know, whoever is the powers that be, have them call me back and we can talk about it because I definitely, you know, I'm trying to go ahead and exit out. The other thing that he had mentioned was, oh, yeah, you know, in order to get your data, you know, we've got to charge you like a couple hundred dollars. I'm like, it's my data. Why would you charge me money to get my own data, you know? Yeah, so these would be questions that, like, Jim would have to address. But, yeah, because otherwise we do charge for the data return. And you might actually have a different rate in your agreement. We did up it recently, but if you have an older agreement, your rate for that data turn might be a little bit lower. And the reason is we have to have somebody going in and literally generating all that, backing it up, sending it to you, things like that. So it is a process to do it that we spend time to do. And if we don't have a charge on it, someone's going to come, oh, give me another one, give me another one. So, yeah, we do charge for that service. that service. Well, I mean, yeah, but again, I think that there's got to be, you know, I'm irritated about it because I feel like. It's all in the agreement. Yeah, I understand agreement, Robin, but under the circumstances with someone that's been with you guys as long as I have, don't nickel and dime me with stuff like that. It just makes a good situation turn bad, you know, and that's how I feel now. It's like, I'm like, come on, you guys. I mean, you know, I've been with you guys so long, and now when I'm trying to say, hey, look, I got to move on, now there's all this, you know, it just feels bad. So whoever kind of manages the agreements or the billing, the thing that I already got the data, I did the CSV file, did it on my own, so no worries about that. the thing that is concerning is that there's he said like a couple more months are on my agreement like no you know we would continue invoicing there is like a formal cancellation process that Jim would have to initiate yeah well do me a favor and have whoever I don't know I can't remember Bill's wife's name or whoever is in charge have them call me back about it and tell them i'm really not happy about it i think it's unfair and it's something that should be said not kind of at this auto renewal thing i have no idea that you guys are putting me on a year agreement every year i had no idea okay and i can afford okay i do have a training starting in three minutes i can after that training send them over an email I'm so sorry and then what I can also do is find the agreement as well and send that over to you I don't need to look at the agreement I don't need to look at the agreement I just need to talk to someone that can override because they can understand that what happened but then we would have no just have someone call me back Robin okay thanks bye",
