    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Ryan at KBASEN. Looks like it's just going to be me and you for the remainder of time, huh? Hey, so I've got an office. It's SRA underscore the SWAN group. I am trying to make the IMAP connection to office, but the only option I'm given is a pop three, and I don't know what I'm missing. Oh, okay. It might be that they haven't paid for IMAP to be part of their package. I will check on that. I didn't know that was a thing. We don't have many customers. Oh, I see. Okay. Let's see. Yes, IMAP is part of the SWAN group. Let me check on something here. I was going to say, I think the majority of our SRA customers should have iMovie. Right. It's very few. I would imagine I don't have that. All right. Let me add that in. It's part of their package. I just looked over everything, and I don't know why it's missing. That's pretty strange. No worries. All right. That's been added in, so if you just want to kind of refresh whatever page you're on in PCR mail, you should see it available. Yep, that's it. Perfect. Okay, awesome. Okay, I appreciate it very much. Thanks, Garrett. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. All right, will do. Have a good one.",
