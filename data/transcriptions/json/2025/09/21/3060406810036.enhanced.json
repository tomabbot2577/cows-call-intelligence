    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Hey, Garrett, this is Cindy with Bulldog Recruiters. I have a question for you. I've got no Internet right now. I'm having issues with Internet, but I do have Internet availability for my iPad. I'm trying to get to PCR on my iPad, but it's asking me to change login or URL or code. It's saying my account is not found at this time because it keeps asking me for my email address of what to log in. I don't know how to use the – is there an app or is there a different way? If you are a contractor, please see your activation email to access the app. So maybe I'm not doing something right. I don't know. So your username usually is not an email address if you are entering that in. So let me. You're not asking me that. Yeah. So I can access stuff through Gmail on my iPad. That's about it. So do I have to download an app? I should have. No, you should be able to use. Okay. You should be able to use the browser. I'm just going to send you. You said you can access your email? Yeah, I can. I can. Okay. I'll send you an email with your, let's see, with your correct web address, just to make sure you're trying to get to your login screen for PCR. Okay. Because I guess I went to the App Store and downloaded it, but so that's different? That's different, yeah. It's kind of a truncated version of PCR where you're only looking at records like a Rolodex. You can't really perform any of the actions that you could if you were logging in. I'll get rid of that then. Okay, thanks. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Okay. So I'm just going to send you this web address here. Yeah, we moved over the weekend. And actually, I probably need to change my address with you guys, too, because I think you have a really old address on my billing record, which I just, you know, my bills just go through automatically. So I don't pay attention to the bills or the invoices. But I think I need to get everything updated with you. So after you, if you could put me through to whoever I need to be on that, that would be great. But, okay, I'm in my email right now. Okay. Let me just grab your web address. I'm still getting that email together for you. One sec. I'll tell you, this is a pain in the neck. Even Verizon, I'm having issues with Verizon. They're sending me out. We moved, and I didn't realize that I moved into the burbs, I guess. But, you know, I'm in Orlando, and usually everywhere you go around here is fine. But not this location, I guess, is still pretty new. Oh, okay. Okay, PCR login. address and send. Okay, I sent you over the PCR login URL and your username, which is Cindy. And I don't know the password, so you'll have to enter that and choose your database. Yeah, I think I wrote... Let's see if I wrote that down from... I wrote that down from Google. Okay, so let me see. Yeah, I knew Cindy was my login, but it was from that other thing I couldn't get to it. Let me try this. Okay. Where's the login on here? It's not showing me the login. It's just system status, system normal. Okay, so the login isn't appearing on the right. No, no, no, no, no. I got it, but it's very tiny. So let me see if I can get in here. after today I realized I'm going to go get the keyboard that goes with this iPad. We'll make it much easier. Okay. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah. Oh God, you're a God. Thank you. At least I can get some work here done. Yeah. Thank you. Much appreciated. Okay. I'll probably reach out if you need anything else. Yeah. Let's go get my address all corrected. Oh yeah. Let me transfer you over to billing. if they aren't available it will go right to robin's voicemail who's head of billing so i'll transfer you over just leave a message if no one picks up over there i'll transfer you now and uh yeah definitely reach out if you need anything else okay thank you thanks",
