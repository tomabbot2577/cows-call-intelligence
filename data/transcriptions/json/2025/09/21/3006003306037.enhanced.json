    "text": " Hello? Hello, Ernest. Can you hear me this time? Yes, hi, how are you? I'm so sorry. My computer did this thing where my audio disconnected, and it, like, closed the log mode. I couldn't hear you. No worries. I'm so sorry about that. I can hear you now. You can hear me now. So, hi, you called. What can I do for you? My name is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Well, I have a recruiting company, but I haven't been able to do it in like a year because I take care of my family. I called like a year and a half ago and paused my membership. I'm getting all these bills. And I owe monthly. So I'm just curious. I'm getting like six, seven, eight, nine, ten of them emails a day. I'm like, what's going on? I see. Okay. All right. I could explain a little bit of maybe this started probably a couple of months ago, like maybe like April. Right. Okay. Yeah. So, sure. Sheesh. I think it was like either at the end of March, beginning of April-ish, we switched over to a new billing firm that will handle all of our internal invoices and things going forward. And so we took like all the information we had in our prior billing system and moved it over to the new billing system. And so there is kind of like this weird subcategory of people, I guess, that you fall into where like maybe you're on hold or something or. Can you tell me my balance? Can you tell me my balance? I mean, I look at my account. Can you tell me the last time I logged into it? I mean, I think it's been like two years. me personally um i cannot but i know you know i could get your info and like send it all along the line of to the billing department and she can resolve all this stuff like she can look at all that and see like you haven't logged in have been using it and um we know we kind of know like that there's been like this weird transition over to the new billing system and some people have called and like you just haven't checked your email i guess in a while and now you see like all these email so we understand we understand them just um i'm just gonna need to like get all your info basically so i know your your name is earnest uh last name s-c-a-l-v-i is that right okay yeah that's on the caller id um let me make sure that i just have you in our internal system here i'm pulling up earnest skull the in are you with there's two different companies that nine hospitality hospitality okay nine hospitality that's what the database is called yes okay i see oh it is turned off okay yeah i don't think i got like Okay. Well, yeah. Crazy. I got a... Yeah. Well, if you shouldn't be getting those, then we'll definitely resolve that, obviously. Yeah. Three years ago, it was an install ticket and no tickets. All right. Well, I'll send... Okay. So, I'll send a detailed message along to the billing. Basically, I'll just make a ticket in our help desk system with your name and saying, overdue emails from the new system, I think you might have to... Well, I don't know. The billing department will get back to you. Her name is Robin. She's handled many things like this recently. I'm sure it'll be all good. If you shouldn't be paying, you don't have to worry. It's just a new system where your name was brought over from the old system and the new system just has all these automated messages it sends out. And I guess like if you're not paying, which is correct, because you shouldn't be, maybe we just didn't have like you flagged as like a completely turned off or something in the previous system. So the new system thinks you should be paying, but we could we could fix it. She'll reach out to you via email. Can I make sure the email that we have for you is OK still? E.James. Yeah, the actual number nine hospitality.net. Perfect. OK, perfect. Yeah, so we'll reach out to you through the help desk system about this all. Send an email to Robin and make sure she understands. You're getting overdue bills, but you've been turned off and shouldn't be getting them. And she'll contact you about what to do or if there is anything for you to do or if there's any updates. She might just turn it off and let you know. But it's not that I don't want it. I just can't use it right now. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. What's the situation? Are you on hold? I got a lot of business stuff, personal stuff. I'm not able to work recruiting too much right now. But the long term, yeah. Okay. I just wonder if, let me look at, I have access to the tech stuff. Do you have another minute to stay on the call? I can check one thing. I can see if you're on hold. Because if you're on hold, that means all your data is still kind of there. we kind of like move it off to the side kind of like I was even asking you I deleted my data yeah that was even tough okay I'm okay well then I'm assuming you're on hold let me just verify um sorry I'm going to look this up in a second nine has fidelity on hold yep okay yep yeah you're in there you're good so okay it looks like you should be maybe you should be getting like i don't know like a 20 a month bill or something uh are those fine but i yeah no i got 180 130 140 it's like okay okay so you you would be expecting like a cheap like on hold type of invoice but you're getting kind of like a full price invoice okay yeah we'll fix that we'll fix that uh let me see I got to tell you right now. So I got an email at 1053 AM, 1053 AM, 1153, 1153, 1026. This invoice is 126. This invoice is 18233. This invoice is 10326. And so forth. I have no idea what all this is. Okay. Okay. Robin will reach out and clarify through the ticketing system. I'm about to just write up everything we talked about here in the call and a ticket and send it over to billing and ask her to clarify and we'll get you all squared away. Thank you. So, yeah, look out for that email. It'll go to the email that we talked about that we verified earlier. And, yeah, we'll go from there. All right. Anything else? Nope, that's it. All right. Cool. all right well then have a good rest of your day um thank you yeah no problem thank you bye",
