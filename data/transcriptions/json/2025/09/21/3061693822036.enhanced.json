    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Well, good morning, Tyler. This is Butch Sweetarm with Omega Point Partners. How are you? Good. How are you, Butch? Good. Got a quick question. My capture little icon isn't showing when I bring up a LinkedIn profile. And I know this has happened before. I just don't remember how to fix it. Yeah. So do you see the little puzzle piece in the top right-hand corner of your browser? Yes. Yeah. Go ahead and click that little puzzle piece and go to manage extensions. Okay. All right. Got extension showing. Do you have the, so do you see the PCR capture extension? Let's see. Got a bunch of them here. Yes, I do. Okay. And there should be a little toggle in that box for PCR capture. Is it on and to the right? And like it shows blue? Yes, blue with a cross line on it. yep all right go ahead and click go ahead and turn that extension off and turn it back on okay and then go back to the LinkedIn page okay and refresh the page all right Well, son of a gun. What causes that anyway? So sometimes it could be your browser cache that does it. I see. Other times it could just be how the page loaded. I got you. So page didn't load fully and completely the right way, causes the capture tool not to load. Well, tell you what. It's an easy fix, as always. So thank you so much for your help, and, hey, I hope you have a great weekend. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
