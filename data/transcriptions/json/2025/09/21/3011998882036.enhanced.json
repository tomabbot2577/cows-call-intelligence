    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hi, Benjamin? Hi, Jim. This is Jim with PC Recruiter. I was calling. I got an email to Josh. He's no longer with the company. But I wanted just to give a quick call, confirm that you're looking to cancel your PC Recruiter account. Yes. Okay. Do you need a data return? Pardon? It is $175 cost. and we would make it available in a downloadable format of the entire database. So you can take it with you. I guess the thing was it's really easy. So we probably have to do stuff in there, but it didn't really match our needs for a startup. So, like, it would make sense to do it in a more structured way. We just weren't really living in it. So there's not a whole lot in there. I think it's probably okay. Okay, so you don't need that. And the reason you're leaving, you just weren't using it? It wasn't a fit? Was there any major things we were lacking or any reason or just never adopted it? Well, I mean, I've traditionally used APSs for past agencies and just kind of assumed that we would need one. Now, at some point, I feel like it would be beneficial to have one from an infrastructure standpoint, staying organized when we have more of a significant recruiting team or things of that nature, but there's not really much of a sourcing capability to it. So we just have to have separate resources. living in you know 12 different other systems as it is you know different platforms for sourcing and bd and all that stuff so didn't really adopt it seemed like it had a lot of functionality but there's just so much front-end work required from like a sequencing standpoint and then we've had a lot of email deliverability problems so they would have to get routed through different things and and anyway, it just didn't end up being a fit for us. Okay, okay. Well, just to let you know, we do have a new product, which is more of a CRM. So if that's of interest, that is going to be a little bit different format. Maybe I'll reply to your email, send you the site on that so you can take a look. If you want to set up a demo and take a look at that, let me know. But what I'll do, I'll go ahead and get the cancellation ticket in, get the process underway to get that happening. Okay, great. And then when would that wrap up? Oh, let's see. Let's see when your contract is up. Do you know when your contract, when you signed? I want to say it was, you know, I guess summer, fall, last year. I want to say August. That's what it was. Yeah, it is August 8th. So your contract is up on August 8th, so I'll just make that the cancellation date. You're already, you fulfilled that. So that is all set. There's no early termination or anything because you're matching right up with your one-year contract date, so that's all good. But I'll go ahead and get things in with no data return right now. Yeah, and also there was a – I mean, I had gone and scaled back the users, but they still continued to charge me for a couple users. Like, is there another bill that's coming? I don't know. You're only one user now, and the only possible bill might be for one more month if you haven't paid in July already. But maybe you have, maybe you haven't. I don't know. I don't know if I have, but I guess I scaled it back down a couple months ago and then noticed they were still charging me for two at one point. I haven't gone to go do the accounting for it, but they had it on as myself in an admin role. So I think that might have been why they were charging me for two. but I mean I wasn't even logging into mine but um is that something you can look into as far as if I'm going to get charged again I'd like to get that back in some form okay well let me see that was overcharged okay uh best thing that I can do uh is check and see if there's something due in July and maybe not have that one canceled before it's charged. So kind of cancel that. I don't know. I have no authority to give any refunds. I don't work in accounting. But I'll ask around, see what my accounting team says and see what happened. It looks like as of June, they dropped you down to one. So that has been adjusted. That charged me when I noticed it. They had still been charging me for two. So I don't know when that was that I moved it down to one. and how long it was they were still charging me for two i don't know how long that period was um but i've definitely been overcharged so at a minimum i don't want to be charged anything else additional but um beyond that i'd like to know how much i was overcharged from that period so if you can find that out and then if you can ask accounting great if not forward me to them and I'd like to figure out what that recourse would be for being overcharged. Okay. Yeah. I, I, Joe, I'll, I'll check with them. Like I said, I don't think they generally refund for overcharges. I'm sure they don't want to, but you know, I, I, I get that, you know, but you guys overcharged me. So, I mean, at a minimum, I'm not paying anything else and I'll, If I have to, go talk to my credit card. But I would like to get that trued up to what I should have been accurately charged for services rendered. Okay. Yeah, I will loop accounting in, see what's going on with that, and check it from there. Thank you. All right. And you said your name is Jim? My name is Jim, yep. All right. Thank you, Jim. Appreciate it. Very well. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
