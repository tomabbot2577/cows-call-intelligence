    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Jim, how are you? I'm well, Scott. How are you? Hi. Is your camera up? Oh, you know what? No, I didn't even have it on the screen. I just dialed in. I don't even have the Zoom showing it on my screen. why don't we okay okay we'll do that i will pop that back on i think i'm getting in here now okay yeah perfect there there we go yeah i dialed in wasn't even looking at the screen i didn't have you up there or anything at all so i apologize all right yeah i'm just gonna don't mind me i'm gonna be eating my uh my lunch as we go through because you know how it works you get busier in You know, time is going to always go along. For sure. Uh-huh. What I've been doing sitting here all day, just working along. But, yeah, I think Brian was going to hop on as well. But I wanted to just kind of talk with you, see what we needed to do. I think there's a database we're converting, maybe another old PC router database we're re-spinning off or something. Well, I have an old PCR disk. I don't even remember what's on there. It's been a long time. Okay. And Brian did send me an external DVD-R drive that I need to still – Well, again, so I'm not really concerned about that one. The one I am concerned about is my database inside BigBiller. Okay. So I want to be able to take that and migrate it over. Yeah, so we can do that. So Brian talked about data conversions. He said they'll cover the cost. The BigBiller conversion, it takes, I want to say, like 60 days to get it done. we have four or five others going on right now and they run through they convert the whole database over good news is we know big bill pretty well and the guy who does our conversions very familiar with them likes them so they're they're a good one okay okay yeah that works and also i needed i need a refresher course on pcr okay yeah you've used in the past right a while back? Many years ago. Okay. And I heard not a lot. I mean, it's been updated, but I know the whole thing behind PCI was to keep it simple, not to over-indicate people with too much stuff that they're never going to use. Certainly, certainly. Did you want more of a product demo? Did you want more training? Or do you know? What were you thinking? I haven't even opened it up yet because I haven't done anything with it. So I think it's cloud-based, right? Yep. So I would say probably just a working, you know, just showing me what's there. And, you know, I mean, I pick up on these things pretty quickly, but I just want to make sure that I'm doing it the right way. For sure. For sure. Hello, Brian. With Big Biller, I can do mass email blasts and all that. I'm sure PCR has the same capabilities, I would imagine. Yep, for sure. Okay. Certainly, certainly. Okay. So what I want to do, because I know you remember Trey, who used to work for the company. Obviously, he's not there, but he used to work in higher ed, and that's my specialty. So I want to be able to get in there and see what he had going on, see what clients he worked with, When's the last time you worked with them? What kind of relationships? See what's salvageable, you know? Sure. Sure. See, so I could get you scheduled for just a plain product demo. Would you rather wait until you have your data in? What's your feeling on that? No, I like to do it sooner or not, and I want to start putting stuff over. So give me one second here. I'll go to him. Hey, Jim. Hey, Brian, how are you? Hi, Brian. Good. How are you guys doing? Pretty well. Good. How are you? Good, good, good. Give me one second, guys. I'm just replying to a meeting here. And then, Brian, we've got to make time to finish our... Yep. Did you ever plug in the DVD player so we could see the backup of that old database? I was just telling Jim, not yet, because I need to do that. I'm just getting things set up. So I'll, you know, the old PCR from, you know, 15 years ago, I'm not. We'll get that over. My biggest one to migrate is the Big Biller database. Yep. Yep. So that we can get started. Brian, I will send you the paperwork. We need an agreement signed. We can do payment paperwork, get all that done. And then get the data here. Who has the data, the backup of Big Biller? Big Biller, we don't have a backup yet. Right. Okay. okay so so we'll need to get a backup from them and upload it to you guys perfect so yeah we can do get paperwork going and that once that that's all ready you'll work with my keys he was the one who you work with to get the data and he'll go through everything like that and I told her that it'll take 60 days ish to get done good news is Mike is real familiar with the bill and he loves him so he likes that product he works very well with it he really converts them pretty well and we do it quite a bit so that's good yeah so that That will be action item one. I will email that to you and get that underway. Number two, so the PC Recruiter data, it's a disk, like an old backup. Were you thinking to get that to us, is it something you can Dropbox to us rather than send a physical disk or anything? Yeah, once Scott's able to plug in that DVD player that I sent him, we'll be able to look and see what's on there and see if it's a SQL backup or what it is. I have no idea what's there. So from that point, we'll be able to figure it out. And if it's SQL, I don't know what version it's going to be and how many versions it'll have to jump through to get up to a version that'll work with the current model. Perfect. So that we can worry about. That's kind of phase two once you have a chance to look at that, see what it is, see what we need to do, and then get it here. We can do that there. And then, Scott, did you want to get a time set up? Maybe Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week to get a demo? One second. I need my calendar. Scott, give me one second here. On PCR or PCRM, what were you wanting to demo? PCR for now because he said he hadn't seen it in so long, wanted to take a look at it. We could look at PCRM if he's going to. Do you have it on where he's going to be? He's got access to three of our different databases down here, one being the one he signed about with Trey Wright with higher education. So if he can log into any one of those and then, I guess, determine if we need to do a demo. And then if we do, when Holland over here, we'll probably go through everything with him. So we won't have to pressure do that. You know, just, just a refresher. It's been a long time. Yep. And we can do that. That's not a problem. How about Tuesday? The eighth. Well, we can do Scott. We'll do the refresher. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Okay. That'll work. Yeah. You all know it as well as we do over there. So that's going to certainly be good. Okay, so it looks like what I need to do, get the conversion paperwork your way, Brian, to get that underway because that's going to be priority number one. Let me know once you know about the data, the backup. We can get that going. Ed, is he going to be an additional user to an existing database anywhere? If so, just pop me an email when you add the new users or any new users you need to add. Yep. I've already added him. Is there an easier way to do that instead of having to tell you every time we add somebody, or is it when it runs the report at the end of the month, does that suffice? Or whenever you guys run that report? Yeah, I think we run the report. Usually Jessica Laura, is that who that is? I think works with KVIC. She gets the master account, and she has been really good about it. At the end of every month, she pops me a quick email and says, hey, send me a report to match this invoice. She and I look at it, and then usually if it's up, if it's down, I think this last month there was two or three added, and that might have been what you added. Yeah, and then she always asks me who these people are, who they belong to, which makes me scratch my head because she gets the emails that refer to these new hires. And it says what database they're going to be in. But I'm like, okay, Jessica, I'll tell you. Yeah, you've got to love that. Yeah, she's a sweetheart, so I can't tell her no. No. Like clockwork every month, she comes to me and says, I got the invoice. Please let me know logons. And I send them all. And then sometimes she asks me, well, who are these? I said, I don't know. I don't know where they are. You know. But, yeah, so that's all good. So nothing to worry about there. So we are all good. I'll get that your way, Brian. And then anything else you need, just let me know. Awesome. Anything else you can tell me? You said 60 days, but I think I said two to three months to Scott. So that's kind of on par. so not surprising I'll just continue paying for Big Miller until it's done do you have a and you can continue working in there too keep it going well yeah you know just kind of keep whatever I have going on and I'm trying to get myself so I am converting myself to the new system the new way I think so I'm trying to trying to get myself up to speed as soon as possible. Okay. And, yeah, keep using BigBiller. Part of the process is Mike will take the backup we get initially, map it, run it, he'll work with you, he'll show you what it looks like, take any changes, take suggestions, and everything is exactly as you want it. He'll go ahead and get a final backup. So that will collect anything that you used during that couple of months in BigBiller, stop using it at that point, send him the backup, and then he'll run it over a weekend is usually how that will go. Yeah, I just need help. because you can go there, you can ask for your download or your backup. I just need to make sure, you know, Brian, that you know, you can log into my computer or whatever and you know what to do with it and take it and we're good, right? Yeah, yeah, we can get it and we can Dropbox it or OneDrive it over to Mike and we can get you it. Perfect. That sounds good. I mean, that was really it. So I will connect the – I just haven't plugged it in. So I'm self-admitting. And I've been a little inundated with a lot of stuff that I was hit with the first week, which is fine. You know, welcome. Welcome back to corporate life. Drinking from a fire hose. Anything else? Got anything else on the PCR side you can think of? And then I'll connect with you on everything else. No, I just want a refresher. And we can do that with Wynn. And he can walk me through and let me know. And it won't take me long to catch, you know, it's like riding a bike, figure it out. and yeah, that's it. So it's pretty simple. Yep, yep. It won't be that big a deal. Cool. Well, Jim, I guess I'll see you in 19 minutes. Oh, are you on that too? Oh, yeah. I got an invite. So I was like, Jim wants to be there. I'm going to be there, darn it. Forgot who that was. But yeah, I'll talk to you in a little bit. All right. Thanks, Jim. Appreciate it. Thank you, Scott. Bye. Bye. Bye. Take care. Bye now.",
