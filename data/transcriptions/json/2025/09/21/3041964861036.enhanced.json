    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. Hi, Rob. Yeah. Hi, this is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Oh, hey, Robin. How are you doing? I'm good. Yeah, I added one of your, let's see, because I think one of them was bouncing or something. I added both emails. Yeah, the plan of people would bounce because I got rid of that a couple years ago. Okay. All right. Yes. So we switched billing systems. And like in the old place, like you might have a customer area, but then there is an area for who the invoice goes to. The new system is just kind of like one. So maybe that's where it is. Okay, so I'm just going to change this to the one email address. So the emails that you might have just got, because I think I did resend them, I probably sent them to both emails, so they're probably the same invoice number. Different invoice numbers, and that's what confused me. Yeah, two different emails, but two different invoice numbers, too. I was like, oh, that's what it is. Yeah, but you might have resend them to the other one. So there are two invoices. One's dated June 25th, and the other one's July 25th. Okay, that's fine, I guess. Okay. I mean, it doesn't matter. I don't really look at the invoices. I mean, basically, I just bank them, and I haven't gotten an invoice from you guys for a while. Yeah, so the reason is because we had the other email address, and then with this new system, we're catching things, too, like being able to do a little cleanup on stuff. Yeah. When we hit you with the old system, what probably happened is it was probably just auto pay and with a card, but we couldn't transfer like all the card details because a lot of it's like mass for security. You only see like the last four numbers. So with the new system, you would have to go into one of those invoices at least your first time and then put in your card information and then auto pay. Yeah, so because you used to be on what was called like a sales receipt, which is really like kind of just emails you a receipt and then tries to process a card. It was like a way to get around them not having auto pay, really. So it's kind of archaic way. So now it's just everybody gets an invoice and you just put in your card number, but you can sign up for auto pay. You just have to go into one of those and put in the card details. But you'll want to go in and pay both of those. And then going forward, it can just use auto pay again. Oh, so I didn't have a payment for June? So, yeah, there was a June. I think I saw one on the 5th. So, yeah, on June 5th, you paid your May invoice. Okay. So let me see. Is auto pay not turned on? Is that what's going on? Yeah, you don't have auto pay enabled. Oh. Okay. All right, so I just need to log in, put the card in, set it to auto-pay again? Yeah. Or do you want me, if you want, I could do it for you if you want. Yeah, that'd be fine. I mean, whatever. Okay. Okay, so let me go in here. You probably need my card number, right? Yeah. Yeah. Let me know when you're ready. Yeah. I'm just trying to hold it. Okay, so you need the name on it first? Yes. It's Robert A. Ebel, E-B-E-L. Okay, wait, what is Robert? And then it says... Sorry, sorry, Robert, what was the middle initial? A. A. A. And then E-B-E-L. Ebel, E-B, yeah, E-B-E-L. Okay. A. A. And then E-B-E-L. E-B-E-L. Bay Recruiters LLC. Okay. Bay Recruiters LLC. Okay. Card number? All right. And card number is 4019-2500-1831-4809. And the expiration month and year? Uh, 6 of 26. Okay. And the security code? Uh, harder to read. Hang on. Uh, 355. Okay. Is it still 20048 Bluff Oak Boulevard, Tampa, Florida, 33647? Uh, 33647, correct. Yep. Okay. Just let me add the card. Okay. And then we could do due date. Okay. Do you want me to go ahead and process these two now then for you? I think I have a – yeah, go ahead. I believe I just transferred some money in there. Okay. Yeah, I transfer as needed to. Gotcha. Okay. So it takes a moment for me to tell if it actually went through. If it does, it's going to be sending you receipts here in just a moment. Okay. Yeah, I was talking to my sales rep at one point when we were doing the contract. We believe that I might be your oldest active customer right now. Oh, really? 20, like 25 years. Wow. And actually, even before that, I beta tested PC Recruiter with a management recruiter's office way back when. And I was part of the select committee. Well, I've been here 20 years. And yeah, we're old timers now, right? I was an MRI person before that. Oh, were you really? Yeah. I've trained, let's see, MRI wear. taps? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. No doubt. And then PCR. Yeah, I did two stints with MRI. One was a boutique office that we started off and I sold another one. I wasn't getting credit. I was like, I should get some of that referral first. You know, telling all these PCRs. Now, okay, so it's saying decline. Let me see if I can tell what it tells me. I just transferred money to that account though. Tell me why. I mean. You have to maybe approve it on your end? Let me look at our account. I don't know if I can see it. I don't know if I can see it. I don't know if I can see it. I don't know if I can see it.

Ebel Bay Recruiters LLC card ends in 4809 expiration date 0626 right let me just pull it back out real quick I got it ahead of me there uh Yeah, 08 of 26 or 809, correct? Oh, 08 of 26 or 0626? 0826.

I need one for July. Maybe I put in the expiration date wrong. You said it's 08? 08 of 26. I got to turn this off. Hold on one second. I got to turn it off. Update customer. Then I can go to stored payment method. Then go here. and then, well, I'm at least seeing a delete option. Let me see if it allows me to. Okay. Oh, that's good. Either they changed my securities or I wasn't going to the right place to do it. Okay. So it was Robert, A-E-B-E-L. Yep. And then... A Recruiters LLC. A Recruiters LLC. Okay, card number. I'm so sorry about this. I put in the date wrong, apparently. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so Do you need the card number again?
