    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Scott Samuels. You just emailed me about some parameters for a search. Yeah. What are you trying to determine? I guess, what do you need from me? I thought I'd call you instead. Oh, sure. Yeah. So I just want to be able to run the report on my end. So when you're running the repeat client report, what are the parameters you put in for date range? And do you select a roll up list before you run the report? Yeah. So so there is there is a report already created under name custom name reports for repeat client. Right. You want to use that? Yeah. And so when you click on that, it asks you, what's your date range? Oh, actually, I don't put date range. All I do is select. You can select the report is AT and then repeat. I think it's a space. That's the roll-up, you mean? Yeah, that's the roll-up name, yeah. Okay. Let's see. AT. Should be like 42 names. Yeah, let's go to your roll-ups. most recent of are you saying a t as in tom um yeah okay we do at space re re oh at repeat clients got it okay awesome so yeah no date range you just uh select that roll up that makes sense awesome all right i mean the issue the issue i think if it was explained was that I went into, I wanted to include the last activity. So I basically copied the last activity as much as I could and put it into QuickNote and added the QuickNote to that, to the custom report. And when I did that and I printed the report, it changed all the activity dates to the date I changed, you know, I updated it, right? So, which is not what I wanted. And so I went back and I deleted from the activities all the activities that were added because of that. And then I thought that that would fix the problem. And I re-ran the report and the activity date didn't change. So then I went in to try to delete from the recycle bin those activities and it wouldn't let me delete them. I don't know why that was sort of a glitch. But so now, that's all right. So you probably know all that. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, I just wanted to be able to let the tech team run the report when they're testing and trying to resolve this situation. So knowing what roll-up list you ran it on will help for sure. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. All right. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.",
