    "text": " Good morning, Maid Sequence. Good morning. This is Linda Fox. I was trying to reach Patsy Lombardo in case she's available. Okay. She is no longer with the company, actually. Is there something I can do to help? Yes, sir. Okay. By chance, I landed up here because I believe I was going with the directory. I was calling about the Fidelity Retirement Plan, sir. And then are you now handling the fidelity plan for main sequence? I am not. I don't really actually know who would be handling that. Okay. Is there any direction who has replaced that maybe? Not directly, but let me see if I can get your information on one of our owners to see who would be. Elena, what is your best number or email? What's your preferred method of contact? So I can be best reached by my cell phone. It's 561-565-6959. And then I just had a fiduciary matter to discuss with Patsy on the Fidelity plan for Main Sequence Technology Incorporated. I'm taking a note that she's not with the business anymore, so whoever has replaced her can give me a call. Okay, very well. And it's for the business, not her personal, right? No, it's for Main Sequence Technology Incorporated. There's a report that needs to go out to them. Okay, very well. I will pass your information along to our ownership team, see who's the best contact. All right, thank you so much. I appreciate it, sir. My pleasure. Thank you. Thanks. Okay, bye-bye.",
