    "text": " Hello, this is George. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. Hi, Garrett. I spoke with Dustin, and everything looks like it's in good shape. He said that he hasn't touched any of those settings yet. Right. So that's in good shape. And I went into PCR under your username, and I created a name record for myself and sent myself an email, and it showed up in the email inbox right away. So it does look like PCR is working. You can send out emails, which led Dustin and I to believe that maybe Vario, your email provider, had a temporary outage where you weren't able to send. But it also meant that we updated your password and re-input it into PCR earlier today. Okay. Might have been what fixed it as well, but you are in good shape. You should be able to send email out from PCR moving forward. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, these things happen at the wrong time. Today happens to be a day of a lot of urgent, you know, business activity. So anyway, I appreciate you jumping all over this, Garrett. Appreciate your work. Yeah, happy to help. I'm glad it's working for you again. If you do notice anything where it's offline again or something else happens, just give us a call and let us know. We'll take a look. Okay. Yeah, real quickly, just a quick update. Are you in, with Main Sequence, are you in the Cleveland, Ohio area? Yeah. Yeah, we're in Willoughby, Mentor, kind of suburbs of Cleveland. Yeah, I had my original training, you know, for MRI, Management Recruiters International, 20 years ago in downtown Cleveland. And amazing how time flies. But, yeah, I'm just solo now, you know, trying to be semi-retired, but business is so good. Hey, that's amazing. Yeah, yeah, business is so overwhelmingly good. My wife says, yeah, just keep sending me those checks, you know, when they come in. That's awesome. Yeah. So how long have you been with Main Secrets? I've only been here for about two years. and yeah so we I didn't know any of the downtown Cleveland offices just the kind of the suburbs one that they moved out to right yeah I think I may be holding a record here on using PCR email you know for that length of time I think a lot of people just jump over to Outlook you know but right I figure if it works my my fix is it's been working so I'm stayed with it but again appreciate the good service awesome yes happy to help anytime all right garrett enjoy the rest of your monday and thanks again you're welcome have a great day hey okay goodbye",
