    "text": " Thank you for calling Crystal Lusk. Hello, you've reached the voicemail for Crystal Lusk with Connectology. I'm either on another call or away from my desk. Please leave a message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thank you and have a great day. Hi, Crystal. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I was reaching out because you have a card set up for auto pay and it's been declining. I sent some emails that I just figured I would reach out to you by phone to make sure I'm missing those emails. So there are three invoices that are now open, the July 12th, August 12th, and September 12th invoices. Those are all three open. If you have the new invoices, you should be able to pay through those. But if you want, we could update the card over the phone, and I can set up auto pay with a new card. Give me a call when you have a moment. My number is 440-946-5214. I'm at extension 5466. Again, it's Robin Montoni, and I'm with Main Sequence, 440-946-5214, extension 5466. And hope to talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.",
