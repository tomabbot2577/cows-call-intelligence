    "text": " Hello, this is Brian. Brian, this is Dylan Andrews with Russ Attic Associates. How are you? Good, Dylan. What's going on? Well, I am attempting to try out your AI on our PCR database, and it's not allowing me to do it. What did tech support say? I can't get okay somebody just texted me and said thank you I'm able to nope that was somebody else my bad I couldn't get a hold of anybody that's the answer so I'm trying to follow the prompts on your website here it says go to do you know prompt one here hit this button to get to somebody on the phone so somehow it got me to you so I'd love to go Okay, so I'm in sales. You hit one, and that gets you to sales. And unfortunately, you got forwarded out to my cell phone because I'm out of the office. So I can't ring you back to support. But if you hit option two, when you dial that main number instead of one, you get tech support. If you don't get an answer, it means they're probably helping somebody else leave voicemail. You can also send an email to support at main sequence dot net. That will automatically open up a ticket. So that has to be resolved. So that's beneficial. Well, I did that yesterday and it did not and has not been contacted since yesterday. I apologize. That's a bummer. what part of which of the four AI sections are you trying to utilize I don't know they said that there's AI now for PCR so I'm trying to use anything have you requested that it be turned on in your database yet have we it was supposed to be supposed to be turned on but it's still not available oh okay so let me let's do this go to a name record. Okay. And you may or may not have this on your menu, but the summary section, if you could, it may be under edit name, notes, activities, that, that menu, but it may not be pinned. You may have to hit the three arrow, three lines. I went there. Okay. So the summary, the very last, icon on that menu is our is a version of our new image it's a hexagon are you seeing that yeah okay so what happens in the summary section if you click that it will create a summary of starting with of that person's record starting with their resume I believe it will also grab attachments and information in their field level so that's the first section that's the first area where AI plays part second area is searching so if you go that's what I want bar at the top if you go click on the bar the search bar at the top of the screen I'm there yeah okay and then you see the AI button and if you click that on no there's no a okay so this is not was the ai button in the summary section yeah okay okay but that's not okay interesting um let's do this um So, I'm going to say, was your first name Dylan? I apologize. Yeah, that's correct. Okay. I'm going to say, Dylan, that it probably hasn't been turned on yet. even though you're seeing it in that summary section. If it's not in the, if you don't see the AI button in the top left-hand corner of the quick search box when you click on that search box. Okay, so it hasn't, something somehow has not been turned on for you yet. So, Dylan, what was your last name? Andrews. I'm with SRA and Next Level Exchange is the name of the company that we all work with. So, Brian Denton is the one. If you could, Dylan, you are not in our database. is the name of the office that you are in? Russ Haddock Associates. Okay. Once again, we're under SRA, Sanford Road Associates. Right. Do you normally go through SRA for PCR support or do you normally call us directly? Well, we usually, they have abilities, their support team has abilities to do some things in PCR for us, but sometimes I have to go directly to main sequence for an answer. So that's the answer to that. Got it. So, Russ Haddock, H-A-D-D, I would assume. Not seeing that. One D. Is there another? One D. One D. R-U-S-S-H-A-D-I-T-K-A-N-D, Associates. I'm sorry, Dylan. I don't know what you were saying there. I wasn't tracking that. Could you start again? Russ space Haddock with one D. Okay. space a and got it found it found it thank you okay thank you apologize i was i was so that was the yeah you're good you're good all right um okay and you said you sent an email into support at Main Sequence asking to turn on it. Brian Denton did. Brian Denton did. Great. Okay. And copied me on it and Bob Haddock. Oh, that would be... Yeah. That's awesome. Would you mind forwarding that to me so I could utilize that to try and help get this resolved for you? My email is Brian, B-R-I-A-N at Brian M as in Michael Cain, C A I N E.com. So it's Brian at Brian M Cain.com C A I N E. You don't have a main sequence email. I do, but that's the one I use. I'm a contractor for them. I'm not an employee. I've been a contractor for them for 20 years. So I just use my own email and I have services I provide, you know, tech support, training and consultation, maximizing PCR, that kind of thing. So that's my goal or that's one of the things I was doing. So if you can send that over. Not to be rude, but I don't feel comfortable sending it to a domain that I'm not currently in business with. Cool. Send it to bcaine at main sequence dot net. B-C-A-I-N-E at main sequence dot net. I'm sorry. I hope you understand. Totally good. okay there we go i just forwarded it to you it says ai tools not accessible is the subject and then our database id is in the body of the email so you can find you have that okay yeah yeah so i can use that email that will help me uh get this uh um Prioritized. Exploited. Yep, exactly. Sorry, my brain was... It's all right. We're good. Well, I appreciate you helping me walk through that. I mean, already, that's an astoundingly good function. The summary function was freaking awesome. Yeah, I like the summary piece. So if you have a good resume, that really helps. yeah I'm going to try it again on somebody who has very detailed information I got a lot of data on this guy yeah I mean fantastic so so so here's what I'm going to do Dylan I'm going to take your email and I'm going to forward it to support at main sequence dot net which will turn it into a ticket I don't believe the ticket will be associated because the email was coming from me. I looked under Russ Haddock and Associates, and I don't see a ticket for installing AI. Doesn't mean Brian didn't do it or request it, but it's not under your company name. So this will put it under your company name. I'm going to be like, make sure AI is turned on. Do you need training on the AI? I mean, it doesn't require a ton of training. It's pretty intuitive, but we can provide a little bit of assistance on that. I mean, why not? I mean, the training might end faster than everybody else with me because I already use Grok really well. So, I mean, I'm very familiar with AI. I'm sure that there's a couple of things I can learn though. I don't know. I don't know. I'm not going to say I shouldn't. If you're going over stuff I already know, I'll just tell you and then move stuff along. Does that work for you? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's totally cool. So, like I said, I'm going to forward your email and make it a ticket and then internally work to make sure that AI is completely turned on on your database. And then from that point, hopefully one of us on our end will notify you. But keep checking the one area, the search box, you know, just every once a day or so. Just check that because once we turn it on, you'll see search and then you'll see AI in there. So, okay. Cool. Yeah. Thanks. I think the rest of my office really needs training on AI. I don't know that any of them, maybe one person knows how to use ChatGPT. They were using it. um i prefer grok because i think it's the best out there but that's just my opinion i don't know what your model has done it um i was i was actually gonna propose like an api um with grok but um if you guys have developed one then all the better you know correct yep hopefully that is the case and uh it we just continue to crank it out okay well i appreciate your time a lot thank you very much yeah no problem uh i will be bird dogging this for you until uh we get this uh rolling all right okay thank you yep talk to you soon take care down bye",
