    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Mr. Tyler. It's Tom Zeleny calling from Denver. I have a quick question for you. I'm looking for the download for the PCR app. I deleted it because I thought I wanted to do the web-based version, but that's turned into my latest hemorrhoid. so I want the app back but I don't know where to get it because I don't see it on the PCR downloads page. So the only app that we have is like the mobile app. To access PC Recruiter any other way you just go to your web URL. Right. Okay. Well maybe I was using the mobile app on my PC. You wouldn't be able to. it's Android or Apple specific okay well I did have a little shortcut that I had on my taskbar that I would click to and it would open PCR in a window that would stay open and it didn't have the ww2 PCR all that other stuff at the top so it It kept all of that Chrome extension stuff off of my screen. How would I have done that? That I am not sure. What kind of computer are you on? Just a PC. Okay. Unless you logged in and created some kind of odd shortcut. Well, when I try to add a shortcut, it does it for the Chrome application. And every time I click on the shortcut on my nav bar, it opens up a new version of PCR. And the old one I had, I would just click on the nav on the nav bar, and it would pull up the screen that I had opened. I'm trying to see here. You know what? I found it in some old downloads. So it's the PC Recruiter HTML interface. Let me see here. I think I solved it while we've been talking. unless that's like one of the old old versions of pc recruiter well it opens up the current version of pcr wow let me take a look Could you send me that link? Sure. I'm interested in that now. It's awesome. So the nice thing about it is you have it on your nav bar in a certain place, and you've got 8,000 windows open, and you want to go to PCR. You just click on the app, and it'll pull up the screen that's open, the PCR screen that's open. if you because what I was trying to do was to create a shortcut with the web version and when you do that it will bury it amongst all your other Chrome tabs so then you have to like scroll through all of those and try to figure out which ones PCR and that's a real pain in the butt when you're like on the phone trying to negotiate with a client and a candidate you need to pull the information real fast. Yeah. Could you send me that link to ttroutman at main sequence dot net? I'm not sure I'm using something. funky there To travel and I'm just going to call it my PC our That's P. R. A. I've got it. I mean, yeah, I think I've sent you stuff before so I'm canadians attachments that are potentially unsafe recipients using Microsoft Outlook may not be able to open do you want to send anyway sure you know it's coming from me Undeliverable. T-T-R-A-U-T-M-A-N at main sequence dot net? Yep. Yeah. This message was blocked because it presents a potential security issue. Interesting. Interesting. Well, I've been using it for years, and it works great. But it's way faster and better than trying to make a shortcut, because I just basically went to the WW2 PCR company name, all that other stuff, did the three dots on Chrome, and then let's see. I'll walk you through all my steps. All right, so you do that. You do the three dots on Chrome, and then you go down to Cast, Save, and Share, and then you create shortcut, and when you create it, then I save that to my desktop, and then I dropped, well, I had to make a couple of changes to that under the target because at the end of the web information, you have to have two hyphens and then the word new and then one hyphen and the word window, and you save it as that, and then you can drop and drag it into your taskbar. I see what you did there now. Well, that's for the Chrome extension, and that's the one that I hate. So when you do it that way, whenever you click on that, it'll open up a brand new window that says PCR, which I don't want. I want to have the window that I've already had open. I just need to click on that and bring it back to the front of my screen. So the HTML that I was sending you is that. yeah what's the is it like a you said it was a you had it in your downloads yes let me see let me pull that back up again it is called pc recruiter html interface and it's a shortcut and it's three kilobytes And I downloaded that in 2018, and I've been using it ever since, and it's great. Yeah. And does it take you to the PCR 9 screen or to the 8 screen? Let me see. I'm going to close out of PCR. Oh, shit. Where did that go? I didn't pin it. Okay, hold on. open my recycle bin put it back drag it down link it takes me to the login screen um let me see There's all kinds of updates. It says system maintenance. Where do I find out what version it is? Do you use – when it says what's new over on the right, does it say like the PCR capture update 1.2? Yep. PCR AI suite. I mean, I can do a screen share if you want. Yeah, let's talk about a screen share. Okay. I just want to make sure you're not going to something that's vulnerable. okay what's that you want me to go to I'll send you a link make it easier okay All right, I just emailed that link on over to you. link got it manual there will be a blue box at the bottom of that meeting window we have share yep I'm sharing perfect okay so just delete that so it's this so what I can do is I click on this and it opens this okay can you click the three dots up to the top right hand corner no it was in there go ahead and open up yeah all right good good just minimize this for a second for me on that HTML interface, can you right-click and hit properties? Go to details up at the top for me. My visual signatures. Nothing there. My general. Oh, I see what it's doing. Okay, yeah, you're good. So the way you have that file saved, how it's like that type of file, that shortcut, that file type. So it's still running through Chrome. it's just running a simplified version of Chrome. Okay so like when I open it up it looks different than if I open this one. So you can see the difference I don't have all this crap at the top. Yep yeah that's so simplified version of Chrome part yeah so I basically I have more real estate on here that I can see more stuff but if I go into say like the other one I have to look and find out which one is PCR if if I'm using a Chrome extension this one I just click on it and it'll take me right back to wherever I was yep I see exactly what you're doing now yeah so this is like way faster I was trying to make this one work like this one so that way when I have a bunch of different tabs open like I'm in I'm in this tab and then it's like oh wait I want PCR all I have to do is just click on this and it's boom it's right there and I don't have to go to like okay which tab was it was it that one no it's that one no it's a bell there's PCR but the downfall with this vert or the good part about this version is it'll work with source whale and the other version will not like this one I don't have like if I look at the puzzle pieces and I go to source whale open side panel it doesn't work if I could get this to work on this version it would be beautiful so think of that's not going to happen unfortunately right that's why that's why I downloaded this one I was like well I'll just use that but every time I I click on it, I have to log in again. Yeah, so it does that for security purposes, for like new session IDs. Okay. So, in this version, if you click that lightning bolt icon, in the simplified version, Oh. And hit name. And then parse from resume. And then start. Oh, launcher does work on that one. That's nice. But yeah, with this simplified version of Chrome, it's essentially running a version close to like a tablet version. Okay. Of Chrome. And extensions aren't supported there. Okay. Well, I'll just keep this one up. I shouldn't say up. I'll keep it on the taskbar. So if there is a person that, like, I want to do source whale on, I'll just log in. and then I'll just go to the person that way. And then I can do source whale. And then it works on this person on this version. It just doesn't work on this. Yeah, that's the same old one. Yeah, it doesn't work on that version. But there is significant value, at least for me, when I have all kinds of windows open. If I ever want, well, I go to PCR probably 100 times a day. So if I'm working on another document or something like that, I just want to go to PCR, I just click on this, boom, it's up. I can go back to my document. I can go back to whatever I'm working on. But PCR is always available. Yeah, it is nifty. It took me a little bit to figure it out. The main reason is I wanted to make sure you weren't running an older version of PC Recruiter that was deprecated. Because we deprecated it for security issues. Okay. Just because it was based on very old software and very old browsers that weren't very safe. This is technically running Chrome. so you won't have to worry about that issue that I was worried about. Okay. Well, I guess that's my little workaround hack to always have PCR front and center. Yep. Yeah, it's a nice little one. You're the first person I've ever seen do it. Boom. You always have PCR. You never have to search for it. So someone calls you and you're in a different program or application, like I was saying. You're in a Teams meeting or something like that, and someone's on PCR. are you just click it and it's there yeah well that's a nifty little trick I also remember that one well for once I can share some information that is new to support and more than happy to help yeah we appreciate it awesome well thank you Tyler appreciate the walkthrough and help with making sure that I'm safe and secure and not a problem if you need anything else come just let us know okay Sounds like a plan. Thank you. Yep. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye.",
