    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Chris W. at MedBest. How's it going? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Happy Monday. Happy Monday. Hey, I have an unusual kind of wonky thing that is going on in PCR with jobs, and I just figured it might be easier for me to call and tell you what's happening. Okay. So when we are putting through EPOs or SOs through the job in PCR, like when we link a candidate or we update the EPO or SO activity and then we hit save, PCR acts like it's not doing anything when you hit save. So people are clicking again because nothing's going on. And what's happening, Robin, is because PCR seems like it's doing nothing upon that initial click, there's duplication of the EPOs and SOs happening in the system. We used to get like a refresh or like some type of like, I forget exactly what it was, but it's not doing that on the initial click anymore. And so, like I said, we have these. I wonder if there's just like maybe database sites. What database is this? MedVest Recruiting. Yep. What username should I check? You can check You can check B. Yocum It just happened to Brianna It just happened to her So you can check B. Yocum Can I go in as admin? You have an admin username, right? Okay Yeah, yeah What's an example of a position? An example would be New Martinsville The Hill Valley, New Martinsville That's Is that a company or I'm sorry, Robin. What are you asking? I misunderstood your question. Okay. So actually, what's a person's name, a candidate name where it's happened to? Rhonda Pitsnagel. P-I-T-S, last name, N-O-G-L-E. Let's see. Okay. So I see a link name, an EPO interview, and a send out first interview. Yeah, it's all fixed, Robin. So there's no, you're not going to see anything. Everything's been fixed. Yeah. Let me see here. Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and click on the link. Let me just check how many pipeline records are. 29,000, not too bad. I expected more. I have the candidate that it just happened with, but same thing, Rob and Bree already fixed it. Okay. Do we have... Do we have... Let me get your database. Bear with me one second. A lot of times I'm in databases from prior testing or just showing something. Let me see. Okay. Do you mind if I link myself to the job and... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Give it a shot? Okay. Sure. I see you did have me in there. So if you go to pipeline and then you're doing APO, now are they doing a drag and drop or using an action ad? I think we're doing the action ad. We're not doing drag and drop. Okay. So APO interview. I'll just do it for whatever date and time. Yeah, like just try APO. And then you'll see what I mean when you hit save. Hopefully. I see that the second one was created. No issue. The only thing that doesn't update is where you see under the interview column, view one. You don't see that refresh until you refresh your pipeline. And then if I do a drag and drop the first interview, now that does automatically refresh. It's when you use action add that it doesn't automatically refresh. I do not have a problem. Well, like I said, we typically, we're not dragging and dropping. We're typically selecting the dropdown, like when we're adding the activity. so the issue is that doesn't refresh automatically when you do that the issue is is when we add the activity like ep or so and then hit save it doesn't the screen does absolutely nothing so people are clicking again and then when it clicks again is like when it refreshes or resets or it like seems like it's taking but in reality once you close that screen it actually took the first time when the users are hitting save. And it just started doing this last week. And again, Robin, forgive me. I don't recall exactly what happened with PCR in normal situations, but that's what's going on, is it looks like there's nothing happening when you're hitting save anymore. So when I did it, I saw a green save successful appear at the top. Okay, that's not happening. That's not happening. All right. Okay, so that tells me, let's see. Could we do a screen share? Sure. Okay, because I want to see, because it said that for me. So I wonder if you need to like clear cash or something. Could be. Well, it's happened to, it could be, but it's happened to all of us now. So, and we've been cleaning up duplicates all week. I'm like, what the heck is going on? And then I put through an EPO Friday night, and it happened to me. I was like, oh, my gosh, this is what's going on. Okay, yeah, let me see what's going on. What could be a little bit different? It seems fine on mine. I just want to kind of see it. Okay. We want me to log me in one, two, three? No, I don't have access to that. I'm going to do a Google Meet. And what is your email address? It's cwiseman. Okay. W-I-S-E-M-A-N at medbest.com okay yeah I'm going to forget even be like outdated Java or something like that that could also be another thing okay sent you an email do you want me to hang up here no that's okay you can stay on just mute your meeting okay okay And then what I'm going to have you do is click share screen, which is at the bottom. It's the rectangle with arrow. Yep, I got you. And then go over to entire screen. Yeah, so let's do a stop present. Like stop presenting. So when you hit share screen, go over to the right where it says entire screen. Oh, got it. Okay. Just in case we need to look at. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got you. Or Java, you never know. Okay. so we can just keep playing with my record if you go over to your PCR database yep you just want to put you through I've actually already in that one is that the same job yeah okay so if you go to pipeline we should see me okay I see you all right so go to action add and then just pick one of them I'm doing this though. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. That's weird. Okay. Let's do this. I'm going to delete. Can I delete this from the pipeline? Absolutely. I'm trying a different job. Hold on. now what doesn't update is if you are using action add you'll still see the last one until you click pipeline again okay where if you're dragging and dropping then it does refresh okay hang tight let me do robin what's your m-a-r-t m-a-m-o-n-t sorry m-o-n-t sorry that's okay All right. So let's put Robin through as a studio PO. I know it's going to work. It's just because you're on the phone. What does that say? It said this is going to trigger an email activity. I don't know why it says that, but okay, so it worked. I want to say an automation plan associated with it. Okay, so it worked. Well, dang. Okay. It's not happening. I was a little confused on there when I'm like, I don't know. Yeah. I guess what I'll do, Robin, is I will let the team know that it appears to be working to give PCR a second to see that green confirmation that word says successful before clicking save again. Let me just send that out first. And if there's specific screenshots or examples that I can get from them, I'll follow up and share them with you. But otherwise, I think in this case, I'm just going to let them know, give it a second for that green message, and then it should be avoiding the duplication. And then the other thing I would recommend, too, is just remind them that when you drag and drop, that reloads the screen. but if you're doing the action add maybe once you save it hit pipeline again and then you'll see like that view column that would increase and then you'll see the date and the stage can you show me the drag and drop so drag and drop would be like so drag and drop is fine unless you're scheduling so let's say if you want to put me under send out first interview you just Yeah. My name. Yeah. And then drag it to that subfolder. Oh, my gosh. Are you serious? Yeah. You can do that with any of them. Yep. Except for placements you can't do. Oh, my gosh. I didn't know that. So, wait. Let me drop you an SO. Hold on. I really recommend to always drag to the subfolder because that's what fills in as the status. Robin, this has changed. This is a game changer. Maybe I'm the only one that doesn't know this, but. Now, usually if you're doing like I'm scheduling an interview, you want to use action add because you want to go in and put in like, let's see what action add does. Yeah. So drag and drop, basically what it does is it uses the same date and time that you're dragging. But for type and status, it's just changing the whatever main and subfolder you drag to. Where if you go to add, what people will do that for is to change the appointment date, as an example. Like I'm scheduling it now, but the interview is actually happening, you know, Wednesday at 11 o'clock. Yeah. With that being said, Robin, I think I am going to stick to what we normally do because I don't want to throw off our SO, you know, timelines and stamps. Right. Now, if you're just moving out of process, for example, and you maybe had reasons underneath it, like why I was so much out of process, then you're not scheduling anything. So then you would just drag and drop them. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. That's cool. That's cool to know. Okay. Yeah, but maybe just let them know when you're doing action add, after you save it, you should see that green banner, but it doesn't refresh the list until you hit, like, see how you see pipeline? Yeah. Right between edit position and roll ups. Yeah. If you click that again, then it'll update. It'll refresh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right, Robin. Well, maybe, maybe I just needed to call you for it to work. I don't know. Could be, you know, your left leg is, you know, behind the right one when you're sitting. It could be. It could be. Well, Robin, thank you so much. I appreciate you. You are welcome. Have a good week. You too. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye.",
