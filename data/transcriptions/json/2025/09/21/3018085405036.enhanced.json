    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Glenn Gardner. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Good, good. I had a quick question. I am trying to find kind of people that are very dead in my database, and I really don't know, like I said, with this new AI stuff and all this stuff. You know, if I'm looking in, if I go in the names record and put in, you know, a few keywords, I get, you know, a zillion people, but I'm just trying to figure out new ways to find people that haven't been touched, if that made sense. Okay. Yeah. So let's see if you have the AI search turned on for your database. I think I do because I just got an email for it. So we had upgraded our system, and then business really sucks for us. So I downgraded my system and then realized we couldn't send bulk email. We could, but it was very time-consuming. So we upgraded our system back, and I just got to think about this AI. So that's why I was calling. Oh, sure. Yeah, so we've released an AI free trial for three AI features, which is AI job summary, AI candidate summary, and AI email generator. The fourth one, though, AI search. And once again, I'm not interested. I think I've had those and tried it before, and that really wasn't my forte, so I'm more interested in search. Okay, gotcha. So the AI search isn't automatically turned on on your database. It'll have to be requested because certain databases don't have the Lucene search engine built into them. Mine did. I think I upgraded that in the past. I remember paying for something with this Lucene thing. Oh, okay. I'm pulling that up. But I don't know. Who knows what I have? Like I said, I've been with you for 25 years, so it's kind of hard to understand what I have and what I don't have. Okay, yeah, I'm looking right now and you do have Lucene. Excellent. So I can actually right now, I'm going to turn on your AI search in your database since you have all the right parts here. And so what you'll need to do is probably log out of PCR and log back in in order to see the AI search tool. Okay. Reload. Hold on a second. I'm smart enough to do that. Barely. Okay. Gotcha. All right. All right. I'm there. And then if you use the quick search up at the top right of PCR, you should see a toggle to turn on AI. Okay. Yep. And that'll give you a guide where it gives you, you know, a starting place on how do you formulate your questions and your sentences to the AI where it makes most sense. And it even gives you a couple examples as a starting place. But for the one you're asking about, you might want to start with something like show me name records with a last activity in 2024 or a last activity in 2020. If you want to go back further, maybe something along those lines. And it'll show you some people with those with that qualification. OK, so let's start. So I just hit this suggestion for interviews. reviews. So I just put it in this recent searches or search. Where do I type this? Go up to the top in that gray bar across the top in the search bar. That's where you can type in your sentence. Oh, okay. So you're typing in the search bar, not in the keyword. right yeah the AI was just turned on towards that inherently not obvious but that's okay that's why we're on the phone okay well I and then how can it just search names instead of companies or end position was that a legitimate question so I guess absolutely show me plus entities criteria so yes let's show me names maybe yeah so you could say show me names with last activity in 2020 or something like that and it'll most likely be able to pull that back for you okay yeah I'm doing that right now okay so 200 my name came up that shouldn't be these are all show me last show me names of last activity in 2020 that i totally didn't do anything because it you know it just showed me a lady that i just sent an email received today so all these things are very recent it did it just the opposite okay so try putting um last activity Before 2020, maybe? Before 2020. Okay. So just trying to get this right. Before. In 2020. E-F-R-E. Well, that just gave me – it popped up with the person I just emailed two seconds ago. So we're doing it exactly opposite of what you said. Okay. So are you still using that search bar up at the top right, or are you doing anything with the basic search on the left? Nope. Let's actually take a look together. I'm going to jump on a screen share with you and see what's going on there. I'm not trying to be an asshole or anything. I'm just saying it. Oh, no, no. This is all wild, wild west for all of us, right? Exactly. So in a new tab in your browser, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. ID, please. That is 778-843-629. Join a meeting? Meeting ID. Asking for the ID again. It brought me to the central. Oh, that makes sense. Okay. So that's 778-843-6262. nine okay I've allowed as a loud joint audio to go without audio okay so we're there so perfect just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top I'm going to go screen one because that's what PC recruiter is on. Okay, there we go. Okay. You see that? All right, so show me name. Show me name for the last activity. Gotcha. All right, and it had 21,000 results. Okay, that shouldn't be – yeah, and it looks like their last activities are 2025. I see that too. So, okay, let me try formulating one in my test database here. Actions, status, skills. Okay. Show me names I haven't contacted. Check this person's email. Yeah, I'm not sure. We could just play around with it. Try putting in – I was doing show me names that haven't been emailed in six months. But let's see what – okay, show me candidates, physical science. show me candidates with physical science background and an engineering degree so i mean that's really what i need so let's see what we have let's see what this pulls us up no relevant findings see that that's insane too because i have if i go down here and put in physical science. If I go down here and put in this in quotation marks, and then do I need to put the word and in capital letters? Yep. So this is what I'm trying to find. So if I hit this search here. yeah 130 me up so uh how do i get rid of this stupid thing uh you would click up to the left of the search bar in the gray area or the right of the search bar there you got it so so here so it's like all these people that have linked to positions obviously we've talked to all them that's why they're coming up because of the lucid search right then if we go out here to seven I mean, I know what I'm doing a little bit, but not really. So it's like, Dean Thomas. So, you know, so then how do I take all these people and see Robin, so Chris, like Robin, like, well, what does Robin do here? So one, is she on a roll-up? Yes, she's on a roll-up. So, you know, Chris Avecchio, roll-up. He's on life science software. So I'm just trying to find on this list who the hell hasn't been talked to. Okay. Okay. Let's see. So I wonder if you could do, let's see, names on a roll-up who have not been called or emailed. I'll just have to try it out in my database. I mean, if you just want to play, so I don't want to, if you just want to play, this is not a dire urgency to me, but I would like to know more about this. So if you want to play around with my database and kind of see, so basically, if you, I'm going to send you over, I'm sorry, Matt, what's your last name? My name's Garrett is the first name. Oh, Garrett, I'm sorry. No worries. What's your last name? It starts with K-O-M as in Michael. Okay, so there you go. That's right. I'm going to send you this. And if you can kind of pop open that position description, this is just more for learning. You know, this is not the most critical thing, but I'm just trying to learn more shit in your system, obviously. Okay, yeah. So I think I know what we can do to perform that search kind of outside of the AI. The AI is more just a lot of trial and error and seeing what it understands, understands, what it's learning as it's growing. But outside of the AI search, you can perform that advanced search or that keyword search that you just performed. And then we can take a look at the last activity date on all those results. So let's do that first. So if you just go back to name in the main menu up at the top, and then on the left, enter those keywords again, how you did before. I thought so, and... Engineering. Okay, search. Search. Okay. And then what I would do is I would put all of these names on a roll-up list, and go and select all. I can do that, so roll up names. Roll up names. We're going to go add roll up. Excellent. A-I. Excellent. And then what we can do next is build a... It just ignored everybody. That's weird. Oh, that is weird. Click on the zero again under name. I'm not doing very well today, am I? No, you're doing good. Yeah, so it has the 134 on there. That looks like it was a weird glitch there. So now we can build an advanced search. Oh, it could be. Okay. So now we could build an advanced search that says everyone on this roll-up list, show me where their last activity is before a certain date. So you can go back to your main PC recruiter tab and go to... I'll close this. Perfect. Okay. So do I need the name of that roll-up list? We'll be able to pick it out. Yeah, it's the AI WashU test. Perfect. So go to advanced on the left there next to where it says basic search. Oh, wait. Hold on a second. On the left. Advanced. So, yeah, you could close that pop-up. So where it says basic search in green. Okay. There you go. Perfect. Expand that first heading that says search params. Okay. And then in that first dropdown where it says predefined fields, switch that to name rollup. So it's the dropdown to the left of that one that says. predefined fields. Okay. Perfect. Yep. Scroll down. It'll say name roll-up as one of your options. What, the next one over? No, it's the predefined fields drop down. Oh, okay. Name roll-up. Perfect. And we have on list selected. Perfect. And then use that little pop-out icon to the right to select the roll-up you want to use as part of your criteria. There you go. Yep. So that's one line of the criteria. And then the next line, we will go up. You can leave it as predefined fields there, but change where it says first name. Change that to last activity. Perfect. And then in the drop-down where it says like, change that to less than. So we want things before a certain date, so less than. And then you can enter a date there, maybe January 1st of a certain year or, you know, however you want to do that. Can we put less than 2004? Should I just put 2004 or do I need to put an actual date? It'll need an actual date. So you can say January 1st, 2024. So do I need to put one? Do I need to put 01? What do I? I would put 1 slash 1 slash 2024. That should do it. Hit add next to that. Yep. So now you have both of those stacked up. The two criteria is the name is on the list and the last activity is before that January 1st, 2024. Then you can hit the search at the top right. Exactly. Yep. Magnifying glass. And that is three people. Three people on that list. Their last activity was before 2024. Lordy. Okay. That's funny because Rick Smith, because he's a dipshit, we took him off. So that makes sense. So roll up, not unroll up. That makes sense. And then he's probably not unroll up either. Yes. They were, but the only two dead ones that weren't. This wasn't, I can't say I'm in love with this thing, but we went through an exercise and, yep, that's that. Okay, well, like I said, I'll have to keep poking around. Maybe I'll figure out and give you guys a shout tomorrow or something. So it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. What we did today was a combination of a keyword search and an advanced search, and we did not end up using the AI search feature at all. Like I said, that one is a lot of trial and error, seeing what sentences it understands up at the top right there. So that'll take a little bit of experimenting. But there is a thumbs up or thumbs down that you can rate the search results each time to help it grow more intelligent around your database. So feel free to use the thumbs up or thumbs down. And feel free to take a look. If you could do a query, you know, if you have time or something. Look at our job description and try to figure out if you can get me some new candidates. I'm grasping for straws right now, but we're basically on the verge of, I wouldn't say bankruptcy, but really, it's that bad in this world right now because I'm in higher ed. Like I said, Donald Trump is attacking higher ed quite bad, so I'm trying to knock shit out for my clients while we're still here. That makes sense. Yeah. And also, I'm very sorry to hear about Justin Manning. Oh, Jared. Jared. I'm getting all kinds of names confused. No, that's all right. I've worked with him for, you know, a zillion years. Oh, wow. Very, very sad. He had kidney problems or something? Right, yeah, some kind of kidney disease, yeah. So sad, too soon. Polycystic kidney fibrosis or something? I think so. That sounds right. I didn't know the exact term, but that's, yep, that sounds right. Because Marty posted something on Facebook, and that's how I kind of heard about that. Oh, gotcha. I don't know. Did you realize how long I've been with PC Recruiter? I don't know if you know that or not, but I've been with you guys. No, I didn't realize, yeah. Yeah, if you've been working with Jared so long, that's pretty awesome you've been around so long. It's stuck with us. I'm one of your first clients. Like, I've been with you guys for, like, almost 25 years. That's amazing. Yeah, so, and like I said, you know, Marty and Michael and Bill, I mean, I've been invited to Hawaii and everything. I haven't gone there. I'm probably going to take them up on one of these days. Right, that's so cool. They treat me pretty well. So that's why I don't – well, one, I don't go because I'm getting ready to retire here one of these days. But in the meantime, we have a couple more searches to fill. And if we can fill them, maybe we'll stay in business for another year until I retire. So who knows? Awesome. Yeah. Good plan. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that's that. Yeah, if you can figure out, like, taking that, you know, job description that we have and using some AI things, it'd be interesting. So I know the candidates in my database pretty damn well. You'd be surprised. Mm-hmm. That makes sense. All right. All right. Well, thank you very much. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. All right. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
