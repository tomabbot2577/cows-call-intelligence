Okay, so I thought I went in there and did change my credit card. And then the email that the link that you guys sent me, can you hear me, by the way? Yeah, I can hear you. Okay, the email link that you all sent me, that Robin sent me, it goes to Inky. And in the previous email, you said, don't use Inky. And so I don't really know what she says, don't use Inky. And then she sent me a link that goes to Inky. Okay. And then there's a warning on that link, too. It says, do not use. It's like, I don't know what's wrong with the link. Okay. I don't have the correct link. Okay. Let me speak with Robin. Mainly, I was just following up with you to get some information. She's a little buried right now, so I was just kind of reaching out to get what the issue was. Let me reach out to her directly, and I'll get some clarification on that. And I can get her to send you the correct link to update that information.",
