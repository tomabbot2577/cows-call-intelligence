    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, my name is Danielle. I'm with Commercial Finance Consultants. We've been using y'all's products for quite a long time, and I'm seeing a new feature that I'm not exactly sure how to implement in the way that we used to implement it. I was wondering if you could help me out with that. Sure. So normally when we are sending out interviews, We link the candidate to the position in PCR, and then we go to, we used to go to a tab called Interviews, but over like the last month it turned into Pipeline. And so I would go there and it would show like a list of the different jobs that they were linked to, and from there I was always able to add an interview. However, now I just did it last night, and I called you guys, but the lines were busy and I had to, well, it was almost five, so I had to end up leaving. But I was not able to figure out how to add an actual interview. I see the link, like the job link to it, and it says link name in like a little square, and I don't know how to get that to turn into the interview format that we use. Okay. Let's jump on a quick screen share. It looks like your account was upgraded. It must have been through Chris Raines upgraded to the new pipeline. So, yeah, I can jump on a quick screen share with you just to kind of get you started. But I'll send you a video that's like a training on how to use the new pipeline, if that would be helpful. But at least we could take a look real quick now on a screen share. Yeah. So if you just want to go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. And let me know when it's asking you for a meeting ID. Okay, it is. Okay, that is 309-836-483. Okay, I'm hitting join right now. Perfect. All right, I see you popped in that meeting. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Okay. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. Perfect. That's loading. Yep, I can see that. All right. So if you just want to go back into PC Recruiter and, okay, yes. So you are on the pipeline tab for a name record. I see. Okay. So you can either open up the full pipeline in a new window, or you can stay on the screen and hit the little plus sign at the far right. Go to add step. And you can then use the drop down, the step drop down. It says reviewed right now and move them to any other step in the pipeline. Okay. I guess my question is like normally we use like this is the format that we use and I didn't – none of these like got me to that format. So even when I click on this, this is what I'm used to seeing and like this is how we navigate to the actual template and everything. Is this no longer going to be an option? Are we just having to use a new format Or is there a way that we can get to this, like what we're used to seeing? So it's been upgraded and replaced. So all positions that were under the old legacy pipeline will still have the interviews, but the new positions moving forward will all have the other steps under ed step. So Chris or whoever is the admin can change what steps are available in that set of steps. It's called a pipeline template. So if you have a different set of steps in your hiring process, you can adjust that. This one looks like the one that's kind of preloaded with the new pipeline, those set of steps there. But, yeah, let me send you – I'm going to send you a video on the new pipeline. It might do a better job of explaining how to use it, how to navigate it. Okay, but once I get here, I guess I just hit send interview, and then I do that? So, yeah, are you trying to send an email out to the – Yes, I'm going to send an email out. Okay. And is it going to actually go to another page, or am I going to have to do all of it from this little page? Yeah, so it will all be in this page here. So the – let me see. Introducing Jennifer. So the send to options on the right is the contact. Let me see. Contact. So that's going to be the person, the position contact. Or you can use the to field if you want to send it to, like, Jennifer. I didn't know if that was, like, it was aimed to go to Jennifer or to somebody else. Well, normally it would go to Jennifer and to Samar because one is the interviewee and one is the interviewer. Okay, yeah. So, yeah, if you just want to, let's see, add step, underwriter. normally it would have Jennifer listed under send to on the right for some reason. Well, it probably won't because the email that we have for her is not in the business email. It's the personal email, which is probably a good thing because we don't want to send it to her business since she's having an interview. Yeah. Okay. You could then just maybe type it into the to field, her, Jennifer's email address. Yeah, and then you could just check the box for some R. on the right to send to where it says send to contact. And then is this area down here, like we used to just fill automatically with like what we had selected. Is that not going to happen anymore? So well up top under where you selected phone interview as the step, you can put an appointment date and an appointment time. And that's what the form letter will grab from. So the current appointment date is 8-20 time 8-16. So as you set that, the email will go out with those filled in. Once it goes out, it doesn't sign it ahead of time? Right, exactly. Oh. So as the recipient reads it, it won't say interview.interview type. It'll actually fill in those fields with the actual information. And then you can, so I see that you have one in there that says interview.interviewer name. That can be selected above underneath where you check that box for the schedule. There's a drop down that says add interviewers so that it knows what interviewer to pull in there using that code. Gotcha. But yeah, all those codes do point to things up above at the top of this pop-up window, like the appointment date and time, and then the interviewers you could choose. So yeah, does Chris mention anything to the team about the new pipeline upgrade? Not really. I'm not really. I knew that we were upgrading to PCR, but he really hasn't said a lot about what upgrades are coming with that. Oh, okay. So I'm just kind of figuring them out as I go. I mean, I don't suppose there's any way to change it back to the way that it was, because this is much harder to work with, I guess. Yeah. It's much more cumbersome. It doesn't show a full screen. It's tiny. Is there no way to turn it back? Chris would have to kind of reach out to our team and we can explore those options. I haven't seen anybody really turn it back before, but I'm sure it's possible. If that's something that Chris requested, we could explore that option. but so is the is that bottom area where the form letter is built is there things that you need to change in there usually before sending it out I go in and I have to like add like the personal email right here I check all the links and everything and also I'm not a huge fan of it not actually showing what it's going to send before it sends it because I have to copy that and put that in other places. I mean. Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I would, I guess, reach out to Chris and see if he would, you know, want to contact our team about switching back possibly and see if you could go that route. But in the meantime, I will send you the video kind of walking through the different ways to use the new pipeline in case it makes some things a little bit easier in the meantime. That would be great. Awesome. Anything else I can help with today? I think that's it. Okay, awesome. All right, have a great rest of your day, and I'll send you an email soon. Thanks, you too. Bye. Bye.",
