    "text": " I can barely hear you. What's your name? My name's Garrett. Hi, Garrett. My name's Connie Rose, and I work for Alexander Raymond, part of Financial Insurance Recruiters, I mean Financial Recruiters International. And I'm with the company, and I'm on the Connective Services end, where you're concerned. And here's the problem. I called a little bit earlier. I am trying to call a creative roll-up in the PCR platform, and so I want to dial from that platform so it tracks it in PCR. That's what all of the recruiters have to do. And I'm new. This is my fourth week. So this is my first day actually calling on roll-ups, and I wasn't able to do that because I got a message when I clicked on the cell, you know, the phone that has the cell number. Oh, yeah. we don't call companies, right? So, I got a message that said I was unable to use I was not able to call out. So, I called in a little earlier today and they said that I did not have admin authority to use Ring with PCR. So, I went back to the owner, Kevin Saylor, and he said you should know better and you should be able to do that for me. And he wants to be brought in on a conference call if you can't can't get me hooked up where I can do my roll-ups. Gotcha. So let me log into the database here. You have two databases. One's called Connective Services. One's called FinTech. Do you know which one you're logged into? Connective Services. Perfect. Let me log in as the admin. And is your username Connie? Yes, it's Connie. I can give you my password if you need that. No, that's all right. Okay, so yeah, in the admin area of PCR, the system administrator has to configure RingCentral for your username. And based on the security settings you have, you aren't able to access the admin area. So only an admin is able to integrate RingCentral for your username. So what we're going to have to do right now, we're going to have to conference him in. Okay. Let me go over here. And I'm not good at this because I've never had, especially on software, I'm not that familiar with. You know, I think I've only been on Ring a couple of weeks. Let me go to messages. Okay. Kevin says, call myself on conference call, and he gives me the number if PCR has an issue. Could you call that? I'm not sure because I might cut you off how to bring in a phone call. I'll try to add it in on my end to this call. What's the phone number? 916-531-6699. All right. Yeah, let me try to add him in. One second. Thank you.",
