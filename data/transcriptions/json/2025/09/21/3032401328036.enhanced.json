    "text": " Thank you for calling me. This is technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Happy Tuesday, buddy. It's Mike with Meat Engineering. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm pretty good. I'm pretty good. Garrett, you're just the man I want to speak to, actually. So a couple weeks ago, they were supposed to upgrade our databases to Lucene. All right. Okay. Now, I haven't checked. I'm actually on the road right now, and I've just thought about it. I'm like, oh, shit, I should probably give him a call. Jim, we were in talks with Jim. He did a demo for us for PCRM, and I thought they were going to let us know when the database was updated. And it could already be updated. Like I said, I'm on the road right now, but I just thought I'd call to see if there's any of that across your desk or any of that. Yeah, let's take a look. Let's see. Where META Final Pass is one of the databases. Gotcha. Final Pass, Modern Staffing, Michigan Modern Staffing, Texas Modern Staffing. Okay. so it doesn't look like there's an update yet from the tech team of upgrading to Lucene I'll I'm going to put in a message it's been it's been a week now yeah since we mentioned that yeah and yeah let me uh yes sorry about that let me um I'm going to call actually call our tech team member directly after this and see what the holdup's been. So this was those four, okay, four databases listed. Perfect. And then the PCRM upgrade, was that something that you talked to Jim about where you were going to move forward with the upgrade? Well, I'm still, I'm waiting on one. So a couple of us sat in a demo. We're just waiting. Our president's been on vacation. we have to run it by him first so we're hoping later this week or at least early next week to get a chance to talk to him um but yeah we're just waiting for that chances are Garrett we're going to probably move forward with it all but I don't make the shot so I can't say for sure but it does look like it makes sense for us too okay cool that'll be great and um yeah so Jim is, I'm glad you said later this week or maybe early next week, Jim is on vacation for this week, so he'll be back on Monday, but then he can send over any contracts to sign or whatever to get that changed and updated starting on Monday. But in the meantime, I will get your current version of PCR. I'll make sure that gets upgraded to leucine ASAP. I don't know what the holdup's been on that. It's strange. It's been sitting there two weeks. It's crazy. So, yeah, I will get that kind of escalated to my supervisor. Would you be able to let us know, like email or whatever, just that once it is so that we can, I could let everybody know that they have some of those search features? Yeah, absolutely. As soon as that's updated, we'll make sure to tell you. So Lucene's been updated and the AI research trial has been extended to those databases. Awesome. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry again about the wait on that. But yeah, we'll be we'll be talking to the tech team today. OK. And no worries. And actually, I was just looking through some of my I have an email there. I stopped at a light here. I thought, did somebody get back? So the one thing that they said they had, they're waiting for the database to be updated so that they can justify how much time is actually saved with the AI tools prior to moving forward with PCRM. So actually, I don't know if she's listening to our conversation. She emailed us as we were talking here. I've been waiting actually for her to get back to me earlier in the week. But, yeah, so she says she doesn't have enough data yet to provide to the president with how much time savings is actually, you know, goes along with some of this AI stuff. So, yeah, if you could let me know about that, I will let them know once it's done and we'll move that way. Awesome. That sounds good. Yeah, expect something from us very soon with an update on all of that. Awesome. Thanks, Garrett. Thank you. Have a great day. You too, buddy. Take care. Bye. Bye.",
