    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. How are you doing? I am well. Kent, how are you? I'm good. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for joining me today. And I don't have my camera on. I'm upstairs in my very messy office because there's kids here today home from school, and it's a mess. So my background would be a disaster. So I'm going to keep my camera hidden if that's okay with you. Certainly. name. Yeah, so I wanted to give you a quick call, kind of introduce myself, talk with you a little bit about PC Recruiter. I understand you're a new dimensional search office, and are you part of their September class? I'm going to be October, actually. October, okay, and what date is that happening? I haven't run into that one yet. Sixth, October 6th. Perfect, perfect, okay. So what I was going to do today, answer any questions you might have about PC Recruiter. Have you seen it? Do you know it? Was there any initial questions you had about it out of the gate? I've seen several videos and a demonstration of it. Not really. I think I kind of get what's up. I've dealt with the CRM before for manufacturing purposes and for companies I've worked for. So I have an idea of what a CRM generally does and then obviously what's more specific to recruiting in this. So I don't think I have any necessarily technical questions related to it. Okay, perfect, perfect. Yeah, and they do a really good job of showing you everything and kind of what it does. And what they've also done, they've developed a training program that goes hand-in-hand with PC Recruiter. So you actually would have a couple to a few sessions with your trainer here at Main Sequence. Main Sequence is the company that designs and sells PC Recruiter. before your training in October. And then they would do some training, kind of piggybacking off of what our team covers with you. And then they would hand you back over to PC Recruiter. And it kind of goes back and forth, playing off of each other. So we would be more database-heavy usage setup. They would be more recruiting in general and stuff like that. So it really plays off quite well. And I would need today, to get everything kicked off, I would need to collect your company name and address. And then I can email you over the paperwork to review. That contains all the details of the system. It contains the pricing, obviously, $750 is the setup. That includes all the setup, a consultation to get that up and running, 10 hours training, all of that. And then are you just one user? Yes. Perfect. Okay, most people are. And then it's $50 per user per month. You can add or drop users any time you wish. So $800 is the initial payment to get it set up. Go ahead. So just FYI, I ran into a snag literally today, or actually yesterday. You mentioned my company name and everything like that. In some discussions that I've had with some people, I set up my company name thinking that, hey, I'm going to be good. I know my DBA, or I didn't at the time when I set it up to do my, it's called a ROB. So I was doing a rollover of my retirement account to fund this and stuff like that. so I just selected my name to be Kimmelberry Inc. Well after having some discussions they're like oh you should not have your name in the company name. I was like well I'm going to have a DBA. I'm going to be operating as hybrid search group and they're like yeah but just for liability purposes. So as of like the last couple hours I'm like in the process of like filing an amendment for that change is it are you fine with just having my DBA which is clear I've already checked it. It's going to be fine or do you need to know my actual corporate name? DBA is fine. I've done it with many people's DBAs or some people. I even had one gentleman in the last class that just licensed it in his name because he didn't yet even have a company name or a DBA yet, so he just did it in his name. So DBA is fine or just kind of either or. That is all fine. Okay, okay. Because, yeah, I'm also the other – at the same time, with this, I was going to go set up my this all kind of came up because I was going to go set up my business checking account. I started that yesterday. I needed more documents and then I contacted my coach with dimensional search mentioned a couple things and she was like, oh, you got to change your business name and whatever. So I said, okay. So that said, I don't even have the funding in my corporate checking account because I couldn't open it and stuff like that. Relatively, I would like to wait and pay out of that rather than continue to pay out of my pocket for these tools and everything like that. So I guess my real question that I have to you now is like, would it make sense to touch base again in two weeks or something when I may have that funding actually in hand, have all my corporate name, my ABA, everything actually set up and in hand, or should we go ahead and start with some of the preliminary stuff today? What makes most sense? Well, I would say, why don't we start with, at least send over the paperwork I'll get that to you today. So you'll have it, review it, take a look. then whenever you're ready sign it that'll come back to me I'll counter sign it and then I'll notice on the invoice at that point so the invoice didn't even sent till after you sign it so we could get today's step at least get everything sent he comes in an email like a DocuSign style agreement okay that's perfect sounds good to me yeah that way as soon as you're ready you can sign it that'll trigger it to me and then we'll get the invoice out at that point once everything's set up and ready to go so what is your your company name is street address. I can collect that now if that's okay. Yeah, I might. It might just be better to put it in the chat. How do you think about that? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I always forget about that, but that does make the most sense. That way you don't have to spell it out and shit. I mean, that's easy, but... Yeah, so we got that okay. So, hybrid search group and then street address. Pop that in there if you would. And I think I've got your email address because we've emailed there. Okay. And what is a good phone number for you? Just so I don't always get them, so I want to make sure I have one. It's right there. Excellent. Excellent. So what I'll do, I will later today put an email together and it will be the PC Recruiter paperwork. It'll come over like, it's called a Panda Doc, but it's just like DocuSign, just a different brand. That'll have all the details there. When you're ready, just DocuSign that. That'll come to me to get countersigned and then I will put in the request to have the invoice sent. So the invoice wouldn't even be sent until you sign it. So if you need to take a week or two, whatever, that's good. And I'll just keep an eye out. Maybe I'll check back if I haven't heard anything into to follow up. That works. Yeah. I'm imagining about, it looks from what I can tell, the Secretary of State website, if I'm in my name and all that stuff, it's going to be roughly, yeah, roughly two weeks to get all this stuff taken care of. So it could last a little bit longer. But since I'm not starting my class until October, that's probably why. I mean, like, there's so many different things, and I am currently employed, and I can just push out my date that I'm going to like to quit that a little bit longer. So it makes it a little bit more chill getting all set up here. Yeah, you've got some time, so that's good. I've had people that called me, like, the Friday before their class starts on Monday, and they're trying to get everything done, so it's good to be on your end of things. So you've got the time. I will go ahead and send that out. Anything you need in the meantime, any questions, give me a call, and then I'll touch base in two weeks if we don't connect by then. Great. Jim, thank you very much. All right. Thank you, Kent. I'll talk to you soon. Have a good one. Bye-bye. You too. Bye-bye.",
