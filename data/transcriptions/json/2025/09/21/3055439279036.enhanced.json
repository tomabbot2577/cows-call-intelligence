    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Hey, we used to use your service. We switched about two years ago to another platform, and we're looking at platforms again. And I wanted to just maybe do a demo with my team just to see it, maybe look at, compare Apple's Apple to what's changed in the last couple of years. It looks like you guys have added maybe some AI features and some other things. I'm just curious. Maybe we made the wrong choice to move, but would you guys be able to set something like that with us? Yeah, I'll transfer you over to our sales department. I tried to book a demo, and I think maybe because we were in the system before, it's not letting me do that. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, let me see if Jim Lombardo is available. He would be the account rep for any new accounts. Let me check to see if he's available. One second. Okay, that went right to Jim's voicemail. He's probably got a call right now. But I can – let me transfer you over to his voicemail, and I'll also leave a note on his desk to reach out to you, and then he would be able to give you that demo and show you all the new features and get you all up to date on that. Thank you. Let me transfer to his voicemail now, and feel free to call back and reach out if you need anything else. All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks.",
