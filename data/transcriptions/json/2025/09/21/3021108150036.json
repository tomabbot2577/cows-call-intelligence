    "text": " Thank you for calling me in Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Gina with J-Powers. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Hey, I need to pick your brain a little bit. I just need a number. I'm looking for, like, the number of placements we have done and recorded in PCR from the moment we opened our office, which is, I guess, 2012 is when we opened our business to date. How do I get that report? How do I do that report? So what you could do... I just need a number to find out how many placements have we done to date. Let me see if I can do it this way. Okay. Thank you. And you said 2012? Yes. Yes. Yes, I think that's when Jennifer opened the business. So, in PC Recruiter, when you place somebody, it writes a placement activity or that placed activity. So I did a name search. Okay. So go to the name, name icon. I'll go to activities up at the top. Oh, okay. Activities. Okay. Got it. And then in the start date, I just, under search params, I went back to 2012. and selected January 1st. So 1-1-2012, you could just even type it in there. Okay. And then in the bottom part where it says filters, where it says username, I blinked that out. Okay. And then where it says activity type, I just typed in placed. Oh. type in place place the P-L-A-C-E-D oh okay okay got it and then you'll just click that magnifying glass up at the top okay and then the results what I have is 206 yep okay okay so that's how you do it okay alright that's all I needed to know yep no problem thank you so much have a great weekend okay you too okay bye bye",
