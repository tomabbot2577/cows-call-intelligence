    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, how's it going? My name is Omar. I'm calling for a customer of ours who is having an issue with the PCR portal integration for Outlook. Okay. What's going on? So they seem to have an issue that whenever they are trying to do the selected message option. Okay. Okay. And the add-in, it opens up a new window that has nothing on it. It's just like a blank gray screen. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps of verifying that the connection is still there. I don't know. Can we do a screen share? Yeah, absolutely. I'm going to go ahead and invite you to a session. Is this a good number to text you on, or how can I send you this? You can send it to me by email if that's an option. Sure. Okay. It's Robin, R-O-B-I-N, at mainsequence.net. And who is the customer with the issue? Because I got it right. It's going to be Jeff Fries, F-R-I-E-S-S. Global Executive Solutions. Okay. Yes. And your name is Omar? Yes. Okay. Robin at main sequence. Yep. R O B I N at main sequence.net. Dot net. Okay. Awesome. Okay. Let's see. Do that invite. Got it. Okay. Okay. Screen sharing. Okay. Is it doing anything? Yes. Okay. Sorry about that. If we go over to... I'm not seeing anything on my side. Hold on one second. Should I download and run? Yes. Let's go to Opener. Where's go to Opener? Why am I not seeing that? It should be like on your downloads. I believe you can just run it. Oh, did it go up there? Okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it didn't do it. Okay, let me try it again. That's weird. Okay. Good. There it goes. Now it's going. I tried downloading it the first time. Sorry. Oh, okay. No worries. I appreciate your help. No problem. Oh, why does it want a password? What did I do? I don't want to... I don't want to, like, Crane of Cone, let's go to this opener. Okay. Darn it. Come on. Yeah, it's saying email address next or sign in with passkey. Sign in with passkey. How odd. I wonder if we had this before. Maybe it's looking for like one of my accounts that we no longer use. It doesn't typically require. Yeah. And that's kind of weird, isn't it? Yeah. Is there any other platform that I can at least do like a screen share with you? Yeah. Do you want to just do a Google meet? They're easy. Oh, sure. We can do that. Okay. All right. Let me just do one of those. Okay. Here. New meeting. Start an instant. and I'll just put your email address in here. Yeah. Okay. And others. Surprised to hear another voice. I usually get Garrett. Yeah, because I'm usually doing other stuff lately, it seems like. Okay. I also do billing and trainings. Okay. But I've been here, gosh, 19 years. Oh, wow. Yeah. Long time. It's just I'm sometimes involved in other stuff. Not always doing support lately, it seems. Just did my thing for 18 years at least, 18 and a half. Nice, nice. Okay, I see the invite. I'm enjoying it now. And then you don't need to do camera or the microphone since we're already on the phone. Sweet. Okay, asking to be let in. All right, so at the bottom of your screen, hit share, but go over to entire screen. I see screen share, entire screen. And then select screen to show, because I'm sure you probably have multiple monitors. Yes. I will go ahead and move that over to the right here one second. Sorry about that. There's screen three. Perfect. Okay. All righty? Okay. All right. So show me what's going. Okay, let's first do this. Let's go to options. Okay. Up at the very top. Yes, one second. I believe he's kind of... Oh. Okay. Overriding your mouse? Okay. Yes. I'm going to go ahead and shoot him a chat saying I need the controls for a second. Okay. Okay, it looks like he's stopped. All right. Options. Where do you see... It's within the PCR ribbon. almost halfway over it's got a green wrench icon you just went past it oh right right right let's make sure little small is that 530 how do I make it bigger last three digits that's what 530 looks like that's the very top on the title bar yes 530 hit test connection Okay. Okay. And then, okay, so go ahead and save and close the screen. Okay. Okay. I wonder if it's like the screen sizes. Let's go to file. File. Yep. And go to options at the bottom left. left yep okay this is probably it see where it says optimized for best appearance and optimized for compatibility it has to be optimized for compatibility otherwise a lot of display things are very off and then while we're here let's click add-ins over at the left do i need a okay i don't need to hit okay or anything no i think you only have to hit okay once at the end okay the other thing I would do so that it doesn't start getting like timed out like bogged down I think I look it's really lazy as far as loading add-ins see where it says come add-ins at the bottom whether it says go yes I would at least turn off social connector and one notes if he does not use those add-ins with an outlook which most people don't I can't even figure out what the social connector option even is but it seems to help if we turn those off okay so it was one note okay and social connector and if he doesn't use skype then turn that one off too okay he doesn't use skype within his outlook okay and then hit ok okay now let's go file exit okay now let's go back to his outlook it could have been that optimizer compatibility setting usually like when you try to do something in pcr like it opened like this weird toolbar almost even outside okay so let's maximize this window let's see what's going on okay this one just says say don't show me again and skip that rounded look banner okay okay now let's go to an email and hit select and message and then click it again it found a record let's click it again boom wow now first it wasn't yeah so and then the first time it kind of opened small like this if you maximize it while we're here uh-huh okay i'll go ahead and the next one yeah and then that way you can kind of see it and then close it again okay that's up here yes now try select and message again and it should open bigger I believe oh wow okay so amazing yes I think you can optimize the pit for compatible I usually when I'm setting up for some it's almost like the first thing I do then I install the added it was something that they didn't even have for a while and gosh it was a few years back and all of a sudden people think they're opening weird and somebody somehow that feature was added and somebody figured out it's that setting so wow i always change that first and then do the added okay well awesome thank you so much i appreciate your help there you are welcome have you have a nice day likewise bye-bye",
