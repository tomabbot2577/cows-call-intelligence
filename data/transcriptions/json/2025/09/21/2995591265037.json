    "text": " Hello? Hello, Sharon. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good, Jim. How are you? I am well. I saw that your PC Recruiter database was just set up, and I just wanted to touch base, confirm with you that you're ready for me to have the data transferred over from MRI Iowa City? I am. I'm not at my computer right now. Was I supposed to click or open anything with those emails you sent? Oh, no. No, nothing yet. That was just like Mackenzie set everything up. He created your database. It's there ready for me to have the data transferred over from MR Iowa City. It's probably better if you don't log into that database because what will happen is the actual MR Iowa City database is going to be copied over, and it's going to be a separate sign-in under your URL that you'll use from there. So nothing you need to worry about doing quite yet. I have the sign-off from Jeannie, so that's good. I'll go ahead and get the ticket in to get that transfer happening probably today, tomorrow. and then you should see another ticket from me from our ticketing system letting McKenzie know we have to move the data. Then you'll see a response when that's done. And then I'll also get your training ticket because I think we did a couple hours training if needed. Do you think you'll need any training or not? Yeah, there's a few things I don't know how to do. So like I said, I'm not on my computer right now, but I know I have PCR pulled up on it because I just left for about an hour and I didn't log out of everything. Is it okay that I'm logged in? Oh, yeah, won't hurt a thing because it won't happen in the next hour. I've got to get the ticket in and get the sign-off all together, and then he'll put it in his queue, and I think he normally does those end of the day. So nothing to worry about. It's not going to hurt anything. And they'll just move that database from MRI Iowa City over to you. Are you using it through MRI Iowa City right now? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Maybe I'll try and see, request that he do it, like, tonight so that it's not happening right while you're doing it because if you happen to be entering an activity as he made the backup to move it, that activity wouldn't move. So I would say add sparingly over the next day or two just in case, and I'll have him try and let us know when he's going to do it or maybe try to do it tonight, end of the day, or something like that. Okay, that sounds good. And I may have some questions like how I log into it then again with the new URL. So, yes, that would be great. I'll probably be calling you tomorrow then. Yes, let me know tomorrow. And it's going to be a new link. I think it might even be a different password because moving the data from one URL to another might necessitate a change in password, but he'll email. If it is the case, he'll email it to you. Yeah, because I don't even know if I have my old password where that would, if I've got it written down somewhere. It's been so many years since I've changed it. So if it's a new password, that would be even better. I think that's what it will do. But he'll let you know, and I will go ahead and get working on that. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thank you. Take care. Bye-bye.",
