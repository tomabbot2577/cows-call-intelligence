    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hello, Jim. Hello, David. How are you? I'm doing well. I am much better technologically today. It's actually working for me. So happy to show you around a little bit. So did you have any initial questions, areas of interest? I was going to give you kind of a general walkthrough just to show you the basics. But any initial questions up front? No initial questions. I suppose with the information we just gathered from dimensional search, we just want to know how that is uploaded. And then how do we leverage that information going forward for the recruiting process? Perfect. Yeah, let me show you kind of a quick tour of some of the basics in here. So what they will do is Dimensional Search will upload some data. I think you have data and they'll upload it into the database. So that data is going to populate your PC Recruiter. So the PC recruiter database is going to look a little bit like this. So it is not going to look identical to mine because like I said, they have some specific templates that they give you. They have some different information that they include in there and they might have some different screen views, but essentially it's going to be the same. So you're going to have, kind of your database here would have a primary navigation bar at the top. The middle area is going to be for searching, search results and lists, and the lower portion is going to be for the actual records. So you would be able to, once they load your data, you are going to have the ability to go within the system and you could go in and for example you could look at company data and you could type in a company name here or even if you just left it empty, you'd be able to hit search and you're going to have a list of company data. Perhaps companies you're going to be reaching out to market for, get positions with. So you're going to be able to look at all the different companies in here. And if you click on a specific company, it's going to show up in the bottom frame. So this will give you the ability to keep a running list at the top, looking at specific records down below. And you can redesign this screen. I don't know if they have a preferred design. They might give you the ability to add your own fields or make it in three columns like you see here or five or four or whatever and then okay connected to each company is going to be some names so those might be kind of the contact person at that company and then if and when you get a job a job that you're looking to fill positions can be connected to the job as well so once you're in there and you have a mature database you're going to be able to go through and look at a company like I have then delay industries here and I can scroll down and see I have a number of job openings there and maybe a number of contacts over there as well so I'm going to be able to see all my contacts and all my jobs now you're also going to have the ability to you're going to be able to pull in names candidates so if you have a group of candidates that you're bringing in those can be parsed in from a spreadsheet brought in from zoom info or hire easy there's even a little app here that you get where you can pull people in from LinkedIn career Builder, Facebook, Zoom Info, a bunch of different sites. So if I have to be looking at, if I'm looking at someone's LinkedIn, I can click a little add to PC Recruiter button. It'll create a record for them right inside of PC Recruiter. Then you're going to have the capacity to go ahead and do a search. You can hit this advanced up here and you can do a search. So if you went like sales and marketing, it could be anything you're looking at. I just don't have a lot of sales and marketing people in this database. But if you do that search, that's going to show me that I have All these people in my database, 1,500-some people in my database, have one or more of those words I searched for. And then that small column over there to the far left, that's showing you that the system found the words sales and or marketing in their resume, their notes, keyword tags, summary, profile, and attachments. So that person had the word many different times, many places. What's even cooler is if you click on any of that. So if you click on the R for resume, it's going to show that person's resume in the bottom frame. It's going to highlight every keyword. So it's going to help you to search your database to find the correct match for the positions you're looking to fill. And then what you can do is I can always go right under the person's name. That will let me get access to their record. If I want to email them, I've got their email address in here. I can just hit the little button at the end of that. I can send an email. You can preload an email signature in there. or you have their phone numbers if you wanted to call them. So you've got phone numbers, contact info, everything like that. And then you also can log an activity. So maybe I want to simply note here that I called and left voicemail. So I can put that in there. Maybe I even want to make it no contact made. It was a cold call. So I can go ahead and I can add that to my activities. I could even schedule a follow-up if I wanted and put them on my calendar to follow up with next Tuesday if I wish. So you're going to have essentially an activity journal. for every candidate as you're going through here. So you'll be able to see emails you've exchanged with them. Like if you had it here, you made a call. If you had sent them on an interview, anything you do, everything's going to be tracked here as one of the activities there. Okay. And then there's some mass handling. So if you wanted to select even maybe a whole page or the whole list, you could from here, you can send out a mass email. So if you wanted to go ahead and pick a letter you can send out an email campaign everybody gets that email and they just get a personalized blind carbon copy letter email this and then we also have tools that if you send an email campaign you can go over here into analytics and you can go into email campaigns and you can see a detailed report of every email campaign you sent and in those email campaigns you can look at here's the open rate so I can see 93% of emails I said this time were opened 74% of the people clicked something I can even look down here and see who clicked what how many times and what links so all that details right there hmm Wow so so it's going to give you a nice range of different things you can do you can track candidates positions companies you can mass communicate you can track how well those communications are doing there's reporting you can customize reporting in here and the nice part about the way dimensional search and PC Recruiter play off one another is like I said yesterday you have a couple of hours training with your trainer here they're going to go for the basic setup and use PC Recruiter so they'll help you to configure your screen set up your usernames a lot of that basic information and then you go to the dimensional search class and they will then go over a little bit more on recruiting how to recruit and different things the system can do for you and whatnot and then they'll come back a little more training on PC Recruiter a a little more training from dimensional search so you essentially have two entire companies supporting you which is a really nice really nice thing wow okay okay and then there's all positions phenomenal i want to also just show you real quick the positions you're going to have the capacity to put positions in here all your jobs that you're trying to fill so if i look at the radiological control tech there that's the record for my job i might have a description there and And then important about this, you have a pipeline. So the pipeline is going to show you everybody you're considering for this job. Maybe these are people that you linked from a search, or maybe they were people that applied online, because you can hook this into your website. So you can kind of collect online applicants there. And then you're able to put your different steps through here. So maybe I had a phone interview with Bernie Rose, drag and drop him over to phone interview. So a simple drag and drop is going to move a person through the process. And then you have a nice searchable, trackable, reportable event in the system here. So this is going to help you to track where things stand as you're moving people through your interview process and filling the job openings. Okay. Nice. Now, any questions? That's kind of the basics of what it is and how it works. Any questions on anything in here? No questions. I think it's a matter of being able to access the system and being able to navigate through it. I wouldn't say intuitive, but it definitely has a lot of features that would be beneficial. Yeah, yeah. And once you get trained up on it, you'll find certain areas you like better, certain features you'll really find useful. Maybe some you don't, but they'll get you trained up. And so will our team. So you'll have a lot of different training on the system, so some different things you can do. Okay. So what would happen to get you set up on a database? You would get a link very similar to this link. It actually, like if I open it here, your link would have your company name where my name appears. But it would be a specific link to your database, and then you would get an email with an admin username and password. So to get the process started, I would just need to collect your company name and address, and then I can email you the paperwork. And I don't think I have the company name and address. Let's see if I do. Oh, no, I don't think I do. So what would be company name and street address? And then I'll email you the paperwork and we'll talk about how many users and everything like that. The company name is called Arete, so A-R-E-T-E, Career Services. Okay. SO I'LL USE MY HOME ADDRESS FOR NOW. BUT WE DO HAVE A MAILING ADDRESS SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST TO PROTECT THE ASPECT OF OUR NAME AND OUR RESIDENCE. BUT I'LL GIVE YOU WHERE WE LIVE. WE HAVE 5117, LISBON, L-I-S-B-O-N, WAY, THAT'S IN DENVER, COLORADO, 80249. 80249, PERFECT. AND WHAT IS A GOOD PHONE NUMBER FOR YOU? Right now, it will be 720-244-2986. And if you haven't, I'm using PC. I use the product to kind of track everyone I'm talking to. So this is my database. So I've got that, and you are – you're $50 per user per month. So were you one user, two users, or how many users are you going to be to start? Well, to start, it's just going to be me. But ultimately, my wife in about a year will be added. Okay, that's what a lot of people do. They'll start one, and then a spouse or partner or somebody will be added. That'll be the first person they add. So that's very common. So $50 per user per month. $750 is the one-time setup. That covers the database creation, the 10-hours training, help setting it up and getting everything ready to go in there. so what will happen is I will email you the paperwork it'll come in a panda doc today the doc is just a different name brand of DocuSign technology once you sign that then my accounting team will send over the invoice for the setup and first month so 800 bucks is the all the upfront that we need and then as soon as that's paid okay within one to two days your link will be created in the email to you so you'll have your link your admin username and password that's going be what you'll share with the dimensional search team. They'll use that to import your data and start to pre-populate the database. And then training will start with our team shortly after. We get probably two to three sessions before your dimensional search training kicks in. Okay. Perfect. Okay. And yeah, what I'll do, like I said, I'll send that over. If you have any questions, don't let me know. I'll touch base maybe Monday, Tuesday, if I haven't heard anything or seen anything from you, just to check, make sure everything's all well. And I'll just keep an eye for the return of the paperwork to get everything going. Okay, Jim. That sounds like a plan. Okay. Thank you very much, Damon, for the call today, and we'll talk to you soon. Look forward to working with you. Same here. You take care. You as well. Bye-bye now. Great. Bye-bye.",
