    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is John with Delta Diversified. How are you? Good. How are you? Pretty good. I have a couple of users notifying me that name records are jumping around a little bit. Okay. Like when you click on a box, the fields are randomized sometimes. you click on it again and they're correct. So I don't know. This has happened in the past. Okay. I don't remember exactly what was done, but I think clear cache maybe. Yeah, that would be my first guess is maybe a clear cache would fix the issue. I can email you the instructions about how we clear cache and feel free to forward that to anyone on your team. So you're saying, so they'll open up a name record and the fields are going to be in the wrong order, right? Yeah, so I just opened one, and so my view is four columns, first name, last name. You know, those are the first two, but right now when I clicked on this name record, those two are the top. They're the first two in the far right column as opposed to being on the left, but then when I click it again, nope, that one didn't go back to normal. Yeah, now they're just stuck, all jumbled. Which database is this one in? And then that one finally went back. Delta Diversified Inc. Okay. And then what's your username? JC. Okay. Let me see if I can even recreate it maybe on my end, and then I could take like a little screen recording or let's see. Yeah, like I said, it's random. Interesting. Okay. Solution first and last name. Yeah, so see my first and last name are on the far left column? Mm-hmm. And, I mean, it seems to be fine right now, but, yeah, okay, so then I just clicked on, like, 10 different people, and now this one, the first and last name are all the way over on the right. Oh, wow, okay. I'm going to check to see if there's anything strange here. Um, where's Dennis? Yeah, those are all pretty normal fields you have there. Let me see, is there any custom JavaScript? No, okay. I've got candidate info or old. Those do not have custom JavaScript. Good. Okay. Okay. I will report this to the development team and see if any other customers are experiencing this and then we can kind of go from there. I'll just kind of work on recreating it a little bit. You said you were just jumping around on some of the name records, right? Yeah. If you just like if click on the name tab and then there's like the most recent ones along the top there. If you just click through them. Yep, I got it. That worked for me. Okay, here, let me. Perfect. I'm going to take a screenshot of some of this here. All right. Yeah, so let me open a ticket. I'll get back to you as soon as I hear from the tech team, and I can at least recreate it now and show them an instance of this happening. So this will be great. Thanks, Garrett. I appreciate it. Thanks. Have a good one. Yeah, you too. Bye. Bye.",
