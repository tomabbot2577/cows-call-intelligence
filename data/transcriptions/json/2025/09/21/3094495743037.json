    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Street for Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, I'm having technical difficulties. I got a link from my job to download you guys' app, and I got an invitation to activate, but my activation code, when you click on the blue link, doesn't go to the app at all. It doesn't do anything but try to copy it. So you would need whoever sent you the link? No, we did. And they did everything. She gave me this number to call y'all. She's already walked me through and it wasn't working. It didn't do anything. You can't even click on your link, on activate part. The link is fine. So that would have to be in their specific letter. Who sent you the email? Let me tell y'all. Because I just got off the phone with them and she gave me this number. So she said she don't know what to do. Near Term Houston is where it came from. And I just deleted the whole damn thing. Oh, my God. I can't believe this. Take it out of my spam. Oh, my gosh. I'm not going to be able to... I'm going to need this invitation again. Or you're going to... You'll probably need the invitation again. I'm taking a look in their database at the letter that they sent to you. I'm just trying to figure out which database they sent it from. Oh. What's your email address that they sent it to? Trina, T-R-I-N-A dot F-R-A-Z-I-E-R 77 at gmail.com. I mean I've installed that arm link three times and uninstalled it for them but I don't know what to do no more which I'm doing it again anyways just so we start over. And you're not opening the app before hitting activate, correct? Right. I'm going to the email to open it, correct. Perfect. Because that's what she told me. But that still didn't do it. It's like it's not that I'm trying to activate. in the email. It's like, once you just copy it, you know what I mean? Not that kind of access. Yeah, like it's trying to copy the text? Correct, yep. That's what it's trying to do. I'm trying to find you in one of their databases but I'm not seeing you I'm trying to find you in one of their databases but I'm not seeing you in here that's weird all my whole team is on it but me everybody got in but me What type of phone are you using? Like what email? iPhone 16 Pro. Okay. Yeah. And then you said the last part of your email was 77 at gmail.com, correct? Correct. Thank you. Hold up. Aura is F-R-A-Z-I-E-R. I'm sorry. It's already been a long day. Let me try looking up this way. I'm still... They sent me an invitation again, but I'm not touching it until you tell them. What position was this for? That might tell me a little easier, too. Okay, let me... Is AR a specialist rep? There we go. time to hear. Let me... Mm-hmm. I need this to clock in and clock out. I haven't even been able to use it to clock in today. I definitely need to get on this. Yeah, their letter looks good. Right. Are you talking about the letter that just was sent, the last one? Because I haven't touched it. The one at 352? Yeah, go ahead and try that one. So, okay, what did I do first? I already downloaded it and I didn't touch anything. Yep, so you just go in and hit the... Yep, but you just go in... So now I need to go to the email, which I'm doing now, and hit store. I'm going to activate. And nothing's happening. Again. I can't I'm touching it clicking on it and it should take me there and it's not doing anything but trying to copy it if you highlight over it does it give you a chance to like copy a URL or yeah I can copy the URL if need be do I need to copy that the URL I can do that yeah try doing that and put it in a browser and see if that in a browser completely a new one of my browsers I can let me do that now it kicked me to the Apple store and it says do I click on open because it's already there yes no don't click open not like if you click on the activate button itself does it give you any options other than copy no that's what I've been that's the only option it gives me is to copy Now, to copy that link that you said for the Apple Store part, it gave me that, but nope, I can't click on anything, nothing. Activate, I can copy that. That's about all, but I can't do nothing with it. I don't need to copy activate. That's all that happens for me. I'm taking a look here. I also have another one my colleagues tried on their iPhone Thank you. All right, and they said it worked on their iPhone and it's working on my Android. I'm going to have to put in a support ticket for this for near term to see exactly if maybe there's just something like phone specific that could be causing it. It could be what? phone specific that's causing it like a setting on your phone oh lord come on let me see what my settings is looking like what do I need to be looking at that's what I got to figure out I have to put in a support ticket because I don't have no settings that you know here can go to anything I don't know what it could be I can't even imagine it that's like I said that's what we got to try and figure out because my other colleague that uses an iPhone theirs is working completely fine for the activation I tried it on mine with an Android and it's working properly so it seems like it's something that's causing it something on my device yeah so we just gotta mess around with some settings and try and figure out what that is so we're gonna put in a ticket on behalf of near term so that way we can let them know as soon as we figure out and they can reach back out to you so I'll go ahead and put out that in that ticket I'll send them a message as well just let them know that we're investigating the issue okay okay so right now we're trying to figure out what settings is on my phone, basically, that could be preventing. Yeah, so we're going to take a look because, like I said, we have another user in the office that has the same phone as you. Yeah. We're going to mess around with some of their settings and see exactly. Now, will you all contact me back? Do I need to call you all back because we really need this working today? I don't know. There's no guarantee that it will be done today. I'm just going to let you know that right now. Because like I said, we have to investigate the issue, and we're almost at the end of our business hours for the day. So we're going to look into it and see what setting might cause it. Then I could reach back out to you if we do have a setting change. What's the phone number for you? 484-426-4576. Perfect. All right. So I'll continue to look into this and then if I find something, I'll give you a call and let you know. Thank you. Yep. Have a good one. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
