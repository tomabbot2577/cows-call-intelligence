    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Ray George. I don't know what happened. I can't log into my PCR. Okay. It's like a vacation. Okay. So let's see. Hold on one second. I don't think I've ever had that problem. Yeah, I don't know either. Let's see. Ray George. Yeah, management recruiter question. I've got some DBA names too, but I don't think that's relevant. Okay, I can get to your login page. Is that where you're having an issue? Yeah. Okay. Let me try to... You know, it sometimes happens. Have you... Are you kind of just starting for the day? uh yeah well i've been i've been i i i logged in a little bit later but i have not been in pcr today because sometimes what happens especially it seems like over the weekend or if you're out for you know good nice holiday sometimes what happens like if you don't restart your computer even like your router it might be trying to remember a previous session and kind of just like hung up. I'll do it. Can you try restarting your computer and see if that works? Otherwise, you might have to restart your router, maybe like if you're working from home. Because it's coming up for me just fine. Yeah, I'll do a reboot. In fact, I can call you back. I don't want to tie you up. Yeah. It looks like you're, oh. are you getting into the database are you getting to the login page but you can't log in because i'm getting a it's trying to log in as ray but it has an invalid username or password looks like one time you tried our george at something but the username is just ray right i think they're they're it gives me like three or four different choices Oh, do you have like your Google password remembering? Well, I haven't changed it. So. Like if you like kind of like saving without like replacing, you might have multiple usernames possibly being saved in your browser. Well, I use two different emails. I have a recruiting business, and then I have... So the PCR username is not an email address. It's just the name right. Right. Okay. That's what it should be. Yeah. Okay. I just rebooted. See if it comes up. Yeah, because I've seen you last logged in on June 30th and then several attempts today, but you have invalid username or password. Yeah. So the username is Ray. So it appears you're probably using the wrong password. I haven't changed that password for years. But do you have your browser storing maybe different logins? That maybe you're pulling the wrong one? Looks like it's going to... The login has failed due to invalid credentials. Right. So, I can see... Yeah, what I'm seeing here, what I'm seeing here is it saying invalid username or password. So, as long as you're just using Ray for the username, it sounds like you're not using the right password. Do you have your browser remembering it? Well, no. When I click, It gives me Ray. It's defaulted when I click on the icon. So we don't store passwords because of security. It would be your browser. Like if it's auto-populating whatever the password is, it's just whatever you have saved there. Because you only have one database. And the username is Ray. So it means you're using an incorrect password. So if you have it stored in your browser, it may be stored incorrectly in your browser. Like, do you have it stored more than once? Do you use Chrome, like a Google password manager? Yeah. Okay. I did. And I just checked it. I don't know. Are you using one that says like WW2, like PCRecruiter.net? Because there's also some other PCRecruiter sites, which might be like Help Desk or things like that. Like if you go to your Google Password Manager. Okay, wait a minute. So I click on the icon. It gives me the page I'm customarily seeing when I log in, and it gives me the default database and the username Ray and the password fields. Your browser is trying to autofill it. So if you open up a new tab in your browser and then Google, do a Google search for Google password manager. Oh, okay. And it might ask you to sign in. Actually, it might give you a list, but then it'll probably ask you to sign in once you do it. one that you're looking for, it'll say PCRecruiter.net. I believe that's how it's going to be. Actually, it might even say www.PCRecruiter.net. Because I was just looking at mine, and mine's like LML. Huh. I never saw that before. Do you see one like www.peacerecruiter.net? I did. What happened to it? DC Recruiter Login, Google Search. No, no, you can't. No, so you're going to do a Google search for Google Password Manager. and then when you get to that page let me know oops okay Google password manager okay yeah here it is okay that should list sites that you had your browser save a password for? And then if you scroll down, what options do you see that have anything to do with PC Recruiter? Do you see like www.pcrecruiter.net or? It's got gosouthportsearch.com. No, that would not be us. Let's see. You know what, PC Recruiter. Oh, it's PCRecruiter.net. Okay, click the arrow next to that. Is that the only one that you see, or is there like a – is that the only one you see? anything else related to PC Recruiter in that list is there a main sequence no it would be listed as PC Recruiter because that's part of the domain I've only got the one PC Recruiter and there's one arrow and then what does it show you there then it opens it says hi ray and it gives me okay so you're going to send in your google account Okay. The password worked, but it's not filling in. What's going on? Well, no, it's not supposed to. This is supposed to just show you passwords that you have saved for that site. So what do you, do you see more than one card? Like I have like learning management system. Like what do you see listed there? Well, I'm in my Google account, but, okay, it was just slow to fill in. Okay, so username Ray. It gives me my password. Ray with a lowercase ray. And then for PC Recruiter. And my password, lowercase, NOAA21. Okay. Okay, and is that the password that you're trying to type in? Yeah, it's already in the password for uppercase Ray. It's the same password. So I could try to – so it's given me the passwords that I've had forever. What did you say it was? NOAA 21? Yeah. Lowercase. I know it's not the most secure password. Yeah, that's not being accepted. And NOAH? Oh. Yeah, NOAH 21. 21. I don't see that being accepted. It's not accepting for you either? Mm-mm. Oh. I've got to get over now. And they're math, so I can't see. We can't see what a password is. You can only reset it. Okay. Can you do that? Well, so let me just try a couple, let me just check something here quickly. If we have you, if we do it for you, we have to have you sign something, and it has to be done by the contract signer, which is you, only because we want to make sure we're only providing authorized access. Or what we could do is it looks like another username, Nicholas, Well. Self-administrator, so is Suzanne. Neither one of them have been using the system. Wonderful. Actually, they should be deleted because, let's see, they should be deleted or disabled because if somebody tries to log in, And they can get – here's the thing. You're only paying for one user. And because you have not deleted or disabled these accounts, someone technically could go in as those usernames if they remember the credentials and access your database. Yeah, we're only – there's only one user, and that's me. Yeah, so we do not change your users for you. You'll need to go in and either delete or disable those. Well, once I get in, I'll do this. I can't. Should I try again? It's not going to make any difference. I mean, I don't know why. I'm going to see if there's something else. Maybe somebody else has gotten into the database. Hold on one second. Let's see. It keeps giving me the same message. Login has failed due to invalid credentials. Unless you updated the password in Collectory somehow in your browser, that the browser is sorting something wrong. I don't know. Let me see. Let me go to my. The only thing I could do is send you a password reset form for us to be able to change it for you. Do you want me to do that? Let me check my passwords on my phone. I don't think. Sorry. Would it say main sequence or would it? No, because your link is www.peacerecruiter.net and all that. It would probably have something to do with that then. I don't have that password saved on my phone. Yeah, it's only your browser that saves passwords. We don't do it for security. We make you type it in. It's just that you use a browser to save it. So what do I do here? So what I'm going to do is send you a document. Let's see, password reset form. Here we go. Hold on one second. How weird. I'll fill out some of the stuff for you. you. Are you going to send it to... You're going to email it to me? Yeah. Yeah. Which email address do you have? Whatever came up as a thing. Ray at Southport Search. It's sending right now. Can I tell which one it came up with your customer account? It's Go Southport Search. Yeah, raygoesouthporschearch.com. So you should have just got an email from William Kubitschek, one of the owners. Yep, okay. Okay, so you'll need to go into that document and sign it. It's like electronic signature. Okay, I just opened it. Okay, default database. Send new password. to should i try the same one or wait no you hit you this is you just got to sign it i'm not allowed to change anything until i get this authorized signature from you it should protect us to make sure we're not you know they would be everybody like one of these users that you think you've got they're like oh i don't know my password they're not allowed to call us and just have it reset we would only go to you and have you reset their password or we make you sign this form we're very strict about that sure okay I just put send send new password to and then I have to sign electrically electronically we just hold the mouse down and draw I think it's click I think you click in it gives you like little signature options okay okay so and I'm also making a ticket and I'm going to attach this form to the ticket because if anyone ever says hated you got a password like I have to prove it that I followed all the rules sign our full name so what I just yeah I didn't type in your name I use my middle initial my sign so that's what I did okay and then date could be today and then click finish yep kind of cool I have it up I can actually see as you're typing if I have it open that's kind of cool okay it is completed no my Google sent me a message continuous ray yes and then it says start now start now I'm not sure what you're doing now. The form is signed. I'm not sure what it's doing now. So now what I have to do is download this. Okay, good. And I attach it to the ticket. It's changing pages without me doing anything. Or are you doing that? Yeah, it's probably because I'm in there. Okay. So now that I'm in your database, what do you want your username? I'm sorry, your username is Ray. What do you want the password to be? Do you want it NOAH, all lowercase, 21, just as it is saved? Yes, we can do that. Okay, NOAH21, right? Correct. Okay. Lowercase, right? Yeah. Hmm. Okay, try logging into PC Recruiter now. Yep, I'm in. Okay. So the other thing that you'll want to do is you're going to want to go to System, Users, Manage Users. I wouldn't get rid of Admin, but like Chris, Nicholas, Suzanne, and Thomas Hansbeck, any usernames you're not using, you either want to delete them or you want to go in and disable them. Because otherwise people could be going into your database because you're only licensed for one user. Okay. Like what you could do is like anybody that you know that it is not returning, you could delete the username. If there's a chance they're returning, it's probably better to disable. That way, if they should ever come back, I'm just going to guess by last name, you're probably related to Suzanne. If Suzanne ever, if you ever want her to return as a user, you would let us know to change your billing, but then all you'd have to do is go in our account and re-enable it, which is especially important if somebody has sequences or analytics because that username, your backend ID really has to stay the same. So is there somebody like you know that's not returning? So do I do the, go to the gear tab, the systems tab? Yeah, you go to system and you'll see the first choice of users oh yeah yeah and then you'll manage users mm-hmm so keep admin that's like a backup way for us to get in to help you out like that's how I went in but let's say Christopher if Christopher Brooks click on Chris and if there's no chance that he's returning once you click on his username it opens up their record down below and there's a delete option okay actually he's my nephew he's my IP guy that's what okay so if you want to just disable access what you would do instead of hit and delete see over in the in the bottom you have the screen where it says security it's like a in a side navigation bar click that let's see do I have to click his name first? Yeah you got to click on his name first. Okay. Then you'll see information security preferences in that sidebar at the bottom left. Oh yeah uh-huh. You'll click on that security lock icon. Go all the way down to the bottom of the page under the heading that says security policy and there's a checkbox that says account is disabled when you click on that then you'll hit the save option so that way even if someone has the password they cannot log in okay scroll all the way to the bottom yes and then you'll see a heading that says security policy with six choices underneath it. So I'm going to click where it says account is disabled? Yeah. Yes. You want to check that box. Yeah. And then hit save. So anybody that should not be accessing your database, you're going to want to disable it. All right. Like letting us know about billing is completely, we do not add or delete or whatever. We don't change your username. You just have to let us know for billing adjustments. But it's actually up to you to go in and say, okay, this is somebody I'm deleting or I'm just going to disable it or, you know, things like that. But you'll want to at least go in and disable the account. That way, if somebody happens to have your database link saved and they remember their password, they could still get in your database and possibly do some damage there. Oops. I got one more, I think. I think everybody is now is disabled. Okay. you want to you want to check that Make sure you didn't do it for yourself. I assume you did not. Okay. And then necklace. Okay, just make sure you keep adding. This is just in case you accidentally changed something in yours. Okay. Yep, that's good. Okay, now, just one more thing before you go. I'm really using the PC Recruiter now more for my new business, my worldwide vascular business. So I want to send an email out through PCR using, so I'm just sending a PCR mail. There it is. Okay. Okay. So when I click that, then everything that goes up, it should say, my outbound email should be rgeorge at worldwidevascular.com, correct? It depends what you have for your email alias. Let me see. system email setup email it looks like you have two accounts your default one is the worldwide vascular and then your secondary alias is Ray at GoSouthportSearch okay so I'm about to send so you'll notice anytime you're sending an email there's a from option and you'll have two choices okay oh okay i'm good i guess like because you have your wwvo365 that's the r george at worldwide vascular.com that's your default one when you have set up first so by default it'll go that's the one that it will jump to and then there's the option anytime you're sending an email there's a from that's a drop down that can give you the option to switch to your other one yep okay okay all right Robin I think I'm good have a great week oh you do the same take care you too Okay, bye.",
