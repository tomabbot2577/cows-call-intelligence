    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, it's Charles at PeopleFind. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. There's an outstanding bill I would just like to pay, but I want to make sure you get it on the right credit card. Okay, let me see. Can we do it over the phone? I can give you the invoice number if it'll help you. Let's see here. It's under PeopleFind. Okay. Sorry, I don't save the accounting stuff too long. Did you want the invoice number or anything? I'm still pulling up the system. Oh, okay. Yeah. I do support some billing stuff, like the other things, but I didn't have it up. Or if you have a website connection where I can just put in the credit card number, that's good, too. Yeah, if you have the invoice that would have generated there, it should be a view and pay option. You should be able to do it right from there. I'm looking for it. I have it open, but it was late, so maybe that's why it's not there. actually I don't see that view and pay or how is it worded I don't see anything that I can I can hit oh maybe I didn't open it properly just a sec now I've opened it let's see it wouldn't be the attachment it would be like in the email body oh okay let me go back there Yeah, the attachment is just a copy of it because somebody complained they needed a copy. Okay, okay. Well, yeah, most people would for their accounting. Yeah, you get like a receipt and stuff, but they wanted it to be – like you can click and open it and do it that way, but they wanted it to be sent as an attachment to it. Okay, okay. Let me close this then and just look at the letter, the note. Okay. Payment overdue, it says. main sequence technology. It says invoice. Okay, then if I go further down, view and pay. It is right there in front of my face. So should I just click on it? Yep. Click on view and pay. And that's nice. Now it's going around and around. You know those Microsoft idiosyncrasies where it says loading and it just loads forever. You know what? I have a feeling, I wonder if they're running an update on this software. Because remember I said, I'm trying to get there. It's taken me a while to get there, too. Okay, but I now see pay by card, so I can click on that. Yeah, mine's running really slow. Let me put my card in. You're right, it is slow, and I think it's because they might be doing something. I don't normally have a problem. I just keep clicking on this view pay by card and nothing happens okay I would try oh it just did it just did it just did it's definitely really slow for at the moment and it's normally not like this I have a feeling that maybe they're running some updates at the moment okay I've got it I've got it so let me just see if I can execute it I can't put a state in because I'm in Ontario Okay, so what you'll want to do is Is there a country drop down at the end? Yes, it says Oh, I'll change that to Canada Yeah, make sure you do that first That's what happens Okay, Canada Okay, and let's see Now I just want a phone number Okay Oh, it's going to work right now. 3-3-0. Okay. And the card number, I can put that in. The card number ending in 2-3-1-1. I wonder if that's here. I don't see it here. So I'll have to put in this new card number. 4-5-3-8. 4-5-3-8. 1-9-4-9- 062523112311. Okay, so I'll check that. 45381949. 0625231. And the year is 11. Gee whiz, I can't find this here. 11. 28. Okay, whoops. 28. Okay, the CVC is... The problem is, as you get older, you can't read the cards. It's hard to read the inscription on the cards. Oh, I know. I just had a leave for an eye appointment yesterday because I broke my glasses. It was out of context. I was like, I can't see anything. No, that's okay. I'm lucky. It's going to work. I think process payment. And it goes, what is this? Okay, I'll save the card. Let's see if it's working. I know there's money on the card, so it should go through. It's annoying when you have eye problems. It's annoying when you have any problems. I know. So it just says processing. Okay. I think it's just let it kind of sit for a moment only because it's just really slow at the moment. And again, I don't know why, but it was definitely slow on my side. Okay. Okay. I can let it sit. And if it doesn't work in five minutes, then I'll close it. And I'll call back later today or tomorrow. I just want to get it paid. Yeah. Okay. Oh, wait a sec. Transaction has been processed successfully. the payment method could not be saved oh so i think i have to go somewhere and change the card that you have in uh on record i wonder if it lets me do that well i can't really do it right now because it's moving too slow yeah it's okay so what i can do i can send you a link to the customer portal this billing portal if you haven't signed up for it yet you'd have to create the account is just for billing only. It doesn't do... Oh, wait a minute. It's just going to go much faster now. Hold on. Let me go out. Let me go out of here. Let me go out of there. Let's see. Bill or Jeannie. Oh, man. Oh, shoot. I just logged out just trying to see. I'm in. I'm in. Okay. It's just taking forever. It never does that. Sometimes that happens. Love software, right? It's always the same. Okay. So let's see. People find. Oh, I might be getting a little bit faster now. Well, you should see that it's paid and that it's up to date. Well, one thing was fast, and then the next thing is now slower. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to go into your account. I can't get into it right now. It's just like not even open. I'll check it out though. So that's good. All right. I'm showing a zero balance. So that's good. But what I'll do is after it speeds back up, I'll send you a link to what's called the customer portal of this site. And then when you sign up for it, you can go in view, you pay your invoices. But over at the right, there's a vault area. And there you can specify, like you could add your payment methods. You can roll that card in auto pay. It doesn't let you delete a card until you have the auto pay off for it. So right now, it looks like your auto pay is on with a card ending in 2311. Is that correct? Well, that's a Canadian card. The one that I use today is my U.S. dollar credit card. Is that the 6602? I think so. Let me just check. Yes. No, 2311. Oh, so that's when you have, okay, so the 2311, that's what you have on for auto pay? Oh, that's a U.S. credit card. Okay, that's the right one. Okay, that's right. Okay, so it should, going forward, when you get your invoice, auto pay for it, according to what I see right now. But, yeah, I can see now your invoice is paid, and you do have auto pay. Oh, so I don't have to do anything. no you should be good I don't have to do any okay good very good alrighty should be good thank you you are welcome have a great day take care you too bye bye bye",
