    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Ann Subaric, and I haven't used PCR in a while, so I wasn't able to open a ticket, but I would like to, if you can help me, I'd like to set up a demo for the AI. I have the trial right now. yeah well we don't we're not really we have a link to instructions we're not really offering training on it unless there's kind of like interest and moving forward I believe you should hold on let me check this though let me see something on ya do do do do okay let me see something here So you don't have, okay, so for the trial, you would have like the email generator for like the form letters and summary. And like when you're composing an email and job description, those you would already have. So with those, for example, like in that editing toolbar, you're not going to have a new icon at the very end. Are you in your PCR database right now? I am. Okay. Which database do you use? I see you have four. You have client, config, new territories, and professional search network recruiters. I have no idea. Let's see. Where do you typically go into? Where would I find that? Usually when you go to your login page, there's a drop down and it probably defaults to whatever you last logged in as. Let me see, I can usually tell by what you've last logged in as. Okay, your username is Ann. So it looks like you go to the one like professional search. Okay, so you go to the one called professional search. Okay, so that's the one I'm in. that is the one I'm in. Okay let me just check something. You do have Lucene. Okay so I can enable, oh you already have you already have AI search enabled. Okay so basically for like generating an email or like a job description as an example Like if you go to position. Okay. And you're in that job description, you'll notice a new icon that you probably wouldn't have before called AI generator. I'm sorry, where am I finding that? So like if you're composing an email, making a form letter in the summary section or in the job description on that editing toolbar, it's going to be the last icon. It's kind of like purple and blue and it looks like a, what's six sides hexagon? Purple and blue? Yeah. So if you're in a job description area of a position record, it's right after add links. Okay. Let me see. Go back there. Okay. I'm trying to pull this up. Okay. go into a position you said, right? Yeah. So that's like one place. And then where, I still don't see it though. So in your job description area, you have the editing toolbar where you see like bold, detail-sized, underline. It's the last icon. Okay. I'm sorry. So I'm going to just go back. So I'm on a job, right? So I went and pulled up a job. Yes. And then I'm going to go look for that icon. So in the job description area. Okay, hold on, hold on. Okay, hold on. I should probably get someone on the phone who knows how to do this better. Yes. Yeah, let me have one of the girls call you back. Yeah, there is a – here, I'm going to send you this link again. It looks like Garrett sent it to you and he activated it. There's a link and it goes over the AI feature, so it is already enabled in your database. As long as you're in the database named Professional Search Network Recruiters, which is the one you are logged in as. So what you might want to do is read through that document because it'll show you like an example of like where to find that icon. Oh, okay. Yeah, there's a video in there too as well. Oh, there is? I don't know why I didn't see it. I just like, you know, what he sent me was like. Yeah, he kind of shortened it like AI features, but it was a link. I just sent you from the ticket the full link, so maybe it's a little bit more obvious. Yeah, because I was like, what? Yeah, so let me know, did you get that email? I mean, look. I just sent it a few seconds. It would come from support at main sequence. Okay, hold on. Hold on. Yeah, I got it. Okay. okay so I'll go there um because I was like that wasn't helping me at all what do you say yeah that it like the first one is like he had it shortened was like text but behind it it was really a hyperlink so maybe seeing the full link is um to be more helpful but there's a video and then there's like more specific instructions below okay perfect because I was looking for I'm like yeah perfect thank you so much you are welcome Have a great week. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
