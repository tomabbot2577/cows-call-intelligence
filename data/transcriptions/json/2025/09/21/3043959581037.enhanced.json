    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yes, I'm getting an email alias list error. And when I click on it and do the verification, like sign in with Google or Microsoft, it says it's good, but it still won't go. I just did a test connection and it said it was fine, but it won't send. I wonder if it's one particular record. What is your name? Kelly. Mikulski. M-I-K-U-L-S-K-I. Okay. I think I've talked to you before. Is it happening on one particular record when you're trying to email them? No. No. No, I did. Well, I did one and then I'm trying myself like as a test record. OK, as a test one, because I don't want to just send somebody a test email. So I'm doing it to myself now. And it gave me the error and I went in and verified. And when I when I hit test connection, it says, you know, verified email true status. OK, but when I go back to send it, it still won't send. Okay, because the reason I ask is sometimes you'll get that same error. It's just like a generic meaning that we just couldn't connect. Sometimes it's because like the email address that you're sending it to is not formatted right, like missing the at symbol or a dot. I'm going to pull that out. Okay, what is your, I have your database up. What is your PCR username? I don't need the password, just the username. I believe it's just Kelly. Okay. Okay. Let's see. It's automatically in there, so I don't even... Yeah, when you write an activity, does it write just Kelly? Yeah. Capitals. All capitals. Okay. Let me see what's going on here. Okay. It definitely got something there. Okay. So let's see what it could be. Email alias list. and it is a Gmail account? Oh. Yes. Okay. Well, now it's testing okay. So let me – that's what you said. Okay. Hold on one second. Unless there's – let me try something here. You guys have me and your dad basically. Yeah. If I go back, it says it tested okay, but if I go back and try and send the same email, it gives me the error again. Okay let me see what let me see if I can reproduce it. Test. Oh I wonder if it's the image. Okay. Don't you get out of anything? Requested insufficient authentication scopes. Okay and you did not just type your email you did the sign in with Google option right? Uh yes. Okay let me just see something in case that's something with your signature because I see you have an image sometimes that image came along and that could be it let's see I'm gonna try I have to try a few things I wasn't having an issue before I I went on vacation last week and I was fine prior to that and then I tried to send an email yesterday and that's when the problem came up and I just you know sent it through my email instead of through PCR and then I tried again today just doing a test one. Okay I'm also going to replace your logo there using the server image store that way let me try more time here test test send okay probably something requested insufficient authentication code it's something probably something in your Google account itself because these are sign in with Google that should be even had to change your email password or anything in Google right or any securities in your gmail account I did change the Google password okay okay can we do a screen share sure okay do you happen to have ring central or should I just send you a Google meet I do I don't think I have RingCentral. Okay. I will just send it through. Yes. Well, yes, we have RingCentral. Yes. But I don't think I've ever done a... Okay. So if you have the RingCentral app, if you can open that up. The one with the R or the one with the phone? The one with the R. And then at the left, you should see like phone, video, message, text. Yeah, I've got to sign in. I don't even know what my RingCentral passcode is. That's fine. I can just do Google Meet. That's fine. Okay. Sorry. Oh, no problem. I'm just going to my new meeting, start an incident. Okay, so I have to send this to you. Okay. All right, so you should be getting an email directly from me. and then you're going to click the link to get in and then when you do get into the meeting don't join with computer audio since we're on the phone otherwise sometimes you get a lot of weird noises Okay, did it. I can see myself. I'm not sure if he's trying to admit you yet. And you clicked the link in there? Mm-hmm. Hold on, let me do it again. It says join call? Yeah. Yep. I think they call it a call even though it's a meeting. Join now. Okay, perfect. And then, so what you can do is just mute the microphone down at the bottom. And you can turn off your video, too, because we're going to share screen. Okay, so let's see what might be going on. I'm going to bring your database to the other screen. Okay, so I'm going to have you do this. Click share screen down at the bottom of your meeting window. It's the rectangle with the arrow. Then you're going to go over to entire screen. mm-hmm and then click on the screen to show okay so we need to keep this meat tab open so let's go like any other tab and actually let's go over to let's just go to a new tab okay click in where it says K work up at the top right of your browser on your Google settings and then go to manage your Google account okay let's go to security okay okay password last changed January 24th okay I'll scroll down a little bit more see what else we got okay let's go down a little bit more okay let's scroll down a little bit more okay see where it says less secure app access that could be why click on that turn that to on and then hit the back arrow right next to where it says less secure app access. Okay. I'm going to wait like 30 seconds and I'm going to try it again. That is probably the cause. Yeah, let's see, possibly. Okay. All right. So, got me. I'm going to go and do a test. after changing app access settings. Just in case we do a few tests, I know which one's which. Let's try this sign-in as Google one more time. And it might be that if you're... Let's see. Okay. Did it continue? Scroll down. Hit continue. Do I hit test connection? Yeah, might as well. Yeah, that's what it gave me the last time before I called you. Okay. Yeah, that part seems okay. I'm just going to do it just in case. Let's have you exit the test screen. actually I want to have you go back and hit save on that so let's do it one more time do the assignment let's uh sign in with google make sure you're picking the right account okay let's just make sure that okay let me try again sometimes I take so google's also getting we're um we've gotten very strict as far as okay it's working so I might just have to take a moment go ahead and try um if you go to your name option you've got me or you could use yourself I put myself in recently viewed should be working now just type the word test or something I think it just took a moment for Google to recognize our setting. Yep. Changing that setting. Great. All right, you should be good. Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. You're welcome. Have a good day. Have a good day. All right. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye.",
