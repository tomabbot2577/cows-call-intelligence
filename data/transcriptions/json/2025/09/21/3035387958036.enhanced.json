    "text": " Thanks for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Sharon with Winona Search Group. How are you today? Good. How are you? I'm not too bad. I need a little help. If you can maybe walk me through something that I haven't done in PCR before. Yeah, what's going on? So we have a company called Near North Title, and we downloaded from ZoomInfo like 200-some people in there, and we put them all under the Illinois office. However, there is an Indiana office, and so there's 49 people on that Near North title group that are actually in Indiana. So we created another company for Indiana, and I want to move those 49 people from the Near North Illinois to the Near North Indiana. So what you can do is from the names tab of a company record, it'll show you all the names that are associated with that company. Okay. You can go through and select. The ones that want to move? Yep. And then you'll see in the options menu of that names tab, like if you go over to the three lines, it kind of looks like a cheeseburger. Yep. You can then add all those names to a roll-up list. Yep, did that. I got that far. I figured that much out. Okay, and then from the roll-up list, you can select all those names. and then in the roll-up list options, there's going to be a change company option. Okay. So I am on the roll-up list now. So I want to select all? Yep. Yeah, all the names that are getting moved, correct, that are on that roll-up? Yep. Yep. Yeah, so do select all. All results are checked. Okay. And then up at the top, you can change company. Yeah, so like there's the, like say you were exporting from the roll-up list, that same menu, there will be a change company option. Okay. All right, select the company using drop-down. Is that what I want to do? Yep. Yeah, you can either use the drop-down. you could just or click the pop out and search for a company so there's like that little pop out box next to it you'll just search the company name and it'll list them all for you okay so near north indiana i selected select company copy phone okay and then just hit change yep now what was the name of that company that you moved them to it's called near north title and it's in Indianapolis Let me just... Now, which database was this in again? The one that's called Title. Or Title Insurance. Yep. Okay. I just went and searched on that company, and they have 40 new names there now. Yep, perfect. Okay, that was easy. I didn't know if I was going to need to do global changes, and I was like, that's getting a little deep for me, so that's why I was asking for some help. But this is a much easier way to do that, I think. Yep, yeah, that's the easiest way to do it for, what do you call it? to do it in bulk is just through the roll-up list. Otherwise, having to go one by one is a pain in the butt. Yep, yeah. Doing it through a global change, would that have been a way to do it, or would that have been not really a way to do it? No, so because the company name, yes, you can add it as a field on a record, but because the company is its own record in itself, you can't do a global change on it. Like the only way to bulk change companies is through that roll-up list. The global change is if you're changing like field-level information on a record. Okay, okay, okay. All right, well, I'm glad I called because otherwise I'd have probably screwed something up. So I'm glad you can help me. I appreciate it. So I'm happy you called, too. It's a lot easier to walk you through it than try and fix it. Yes, exactly. All right. Thanks, Tyler. Not a problem. You have a great day. Thanks. You, too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
