    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, my name is Elizabeth Frias, and I'm with Professional Employment Services. The purpose of my call is I was sent a free trial for the AI, and I don't see it. So I just wanted to inquire about it. Oh, sure. Let me check here. So, yeah, all the customers now have the AI job summary or job description, AI candidate summary, and the AI email generator. The AI search requires some extra steps. Let me check to see. I don't see it. I don't see it anywhere. Is it, I don't know, an extra icon or something? Because I don't see anything different. Okay. Okay, logged into your database now. Oh, there it is. So you would be clicking on the quick search at the top right of PCR, and there'll be a toggle that says AI. Wait a minute, quick search. At the left side, did you say? Top right of PCR, so kind of next to your main menu. There's a search bar there. Oh, right here on the top. Yeah, and then you'll see a toggle to turn on AI. Let me see, where does it say? I don't have it. It just says, oh, on the top. Oh, my gosh, that's all I had to do. And then this gives me a little description of what I got to do. Exactly. It gives you some examples, too, that are helpful. But, yeah, it's just using common language and phrasing mostly. Put in, like, a sentence with a question mark, something like that. And where would I put that? In the search bar. Yeah, you would be. On the top where I was just right now. Yeah, exactly. versus being on a basic search or advanced search on your left-hand side. Exactly, yes. So the AI is only installed into that quick search bar. Okay, good to know. I'm going to write this down. Okay, quick search bar. Okay, I mean on the search bar at the top. Okay, and then what else does it – does this give me a little bit more information what I'm about to read or is there more to it that I can go look under training or something or tools? Yeah, this guide is probably your best starting place, but I can send you a link to a short video that gives an overview of all the AI tools in case you wanted to watch that as well. It's a short one. That would be perfect. Okay, yeah. Anything that would help. Let me email that to you. Absolutely. Is your best email address ef at professionalemployment.com? You got it. That's correct. Yes. All right. Awesome. I will send over that short video now. And if you do have questions that come up, just let us know. Okay. Sounds like a plan. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. No problem. Have a good one. Okay. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
