    "text": " Hello, this is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Yes, I'm Mackenzie. My name's Jamie with Management Recruiters of Davidson. How you doing? Hi, Jamie. I'm doing fine. How are you? I'm good, thanks. I'm calling because I'm trying to download the backup that you sent me. Okay. And I'm wondering if you can assist, because when I click on where it says the free version of WinRAR, I don't see anywhere to put a password in. Yeah, that's not the, that wouldn't be where you put the password in. So WinRAR is a program that you're going to have to download and install. So the WinRAR, like the link that brings you to like rarlab.com or whatever, that's a website. And you go to the download section of that website. And let me kind of catch up to that. RAR Lab. Okay, so I'm here on rarlab.com. And when I look to my left, there's a panel on the left side where there's different sections of the website you can go to. And there's downloads. You want to click downloads there. And then it's like the first link in all of the links that it shows you, WinRAR X64. Well, that is assuming you have like a recent, like a sort of recent computer. Do you have like a super old computer? Is it relatively new? It's not super old, so that should work. Okay. Yeah, you have like Windows 10. So it's not the one that says trial? Yeah, you have Windows 10, or are you on a Windows machine? Yes. Okay. So if you're using Windows 10, yeah, it's probably the first one, because you want the 64-bit version. So then you click on WinRAR x64. that's going to download something to your computer. So then you can, it should take not more than 10 seconds to download. You can then, you can go into the downloads folder where that file was downloaded to and you can run that. It's just a free program that will allow you to access your file. So first you have to install this program here by right-clicking. You could run it as an administrator and then you follow like the basic install prompts that you might see for any other program, right? You decide where it goes, and then you install it. And then after you have the WinRAR program, you can then open the files that I sent you. And when you try to open those files, make sure to use the WinRAR program. And when WinRAR tries to open them, then it will prompt you for the password. Okay. Well, I guess you'll go through this whole set of... Yeah, I'll walk you. Oh, I'll sit here with you while you do it. All right. I think it's... I clicked OK. I don't see anything happening, but maybe it's been behind the scenes. I don't know. If you've gone through the WinRAR installer, then you should be able to see when you go to your downloaded database file, you could probably right-click it, and then in your list of options in the right-click menu, you'll see new options that WinRAR is presenting. You can open it with WinRAR, and then it will prompt you for the password. Okay, so it's asking me to install it again. I just did that a second ago. So we'll see what happens. And then okay. And then done. Oh, it says WinRAR has been successfully installed to the folder, blah, blah, blah. That's good. So now where do I go? Okay, so now you just have a program that allows you to open the data return file that I sent you. So now you can go over to the file that you downloaded that I sent you. And you can try to right-click it and open it with and select WinRAR as the program you're trying to open it with. On the link? Or just download one? Well, that link, when you click it, will download a file to your computer. So you want to go to the actual file, like in the downloads folder. Okay. And try and, like, right-click that file and open it with WinRAR. Let's see. Open when done. Always open. Let's see what happens here. It says it's got, like, 20 minutes left. oh um it's uh it sounds like you didn't finish downloading the file uh yeah these files are quite large and sometimes it does take uh take some time so you might want to just kind of monitor that make sure it downloads completely uh and then try to open it yeah um i didn't realize you didn't finish downloading the file yet yeah that would be something i thought i had done that like when you first sent it to me like two weeks ago yeah i don't know where any of this is on the computer sure the default folder that if you download something it just goes to the downloads folder and you could access that downloads folder um if you go to are you are you using google chrome um i am right now yes okay cool in the top right corner there should be like a three dot menu and then you click i see it here it's got one of them installed on june 24th the mr davidson one dot rr oh okay yeah it looks like you already have the file then so try to open that file with the winrar program got it okay yeah you might want to cancel your the download that is currently downloading you don't need two of those well i mean maybe you want two of them if you want to back it up a couple times but um it sounds like you already do have it yeah okay so yeah the link is just like a download link you can download that file as many times as you need to and back it up in like as many places as you need to um but yeah it looks like on june 24th then you you must have downloaded it then um so yeah try to open that see what it should prompt you for a password when you try to access like a file within that but when when you're going into this like what's your goal Are you trying to view your data? No, I just want to make sure that everything, before the expiration within 30 days, I just want to make sure that I have it downloaded somewhere. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. Somewhere safe so that if it's ever needed, I can access it easily. Great, okay, great. That's awesome. Because I was going to say, if you wanted to actually see the data, you might need another tool called SQL Server Manager, and that's like a whole other bag of worms that we'd have to get into. Oh, no. The PCR is working just fine right now. Yeah. I don't want to deal with that. Okay. Yeah. No, just making sure that the file is like accessible and not corrupted. That's perfect. All right. Yeah. All right. Let me find my little password. I know I took a picture, a screenshot of it too. So here we go. Albums work. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Did I send you another download link for the docs? Like it's basically the same link, but it ends in the word docs. Yeah. try this too with the docs too because in the docs that'll have individual resume files you might want to make sure that you can access that and open at least one of the resumes too. And then that should be your verification that it's accessible and not corrupted and it works. Because sometimes they do actually get corrupted and just things go haywire and sometimes I'll have to do like a second data return just so it doesn't mess up the second time or whatever. That's happened in the past. So checking that it's not corrupted is actually a good idea. I do make sure the download file is or the link is downloadable, but it would take too long for me to check if every single file wasn't corrupted. I guess that's why we give you 30 days to download it to make sure. Okay. Okay, so after I put in the password, it just says it's extracting? Yeah, so if you want to extract the data, it'll prompt you for a password. So you must have triggered the extract. It sounds like the password worked, or else it wouldn't have executed that command to extract it. But yeah, I mean, the WinRAR program, you can do a whole lot of stuff in there. and you could probably extract whatever is in that file to whatever place on the... It probably put it just in the folder right next to it. It's probably in your downloads folder. Whatever it extracted is probably just right in your downloads folder, I would guess. I remember when I did this a few weeks ago, I gave up for a week because I got frustrated, but I was trying to download it onto my USB drive. and even though I double checked to make sure I had plenty of space, it kept telling me it wouldn't fit. Okay. Because I just wanted to have that because, you know, in case my computer dies or there's a flood or something, I want to make sure that I've got everything backed up on, you know, a separate device. Yeah, that makes sense. Well, without me actually putting eyes on the drive you're using and things, I wouldn't know how to troubleshoot that. I'd have to verify that it really did have enough space for the files you're trying to put onto it. How big was the flash drive? Oh, I don't remember. I'd have to go back and find it. Let's see here. Hold on. Something just popped up. It says, select an app to open this .back file. That is the, yeah, that's expected. The back file is you would need like a tool to read it. A back file is a database file, basically. So you would need a tool that can read a back file, which would be like SQL Server Manager. Oh, so that's just if I need to like access the backup to reinstall? Yeah, like if you wanted to, say, leave PC Recruiter and go over to another, like one of our competitors or something. And you wanted to take your data from PCR to like their program, their database or whatever, you'd hand that back file over to the like IT guys on their end. And they would like extract all the information from the back file into like their database configuration via what is called a conversion. So basically, this is nothing I need to open right now, right? No, like you probably couldn't even. I just want to make sure it's saved. That's my whole goal. Yeah. No PCR. PCR is your tool for seeing your data. Like the search and do the back file will just be a bunch of weird technical stuff that is hard to understand. So yeah, no, it's just, yeah, you're right. Yeah. It's just a file. It contains all the data in your database from the date that I ran that data return, obviously. And then yeah, if, if you ever go somewhere else, they'll know what to do with it. Or if you never need to access it, you might need to like SQL server manager to access it. And then you'd have to, you know, upload your database into there. And then you'd have to like learn how to use like the backend of a SQL database, which that's, you know, probably not in the, probably not in your future. You, you only need the file to be there and you just need to save the password in case you need it. That's basically. Right. So yeah. So I just found my little, I've got my drive and it's, I don't actually, I don't know if it's big enough. It's 16 gigabytes. 16 gigs? Okay. I'm sorry. What's the company that you're with? Management Recruiters of Davidson. Okay. Let me pull up how big the download file was for that one. Looking at the download history thing, it says the docs is 3.5. And then the... Where did the other one go? Oh. shouldn't that tell me show in folder oh that one's like a lot it's like all together they're like 10 gigabytes so I should be able to download it onto this stick that I got just for this purpose right if it's a 16 gigabyte memory stick I would think so. Do you have the memory stick plugged into your computer right now? No, not yet. I'm doing the docs download, and it says I've got like 20 minutes left. Okay. Well, when you do – Apparently, when I did the other one, the 1.rar, Yeah. It looks like for some reason I tried to do the docs.rar and it says it was deleted on June 24th. So I don't know what happened. But it's downloading now. But yeah, I just want to see if I can, just want to be able to make sure I can find it if I ever need it. So let's see. I know the ones that are in this downloaded, I have so many tabs open, I'm sorry, hold on. Like if I just, can I just move it to like, like drag it to my desktop? Yeah, yeah, if you want it to be on the desktop, you can just drag it over or copy and paste it there as well. Okay, because I feel like I tried to do that and I failed and that's when I got frustrated and gave up. You definitely want to make sure it's finished downloading before copying it and moving it around. Don't touch it until it's done downloading. Okay. That could definitely corrupt the file. So I can try to drag that one, huh? Say again? Sorry, I was talking. I'm sorry. The first one, the mrdavidson1.rar, now that one's completely downloaded. So can I do that one? Yeah, as long as it's done downloading, you can move it around. That's fine. It's just while downloading, if you move it, then it'll definitely corrupt the file because basically the computer's just pumping data into a location. And if you move that location, then it's just going to keep pumping that info, but it's going to keep missing because you moved it, right? So it's like, yeah, you want to keep, just let the downloads complete. And then once that's done, you can move it as you like. You can put it anywhere. You can create a new folder specifically for backups to put them in or whatever. And then your USB stick, when you plug it in, you should be able to see like the like in the Windows Explorer where on the right. Sorry, on the left, it'll have like desktop downloads, documents, pictures, videos, like all those like little like, you know, how you like surf through the folders of the computer. you should be able to right click on the C or the, the drive that you plug in and go to properties and see like exactly how many gigs of space it has. Okay. And you want to make sure it has at least 10 or maybe a. just in case you probably want a little bit more space. Yeah, because this thing is completely blank. I got it just for this event. All right. Sorry, I've got to step away for a second to reach my computer thing. Okay. Okay. All right. So that, I don't know if that plugged in. Let's see here. I wonder, okay, it looks like it's in drive D. And okay. This is so weird because it looks like I did it, but I remember it not working. Huh. And this is for... Oh, never mind. This is... Escape, escape, stop, undo. I don't know what I just did. I'm so sorry. I need to... I've got a couple of drives plugged in, so I'm getting confused about what's what. So I'm just going to eject. I'm sorry I'm taking up so much of your time. It's all right. I'm kind of juggling a bit. I'm hoping to wrap this up here soon. I'm trying to close a bunch of stuff so I can reopen. All right, now I'm going to delete my books. Alright, eject cruiser. Okay. Eject cruiser. Alright, can I do this here? It says there's still a few minutes left for the doc, so I'm not worried about that yet. Let's see. Going to – okay. I believe I'm in the new one, the USB – the new USB drive. It says it's empty, which it should be because, you know, I haven't put anything on it. And then let's see. under properties just to confirm it says, this is weird. So it's a 16 gigabyte thingamajig. And I clicked on properties and it says used space 32, free space 14.6. Okay, GB? Yeah. Oh, no, the 32 is KB. Right. Okay. Yeah. So, yeah, that is something that is known and it's just kind of how it is. It's like not anything you can do when you buy... Like, there's no way it's not going to say 16. Right. No, that's true. Like, for example, my one terabyte hard drive, the space only adds up to 930 gigabytes for some reason. I mean, this stuff's confusing enough for me. Why do I got to do this? yeah it's just i think because of hard drives like also require them to have like a software on them so that when you plug them in for the first time like the computer will know what to do like with this device that you've plugged in so there has to be like some space needs to be taken up by like things on the hard drive so it is it is a 16 gigabyte hard drive minus however much like the default you know stuff they put on it that makes sense takes up so it's just kind of yeah and also they might do that so that the drive has enough space to like run uh like in in memory there's like a a quirk that computers have where when they're like doing certain actions like moving files around for example or just certain functions of certain programs like require you them like it'll require the program to like kind of make like a table in like it'll like occupy some of the space while it moves things around basically it'll be like hey i need some space section off this little bit of the hard drive for me and i'm going to use it as like a platform like they'll move like file from like one place into that like temporary space and then like move it to the new space so it's like they need like memory kind of reserved for those like transactions where it'll like use that space so it's kind of like sectioned off so that's just something that will happen in all hard drives you ever use that there'll be slightly less than what you like what it shows uh yeah so it's so 14.6 or whatever that's that sounds correct uh but it looks like that drive should definitely have enough space to copy those over yeah so i just tried to drag it over again and it says the file mr. Davidson one dot RAR is too large for the destination file system and it's the fight says the art this whole mr. Davidson one file is five point six seven so I don't understand why it wouldn't fit. That's interesting. I guess I could ask some people maybe above me to see. Like, maybe there's some weird thing where... Yeah, this is where I quit last time. I was like, I hope it doesn't make sense. And I don't know. But... Because, you know, I mean, It's comforting knowing everything is saved on my computer, but my fear is my computer is going to die or lightning is going to hit it. You know what I mean? Yeah. And then everything that I've gone through to try to save it will be gone. All right. I can make a ticket for this because this is odd, and I would like to kind of research it maybe off the call with some people around here at the office. Okay. To see maybe, like, if the format. I think I got it until, like, the 20th or the 21st maybe or something until my 30 days is up. So we've got time. I just want to make sure I get it taken care of, you know. Yeah. As long as you have it on somewhere, you can always copy it again to a device. So at least, at the very least for now, make sure it's on your computer hard drive. and then we can like work on getting it to a smaller hard drive or multiple different hard drives as we figure it out i'm not outside of the office or something you know yeah i'm not sure if there's like a quirk where it requires you to have like double the amount of space needed i don't know or like maybe maybe the format we give it to you like the dot rar format is like a compressed format and it requires a little bit more space i don't know that's like this is a new this is a new thing i'm kind of like guessing grabbing at straws and seeing like if anything well hey i don't know anything so you're yeah no it's it's a weird industry to be in where like software and tech is kind of i don't know how you keep up man i really don't i don't know either who said I was keeping up well you're making it really good yeah cool awesome alright where did my notes go for this call Jamie management recruiters of Davidson alright let me pull you up and make a ticket for you awesome contacts search contacts and now okay the one that's smaller Okay, so the docs one just finished downloading, and it's like 3.5 gigabytes, and I went to go transfer it to the USB, and it's doing it. Okay. It's only 4% so far, but it looks like that's working. Okay, interesting. So the first one looks like it's my problem filed. Okay, just the back file was like too much for the little target? Yeah, it looks like it's doing the docs okay. Do you happen to know, like, what the brand of your hard drive is? Could you, like, tell me, like, which one you bought or maybe even point me to, like, an online listing of it just so I could get the specs of the hard drive we're trying to use? Because it might be just that the hard drive, I don't know. I don't know. I have to look into it, right? So more information the better. Yeah, this I got from, let's see. I got it from Vistaprint because I got our logo, like I had it custom made, so it would stand out from all of my other ones because I've got USB drives everywhere. Let me see. It's plugged into the machine, but let me see if it will tell me what it is. I don't know if I can see. Nope, I don't see anything. would it say if I clicked on the properties like what the brand was um do you have like a box that came in or I was just talking about well yeah no the box that came in is just it's just this little box from Vistaprint which is like they make custom like pens t-shirts stuff like that is it a Vistaprint branded USB stick it might just be okay it might see it's going to see if it's got like I don't know really if there's like a it has an article number and a PO number on it nah hold on let me get a I'm gonna go get a little flash drive and plug it into my PC and see if the properties tab tells me anything about it okay because yeah I'm looking at that and it just says file system tools hardware USB drive? AC511 NVME. I don't know. What is your name? Mine just says Glide. SanDisk Cruiser USB device. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay, so when it's plugged in, it should appear on the left like under Windows C it'll be like i don't know it'll have a name and then a like a lettered hard drive if you can click on it and go to properties in the properties window there's a hardware tab yeah and i i think it might show the name like mine's called a sandisk cruiser usb device and the sand yeah i have one of those too i think that's what i use for like my quickbooks for accounting um i think this one's name, the first one that's highlighted says BC511 NVME SKHYNIX I don't know. Okay. This seems like a generic... Okay. Alright. Well, it's just a mini USB stick, right? Like a tiny thumb drive? Yeah, it's definitely generic, I'm sure, because they just slap your logo on it and send it to you. Right. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, all right. If that's the issue, I have no problem getting a new, you know, US teacher. Well, I'm not sure. I'm not sure what it is. Don't do anything yet. At least, at least you have it on your computer, right? So we can deal with this over time. All right. Is your last name B-U-B-E-N-Z-E-R? Yes. Okay, cool. I was just making sure I'm right. Making this ticket under the right name. So cannot. Move data return file. I'm just making a ticket right now. To mini USB thumb drive. Why? All right. Moving her data return file. Should I just hop on your computer right now? I mean, we're already here. Do you have time? Yeah. I don't know if we can solve it, but at least I could take a look at it, maybe take a screenshot or something. Sure. Do you want to go to meet.google.com? All right. I should have did this a while ago, but I feel like if I'm just doing this anyway, I might as well. All right. Meet. What was it? Google.com. All right. All right. So do I click sign in? On meet.google.com, there should be a field in, like, the middle-ish of the screen that says insert code. Oh, join a meeting now, enter code? Yeah, enter a code or nickname, I think it says. Okay, what's the code? It's going to be 10 letters. So C-V-R-M-Z-P-H-D-I-V. Oh, man, letters are so hard. Do you want me to say this one? Let me see if I did it right. Oh, yeah. Oh, wait, no. never mind too soon make sure you enter the correct code i guess i did it wrong is it supposed to be all caps i don't i don't think that would matter it's lowercase on my end okay let's try again all right so uh c as in cat yeah v as in victor r as in R? What is the phonetic for R? I don't know. Hold on, I actually have a cheat sheet taped up here around my desk somewhere. I feel like it's so unique sounding that I just never use it. Oh, I think it fell. Oh, well. Okay. We'll just say rabbit. R for rabbit. Okay. What's next? Rabbit. Okay, so Cat, Victor, Rabbit. M for... I don't know. I'm terrible at this. Money. Z as in zebra. All right. There you go. P as in penny, which is another money. Paul. H as in H? What is this? What is this? A phonetic alphabet. I'm going to have to learn these. Okay. Where were we? H. D as in dog. Okay, D is the last thing I got. Yeah, D as in dog. I as in India. V as in Victor. All right, India and Victor are correct. So the last three are D, I, V? Yeah. All right, let me try again. Charlie, Victor, Romeo. Thank you. Oh, I think we're in. Mike Zulu Papa. P as in Papa. Wow, that's funny. Wow. H, Hotel. D as in Delta. I as in India. V as in Victor. Okay. So, yeah, after you enter the 10 letters, there it is. Yeah, let me in. You might want to mute and hide your camera. Yeah, I don't think I clicked on that. Okay, cool. And then at the bottom of the screen share, there should be, like, a share screen button. And when you click that, it opens up a window. In the window, make sure to choose, like, your entire screen. There's, like, three tabs. If you don't pick entire screen, I won't be able to see, like, things I need to see, like, the folder, browser, or whatever. uh so yeah so now you can hide this you can hide this uh window or whatever like minimize it and then we'll start troubleshooting so okay okay so this one finished you can you see this yeah okay cool so the doc one went in okay so here's the first one the mr davidson1.rar yeah and when i try to drag it in here this is the message i get okay give me a sec i'm gonna take a screenshot of that okay that's kind of weird actually you know what um leave can you leave that there but right click on the usb drive the e drive and go to properties i want to take a screenshot of both things open side by side saying like it should have room right um move that and then open this now you can see them both right right okay you want me to stay on general yeah right there and then can you click the file too large window so it comes to the front a little bit oh yeah okay cool i'm going to screenshot this and be like why is this happening and then somebody smarter than me will maybe be able to answer that because it's like this says it's six gigs and it says there's 11 gigs of space why doesn't it work right because yeah it's the only thing that's on it is the the docs file that i just put there okay well this is great this is a great screenshot uh this helps me greatly because I don't have to explain it in words. I could just be like, why doesn't this work? Just send it to somebody with no time. Yeah. I'm going to, I'm going to ask, basically, I'm going to ask the testers chat and if they can't figure it out, I'll ask the dev chat. I'm going to do this off the call though. I'm going to make a ticket for this and then just get back to you through the ticketing system if that's okay. No problem. Because yeah, I don't know how I would go about like, you've done everything I know how to do. I'd try it and then it would error. and then I'd say, okay. There's no more details that it can give you. It says fewer details. That's all we have. Well, I feel better that you can't do it either. Yeah. But you will get the answer, I'm confident. Yeah, we'll figure it out. They are trying to move over a 5.7 gigabyte file. to a USB stick that currently has... I guess I have to explain it in words anyway. 11 gigabytes of space. Why is it giving a message saying... File... too large. All right. Sweet. We'll see what they say. Yeah. I don't know how long that's going to take them to, someone's got to see it and think about it and respond. So. Okay. I'm going to enter this ticket into FreshDisk. I have Jamie under MR Davidson. The phone number that you're calling from is good to call you back on. 704-896-8890. Yep. That's what we have in there. And then the. And then my email should be in your system, too. It's J-E-B? Yep, at mrdavison.com. That's it. All right, well, then, yeah, you'll hear from me through this ticketing system, then. I appreciate your help and your time. Yeah, no problem. All right, cool. All right, well, talk to you soon through the ticketing system. Have a good rest of your day. Thank you, you too. You're welcome. All right, bye-bye. Bye, Jamie. Have a good day. You too. Later.",
