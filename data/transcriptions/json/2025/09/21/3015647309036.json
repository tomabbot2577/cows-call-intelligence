Are you a process of payment? Well, no, let me take that back. We did an ACH payment from your portal to our account, and it went through. I keep on getting sent invoices, though, that say that the balance wasn't received. I received the invoice yesterday morning, and I just want to be able to confirm that, you know, get this squared away because our bank does show that the funds have been released. Okay. That makes sense. Let me send you over to billing one second. Okay.",
