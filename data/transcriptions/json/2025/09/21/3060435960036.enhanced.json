They've got to send me an extender and no Internet for the last two days, and it's not going to be fixed until maybe tomorrow. Oh, my God. Yeah, so I'm trying to do the best with what I can, but I was able to get onto my iPad and get, I had two bars. So, you know, I'm kind of doing that thing, but I realized recently that I think you guys have an old, old mailing address for me and it may have been from, so I wanted to like update you as far as like my business address. Okay. I see Brian Kane updated. Like we had, we also use PCR for like tracking our clients, has a North Orange Avenue address, but that's different than what's in Billings. Should it be the North Orange? Okay. Well, no, no. What do you have for Billings? The Billings says Summerport Village. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No. Yeah, not even there anymore. Okay, so is it the North Orange? No. You know what? Do you ever email? Do you ever send anything in the mail? Not really, but we do need to kind of know where people are. especially with uh okay just for like tax purposes sure okay so um what is the address for the tax purposes it will be the 100 north orange you know all right i mean we don't really mail anything there's kind of no yeah that's okay so forward the email yeah it's a pl box that i have my business address set up here the corporation's all set up through that address through state of Florida. So that's the most consistent. I just relocated. And, you know, for like the phone system, they always ask, where, where are you located for the phone? You know? So then I have to give my home address, but that is the billing address. You'll be able to reach me. They mail me all my mail. Okay. So we'll use the North Orange Avenue. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
