I'm going to edit and I'm going to take you... Well, it depends wherever you... Okay, let me see. I'm going to add you back into the... Oh, shoot. I'm already in it. Oops. Okay, I'm going to add you back into the invite so it resends it to you. I forgot how to resend these. okay should have just re-sent it to you okay just one moment I can't. I can't see it. I don't know what the hell is going on. I was, I mean, I've been enjoying the meeting since 202. Still there? Yeah, I'm in here. Yeah, like I said, let me call you back. I don't know what's going on. I'm not seeing anything. Did you get the invite I just sent? Maybe you were in like an old one. Okay. What's that? I said maybe you were in like an old one. It was new at the time. I clicked on that and I never did see you and I tried clicking it a few more times and never did see you with what was in. So it wasn't like a meeting invite from another day, right? Because they do change the meeting day. No, no. It was the current invite, well, before this conversation you and I are having. Okay. the thing just spawns and it's been spinning for 30 minutes that's so weird what if you close your browser and I'm going to bump the time back maybe that will help to kind of resend it save edited to 2.30 to resend if this gets it to you this time let me see here Let me know if you get an email now. I don't know. Bear with me because I'm logging everything off and back on again to see what's going on. Okay. I see your updated invitation. I'm going to click on it. So that one did get you? I'm sorry? That one did get you? I just saw your invitation. I'm clicking on it. I'm asking to join the meeting. All right. Well, that one's letting you in. Yes, it is. All right. Admit. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened there. Yeah, that's weird. Oh, okay. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to hang up on the phone call, because if we stay on both, as you hear it echoes. I'm going to hang up the phone call, and we'll just do the meeting audio. Yep. Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay.",
