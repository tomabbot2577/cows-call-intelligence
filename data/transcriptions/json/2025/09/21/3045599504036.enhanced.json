    "text": " This is Nicole. Hello, Nicole. It's Jim Lombardo calling with PC Recruiter. How are you? I am well. How are you? I'm pretty well. I had your email or a ticket from you while I was out of the office last week. Said you had some questions about your PC Recruiter contract. Yes. Give me one second to get into my office. I'm sorry. We've had a death in the family, so I'm kind of scattered working today. trying to get my head around where I'm at all right thanks for your patience I'm now back upstairs so yeah I am just working through streamlining some of our our different contracts and we're trying to figure out. Are you our account manager? I think it's Brian Kane, but I can answer any questions you have. Well, because I have emails now from like four people. I have, well, I'm sorry, what is your first name? My name is Jim. You're Jim, but I have emails from Robin. I have emails from Brian. So who's actually? Brian is the primary contact. Brian is kind of the main point of contact. I just got sent over. I'm the sales lead here, so I kind of got sent this while I was out of the office last week just because they wanted me to reach out. Robin's in accounting. She does a little training too. Okay. All right. So here's where our situation is. I don't know if you were looped in on the emails that a previous company was Midland Consultants and the one that was birthed after that, it was a DBA underneath their umbrella. and that's who the contract's name is in. The owner of that company died and so those companies no longer exist and the contract is in the old company's name. We are a new company, but Brian told me the other day that if we change the contract into the new company name, then it will start all over for a year and I won't do that. We have one person that's using this system, if that. So I am paying a significant amount of money for nobody to use this on some software. Okay. Yeah, I haven't heard anything about it. It looks like there is a new contract under Marvell Consultants. That's not our company. No, Marvell Consultants ceased operations. And actually, I'd have to look at what the timeline was. so I'm not sure if because Brian reached out to me and said that we can go ahead and put the contract into the new name but what I asked him was will this extend the contract and he said yes and so I had not responded to him because I needed to talk to the owner of the company and she does not want we'll let it ride in the old name but we're not going to do any changes that are going to extend the contract for just because we don't we're brand new we're barely open six months and We just don't have the cash flow to keep paying the amount of money we do for our system. Nobody uses it. Sure. Okay. Well, let me talk to Brian. That probably would be a little bit more down Brian's line of things. I don't know how I got that in. I just kind of got the voicemail came in a general and sent it over to me. I haven't talked to Brian since he sent me, since we talked two days ago, only because I'm rewriting all of our contracts for all of our team. and all of our vendors. We're trying to just make sure that we're in compliance. So, I mean, if it's not your wheelhouse, don't worry about jumping in. I'll deal with Brian if he's my salesperson. I appreciate you hopping in, but I don't think you're needed. Yeah, why bother wasting the time getting me all caught up when he already knows what's going on? Well, right, exactly. It's like, you know, kind of the same thing with the CEO of our company. I'm like, I looper in when I have to, but otherwise, you know, stay out of the weeds, right? For sure, absolutely. Yeah, I will leave you to it with him. Yeah, reach out to him if you don't hear back when you need to. I hope so. No problem. Wonderful. Thanks so much. I appreciate you. Thanks. Sure. Bye. Thank you. Bye now.",
