    "text": "Thank you for calling Danny Moo. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hi, Danny. It's Robin again. Hey, Robin. I figured it out. I figured out what the problem is. Oh, did you? Nice. You're not going to like my answer probably, but I can tell you why. Okay. Okay. You have a bigger database. Your companies probably have a ton of activities. Are you in a sim right now? Am I what? Are you logged in as him right now? No, but I can see his roll up. Okay, because I'd have to change it for you. So with his username, part of your configuration is to show the last activity date, which is fine because when you change an activity, rewrite it into a field. However, his configuration at least also includes activity type. so with that one because it's not actually stored in a field what it has to do is it has to run through all of the company activities find which one has the most recent date and then identify what's the activity type of that activity and that's a flowing account wow Yeah, that's going to cause a long. So by removing, by keeping a last activity date, first I removed both of them from his layout temporarily. I'm like, I just want to see, like, because it finally opened. I'm like, okay, that usually tells me something about pulling data. So I'm like, okay, well, there's last activity and there was last. I took both of those off for a moment and it loaded up just fine. I'm like, well, it's probably activity type once I thought of it. so by taking last activity off where you don't see the type you just see the date of it now it opens immediately so that's why some of your small lists are going okay slower but when you have a bigger list for a lot of companies that have a lot of activities that's what's blowing it down. Okay. How do I change that? Can I change that for per user? I have it changed for him. Now what you could do, what do you typically put in your layout? Just stage, quick comments, company name, industry specialty, city, state, phone, username, and last activity. Yeah. Okay. As an administrator, here's what you can do. Cause you can always recustomize it if you want. If you go to system, Mm-hmm. Go to Users and go to Copy User Settings. And don't do anything else until I tell you what to do. Okay. For Username, select LKA. For the source username in that dropdown? Yeah, I'm looking. Okay. LKA. I see it. Is he there? Is it listed? No. Oh, it's not listed. He's not a source username. You don't see him in a drop-down at all? No, not under copy users. Okay, close out of that window for a moment, and then go back to manage users, which is right before that option. And then put him as a... Yeah, make him a model user. What model user does is controls who appears in that drop-down. Oh, okay. most people will just send everybody the yes because they don't have a lot of people yeah where are the preferences maybe Okay, so let, so model user is going to be under. Oh, there it is. Yep, I got it. It's right next to the username field. We're in that information section. Right above password. Yep, got it. Okay, change that and save. Let me know you've done that. Okay, did that. Okay. Users copy. So what I'll do for now is just walk you through how to change it to you, and then you can figure out what you want to actually copy to others. If you, once you do that, back under system users, go to copy user settings. You should now see LKA in that dropdown. Right. And then for these sections, like these headings, the only thing that we're going to select. Oh, shoot. I wonder if there's anything else. though. You know what's better to do? Because I wonder if you guys all have the same for, actually before I do this, hold on, for name roll-up, stage, first name, last name, title, company name, city, state, email address, work phone, home phone. Is that what everybody would typically have as well? I think so yeah okay we'll definitely just do this for you until you decide like there was something else I really want people to have that we're not overriding everybody okay so under he's the source username and then under the heading called roll-up list we only want roll-up list layout. Okay. Okay. And then over at the right where it says, um, like all the usernames only pick your own. Okay. Then hit save. And then save. So this won't do anything with stages or anything. We just did the layout. Okay. So now when you log in as your own username, like what columns appear, the number of rows per page, that's going to be the same for everybody or that he had for you for any list so now when you go and you open a roll up it's going to be super fast because that last column called activity type is an inner holy cow yep so what happens happens like if you click on the first company in a list what that last activity has to do is for the entire company activity table it has to find all activities that have that company id number then it has to basically sort them by whatever is the most last most recent date to then find what the activity type is to load in that column oh wow okay yeah you don't need that call okay okay all right well that's the cause so um yeah like last activity like if you notice if you look at a company record there's actually a field that we populate every time you write an activity with a date we don't do that for the type just the date so that's why last activity as far as the date was fine but the activity type is not. Okay. On bigger databases. Okay. Mine, I didn't even notice it, but. All right. So, yeah, if there's, if it runs slow like that, that's the first thing you look at is like last activity code. Yeah. Basically. If anybody else is like using company roll-ups, you know, have them open up a smaller roll-up, even if they put one record on it, probably. Okay. That way, that won't take too long. Then go into their, if they open up a roll-up, because it is per user, if they go to configure, once the roll-up list is open. Right. They'll see layout. Just click where it says predefined activity type, click directly on that and then remove it, save, and then all the roll-ups open sign. And that way you don't have to worry about copying over to everybody because I don't want to be replacing maybe like any, like, because if they had name roll-ups or position roll-ups, those same changes would copy over like whatever column the original user has. So just making a roll-up of one company is a temporary workaround. Okay. If anyone else is having issues, which they probably are. It's probably across your database. Yeah, probably. All right. It will only affect anybody that has that activity type in there. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome. Thank you. All right. Bye, Robin. Bye.",

00:00:23,167\nHello?\n\n4\n00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:24,610\nHi, Danny.\n\n5\n00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:25,820\nIt's Robin again.\n\n6\n00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,591\nHey, Robin.\n\n7\n00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,279\nI figured it out.\n\n8\n00:00:27,602 --> 00:00:28,900\nI figured out what the problem is.\n\n9\n00:00:29,004 --> 00:00:29,380\nOh, did you?\n\n10\n00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:29,980\nNice.\n\n11\n00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,132\nYou're not going to like my answer probably, but I can tell you why.\n\n12\n00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:35,707\nOkay.\n\n13\n00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:36,473\nOkay.\n\n14\n00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:38,080\nYou have a bigger database.\n\n15\n00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,010\nYour companies probably have a ton of activities.\n\n16\n00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:43,128\nAre you in a sim right now?\n\n17\n00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,708\nAm I what?\n\n18\n00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:48,309\nAre you logged in as him right now?\n\n19\n00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:51,594\nNo, but I can see his roll up.\n\n20\n00:00:53,502 --> 00:00:55,058\nOkay, because I'd have to change it for you.\n\n21\n00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,182\nSo with his username,\n\n22\n00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:58,345\npart of your configuration is to show the last activity date,\n\n23\n00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,208\nwhich is fine because when you change an activity,\n\n24\n00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,110\nrewrite it into a field.\n\n25\n00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:11,752\nHowever, his configuration at least also includes activity type.\n\n26\n00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,423\nso with that one because it's not actually stored in a field what it has to do is\n\n27\n00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:21,846\nit has to run through all of the company activities find which one has the most\n\n28\n00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:26,750\nrecent date and then identify what's the activity type of that activity and that's\n\n29\n00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,771\na flowing account wow Yeah,\n\n30\n00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:29,953\nthat's going to cause a long.\n\n31\n00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,566\nSo by removing,\n\n32\n00:01:41,586 --> 00:01:43,652\nby keeping a last activity date,\n\n33\n00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:46,320\nfirst I removed both of them from his layout temporarily.\n\n34\n00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,820\nI'm like, I just want to see, like, because it finally opened.\n\n35\n00:01:49,341 --> 00:01:52,219\nI'm like, okay, that usually tells me something about pulling data.\n\n36\n00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,056\nSo I'm like, okay, well, there's last activity and there was last.\n\n37\n00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,180\nI took both of those off for a moment and it loaded up just fine.\n\n38\n00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,360\nI'm like, well, it's probably activity type once I thought of it.\n\n39\n00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:14,150\nso by taking last activity off where you don't see the type you just see the date\n\n40\n00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,633\nof it now it opens immediately so that's why some of your small lists are going\n\n41\n00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:21,937\nokay slower but when you have a bigger list for a lot of companies that have a lot\n\n42\n00:02:21,977 --> 00:02:24,459\nof activities that's what's blowing it down.\n\n43\n00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:26,615\nOkay.\n\n44\n00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,772\nHow do I change that?\n\n45\n00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,016\nCan I change that for per user?\n\n46\n00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,088\nI have it changed for him.\n\n47\n00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:37,533\nNow what you could do, what do you typically put in your layout?\n\n48\n00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,761\nJust stage,\n\n49\n00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,966\nquick comments,\n\n50\n00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:41,307\ncompany name,\n\n51\n00:02:41,347 --> 00:02:43,776\nindustry specialty,\n\n52\n00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:43,877\ncity,\n\n53\n00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:43,997\nstate,\n\n54\n00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:44,138\nphone,\n\n55\n00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:44,318\nusername,\n\n56\n00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:44,700\nand last activity.\n\n57\n00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,549\nYeah.\n\n58\n00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:46,500\nOkay.\n\n59\n00:02:47,022 --> 00:02:48,977\nAs an administrator, here's what you can do.\n\n60\n00:02:49,863 --> 00:02:51,860\nCause you can always recustomize it if you want.\n\n61\n00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,594\nIf you go to system, Mm-hmm.\n\n62\n00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,947\nGo to Users and go to Copy User Settings.\n\n63\n00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,400\nAnd don't do anything else until I tell you what to do.\n\n64\n00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,469\nOkay.\n\n65\n00:03:06,481 --> 00:03:09,897\nFor Username, select LKA.\n\n66\n00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,788\nFor the source username in that dropdown?\n\n67\n00:03:16,022 --> 00:03:16,693\nYeah, I'm looking.\n\n68\n00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:17,313\nOkay.\n\n69\n00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:17,868\nLKA.\n\n70\n00:03:18,800

00:03:26,215\nOh, it's not listed.\n\n75\n00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,040\nHe's not a source username.\n\n76\n00:03:28",
