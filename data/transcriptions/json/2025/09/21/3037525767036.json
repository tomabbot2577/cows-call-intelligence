    "text": " I'm sorry, can you hear me? Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. I couldn't barely hear you. I'm just calling to help get my Outlook linked up with my PCR. Okay. Can you do a screen share with me? Are you trying to do, like, the Outlook portal add-in or PCR mail? So it's the Outlook portal. He's a new user. so we need to get his Outlook portal set up and also make sure his phone number is all connected to within PCR. Oh like RingCentral? Yes. Okay I have another call scheduled for to start in seven minutes could I give you a call after that I could send you a meeting invite and then you can just kind of jump on. Yeah yeah okay yeah and let me do it this way I'm going to so you have RingCentral Yes. Okay. Let me do this. I'm going to set it up through RingCentral. That way, in case I need to take over screen share, it'll work. Just to make sure I don't run late for you, if I'm meeting with her at 3, how about like 3.30? Would that work? That works. That works. Okay. And what is your name and email address? So my name is David. Okay. And my email is davidp.com. Okay. Okay, let me bring up your information here. And I'm really sorry. I just know this might take a little bit, and I don't want to be late to anything either. Okay, so let me see if I have you in here. I want to make sure I have you in my database, too. Okay, well, I don't. So let's see. Let me add you in here as well. David. So I assume your last name starts with a P. What is your email address? Or, I'm sorry, what is your last name? Panuska, P-A-N. Okay. You USKA. Okay. All right let me send you. I'm just gonna say PCR setup is a the subject line. Okay, so let's plan for 3.30. Are you kind of flexible as far as schedule, like if I end up a little bit sooner? Yeah, that's fine. Okay, so if it ends up a little sooner, then I will, I'll just shoot you an email and say go ahead and join now, if that's okay. Sounds great. Yeah, that should be worst case scenario to be 3.30. All right, I am sending the invite over to you now, and you can just join right through your RingCentral app, And that way if I need to take over screen share, we could do that. Can you, I just sent it. Can you double check that you received it? Might take a moment to get over to you. Yeah, that's fine. Yep, I got it. All right. So we'll talk soon. And again, if this meeting I'm about to do, it's actually setting up a portal as well. if it doesn't take very long I'll shoot you an email to go ahead and join sooner. Okay sounds great thank you Robin. Alrighty thank you alright bye",
