I wanted to see if you had a couple minutes to talk about PC Recruiter, maybe getting you set up on a database and kind of talk about how that might look. Give me a quick call. I'm going to get a moment. I'm in the rest of the day today, all week next week as well. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks and hope to talk with you soon. Bye-bye.",
