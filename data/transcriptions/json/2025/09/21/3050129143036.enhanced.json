    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, I'm sorry. I just took a lot of food. So my boss just downloaded PCR capture today. Mm-hmm. And instead of letting him do the overview, all it's doing is just taking it directly in the PCR. It's not letting him do an overview at all. So what that sounds like is that he has basic mode turned on in the capture tool. So basic mode is as advertised. It just does a quick import. Yeah, we update that. Did you refresh the tab after turning that off? Mm-hmm. And it's over to the left and grayed out? Yeah, let's hang on one second. I'm walking through his office. Okay. I'm on the phone with them right now. Click on your PCR, he said. It'll capture me. And he said, yeah, it's grayed out. Okay. And then he refreshed the tab and if he clicks the click to capture it, the overview screen's not popping up? No. Okay, I would need to hop on a screen share on that computer to take a look at it here then. Okay. So let me start up a meeting here. Do you need our work phone number? I called from my cell phone. No I just need an email address to send it to. What's a good email that he has access to? A-A-B-M-R-D-A-V-I-B-S-O-N.com. All right. Just sent that on over. Mm-hmm. And, yep, he'll just use that link once he gets it. Just put your name in there. Yep. Perfect. and then if he sees a pop-up to join with audio or video he can just exit out of that box and hit continue without audio It's not saying anything about – there it is. It's right there. Join. He's going to talk to you right there. Join with audio. Join. Okay. Tell us one more time. I was going to say you don't need to join with audio. I just if he could just share the screen okay yep and then you'll see a blue box with an arrow in it at the bottom of the meeting window that says share right now it's blacked out and you could just exit out of that okay let's continue with our audio okay yep and then you should see that blue box at the bottom of the meeting window okay that says share you'll click on that yep and then you'll want to share the entire screen so it'll give you an option for which screens you have you'll just click on it to highlight it in yellow and then you'll hit share again in the pop-out box It didn't give us any others. He clicked entire screen, but it's not letting us hit share. Does he have more than one screen? Yes. Okay, so you'll actually select which one. So it'll say entire screen, and then you'll have like options underneath it. Okay. You'll click on which one and then perfect. all right so go ahead and exit out of the capture tool there for me and then let's can you open up like a linkedin page for me okay no i'm not screen i'm not screen you want it on the same screen yeah the screen that you're sharing okay and then just pop into any profile just want to see okay somebody that you haven't had it yet yeah I think they've added him already. Oh, no, because it says click to add. Okay. Do you want to do the click to add? Yes, please. Okay. Now, Derek gave me the options before it hasn't been giving me the options. It went directly to the default company is what it's been doing. But this is what I wanted to do. Okay, perfect. Maybe we just need to do it on the phone. It's like taking your car to the mechanic. Yeah. It stops making that noise. It was making that noise before I got here. Yeah. Yeah, sometimes, especially with Chrome, it can be a little weird. like especially with this being a new fresh session like in a new tab the chrome extension has to like reload with the new settings so i would just go from here just you can exit out of that well we have you on the phone if uh if it reappears like that what would be the next step we would do to try to bring back this comparison screen, the default screen? I would just exit out of Chrome and reopen it. Because with that old tab that you had, it was just holding the old capture settings. So starting a fresh Chrome session is what caused it to load with the correct settings this time in that fresh tab. Okay. All right. Very good. Thank you. Yep, no problem. Have a great day. All right.",
