    "text": " Thank you for calling Made Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Russ Hovindek with Client Staffing Solutions. Okay, let me pull up your information. How do you spell your last name? Pardon me? How do you spell your last name? H-O-V, like Victor, E-M-B-I-C-K. Okay. I was doing HEU. Sorry about that. What can I help you with? Well, you know, I haven't called back. My resume inhaler hasn't worked quite a while, and I'm thinking, why am I inputting these resumes in single-handedly? Okay. It could be that. So there was some change, and way more technical than I am, I'll be honest. I don't even know. Oh, okay. so something changed about the location of where it has to pull things or something so it sounds like if it hasn't been working for a while and might just need to update it okay do a screen share with me okay do you happen to have ring central or no no let's see here okay so I'll just send you a Google meet hold on one second yeah that'd be fine sure okay and when I do this very poorly don't yell at me okay uh it shouldn't be too hard I'm just trying to remember the steps to update it but I don't think you have to turn it off we'll have to see on that okay so let me go to meet new meeting start an instant meeting okay I'm in just got to add you you're going to get an email from me in just a moment yep and I'll have a link in there to join sure there you are So we are talking about the resume inhaler for bulk importing resumes, right? Correct. Yep. Okay. Yeah, some of them, like the old, if you had a much older version of the PCR portal added for Outlook, it was kind of like the same issue. Those folks don't want me to update. Okay. All right. So I'm going to go ahead and mute since we're already on the phone. I'm going to have you do the same. Otherwise, we're going to get a lot of echoing. Yep. No problem. Okay. All right. So at the bottom, it's still echoing. Did you turn off your speaker stuff? Yeah, I did. Do you want me to mute it? Yeah, mute down at the bottom. How about there? Much better. I think it's brilliant. If you are on the phone and doing this, it just has a lot of background. Yeah, I know. Okay, so here's what I'm going to have you do. At the bottom of your meeting screen, there's a share screen option. It's the rectangle with the arrow in the middle. click on that once the window pops up go over to entire screen at the right gotcha and then click on which screen to show me and then click share okay so what i'm going to have you do is open up a browser tab All right. I'm on the screen it has MarketWatch. Are you on a different monitor? Yeah, I actually have two screens, two monitors. Yes, I'm seeing the one that says MarketWatch. Can you go over to this window? Yeah, let's see. Let me think here how I get you back over there. I could probably do it off of that if you want yeah so in your screen they yeah go to your monitor that has the tab open it says market watch and go to a new tab okay go to type in PC recruiter downloads All right. So it says downloads. Click on downloads. Okay. That first link, yeah, click there. Okay. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. So, I'm going to go ahead and click on download. Okay. You notice I don't have any windows open, right? I just got a few open. Yeah, a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Maybe after this you might want to update Chrome, too. It looks like there's new Chrome available. Okay, on this page, let's scroll down here, and we're going to look for the update for the resume inhaler. Okay, so it's in that middle column. Yeah. I see it, yeah. Okay, so that green link that says download resume inhaler, click on that. Okay, it's downloading at the top right of your browser right now. I'll have to wait till that finishes. Yep. Still showing there's downloading, but... Yeah, it's also got the number two. I wonder if you clicked it twice, possibly. I maybe double-clicked and got a problem, huh? Possibly. Should I back out of it? No, just hit... No, just click on it. We'll just wait for one of them to complete. We don't need the other one. Okay. Okay, click on one of those. It doesn't matter which one because they're the same download. Okay. So you should be getting a prompt. Yep. Do you want to make changes to your device? Yeah, hit yes there. That's one prompt that these meeting screens don't let me see. Is it happening to show on your other screen? Yeah, it's showing on my primary screen right now. Okay. Let's have you do that. Let's have you do stop presenting. I'm going to have you show your other screen. This is probably okay, I think, because it's showing on my primary screen that I usually use. So I think we're okay. Yeah, I can't see it though. So if you could slide it over on top of this download screen, that would be one way. How about that? You like that? Perfect. Okay, hit next. Yep. All right, you want to hit change or repair? Just hit repair, I believe. Hit repair again. Yeah, I think I'm mine. I think I uninstalled and reinstalled, but I think this should do it. Finish? Yeah, let's try finish. Okay, let's go to your inhaler icon now. Let's see. We're going to have to – it's going to be on my other screen. Let's see here. I'll see if I'm – Yeah, if you want to do stat presenting, and then you can, like, do a new share and just show me the other screen. Do stop sharing? Yeah, do stop sharing. Yeah. Okay. And then go to do a share again. And then go over to entire screen, but pick the other monitor. Since that's when it seems to be working from. Okay. Can you see that now? Not yet. It's showing, so I evidently haven't switched it over to the other monitor here. Did you click on the monitor and then hit share once it pops up? Yeah. Let me just – I'll click out of this again. So, my question is, is how do I get it over back over on the other screen here that you want to see? We need to pull it up, right? Yeah, I'm going to have you here. Let's do stop share. Yeah, did that. Okay, let's hit share screen again. Okay, so, I'm going to have you here. Okay, let's hit share screen again. Then click on entire screen over at the right. Hang on. Let's see. Okay. Okay, are you seeing you now? I'm not saying no. Yeah, hit stop presenting for a moment. Let's try that because it's not even showing that you're stopping the present. Oops, you left the meeting. Yeah, sorry. Can you go back to my invite? Yes, I'll do that. We'll just start from scratch. Okay. Okay. Are you showing? Okay. Yeah. So hit share screen down at the bottom. Go over to entire screen. Then you'll see the previews for each of your monitors. Click on the one that I should be seeing. That's what I did wrong. Sorry. That's okay. You're going to forgive me, Rhonda? Robin. Robin. Yeah. I'll forgive you. Okay. So let's do this. Down by your date and time or by the weather, actually closer by the weather, there's that up arrow. Can you click on that for me? Here? Yeah. Show hidden icons? Yep. Click on that. Okay. And you want to click on inhaler? No, I don't even see it there. Okay, I don't see it there. So let's go over to the very far left where it says type here to search. Click it in that field and type the word inhaler. Yeah. I might have had it closed. If it's open, it's not there. Got it? Okay. and click on this? I think, yeah, let's do that one. Normally it'll show up in my taskbar. Once you click it, usually you should have like a desktop icon. Yes, it'll show up right there. It's showing on my taskbar, so we got that. Okay. Okay. Do you think it's up and ready to roll? Let's try, let's go to actions. Action, action, action. Okay. Go to connection settings. Okay. Hit test. Right underneath that green section over at the right. Just want to make sure it's got closed. Perfect. Okay. Successful results. Okay. anything in that folder? We can try it. It needs to be imported? Okay. Yeah, let me just go ahead and do this for you. Oops, got the wrong one. Yeah, if you put those into the folder that you monitor. Okay. Let's see. It should pull up. Got to figure out where I find my... If you drag that screen over to the right... Oops, sorry. Yeah, click back on the inhaler again because it'll tell us what the path is, like what folder you have it set to look at. Okay. The screen before it. Click on the previous one. Okay. Okay. Oh, so here it just said okay. That one seems fine. Or close it. Okay. Okay. All right. So it is looking at, ooh, I can't see it. Desktop PC recruiter candidates. What does that say? Okay, that's the folder you want to put those in. Yeah, I've got to figure out how to get there on my computer. Let's see. Yeah, so they should be on your desktop. so if you go the window behind there with me got a few windows open yeah it should be like if you go over to left just yeah click right no not there go I'm just a little bit yeah go down just a little bit right there click right there that should bring that that window on okay now on your desktop if you have them copied click desktop okay it looks like you actually the folder right there these are critter Canada Candace to import yeah okay yeah I know my foot over there. Okay. Okay, so you definitely have some in there. And you could right-click and paste to add more in. Right-click. Yeah, right-click. Yeah, just over to the right, right-click. Okay. And select paste. Does it look like you copied those files, right? Right. Okay. All right, let's now go back to your inhaler window. And go to Actions. Import folder. Looks like she's going Some of these may be old now I think your computer is running a little slow though yeah i've got a lot of got a lot a lot of windows open here right right now i do day trading or day losing maybe it's called day losing i'm not sure now what you could do as well i don't know if you know like if you could set your inhaler that as long as you have it open like you know you've got to come in and like click the icon on your desktop and it actually opens that's when it's like down you could set as long that it just automatically monitors that directory which means that folder you see those options at the bottom right so if you check the monitor directory option okay when when it gets done or can you do it now do monitor directory and then do monitoring on okay nothing we do is let's go to actions up at the top left go to preferences couple of these got in here because they're a little small maybe see where it says 2000 maybe make it like 50 sure I probably just type it or even go to 100 and then I always I usually add a zero at the right for the All right. What if I just type it in? All right. No, no, no, no, no. Do a Control-Z. No. Undo that. Undo that. Control-Z. Control-Z? Z. So undo. Yeah. Okay. Click at the end of that and add a zero. Don't replace it with a zero. Okay. Okay. Hit okay.
