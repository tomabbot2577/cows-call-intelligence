    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hey, this is Rebecca. I am looking to actually add a seat in PCR. I just wanted to see what the process was to do that. Like a new user? Yes. Or are you thinking about maybe the, what's it called, the portal licensing tool? I'm adding somebody to my team, and so I need to have a seat for her. oh okay so you want to actually add like a user to your account i see um that's kind of like a sales question i think um let me see um you mind holding for a sec i think i want to ping my salesman and be like and ask him because i'm kind of new to that question i've never heard that question before sorry sure uh one second Rebecca, let me figure this out. Hello, are you there? I'm here. I think he's at lunch, unfortunately. It went straight to voicemail. So adding a user, you know what? Let me ask my boss. I'm going to just try this one more time. Sorry, Rebecca. Sure. Give me one second. Thank you. All right. No one is answering their phone. Do you know how to create a username, Rebecca? I don't know. Okay. Well, here, we can do this. If you want to create a new username, I can help you through that for your new employee. And then we can deal with the billing aspect maybe, like, later through the ticketing system. I can make a ticket say, like, hey, Rebecca called in. We created a new user. She wants to add one more user to her account. And I'll put the billing and sales department on it, and they'll reach out to you through that. Does that sound like a reasonable plan? Yes, that sounds good. Okay, great. So are you an admin user of PC Recruiter? I am. Cool, cool. You've never created a username before for anyone? I have, but it's been, I mean, a couple years. Okay. All right, one second, Rebecca. Rebecca, let me find you and log in as like your user or whatever so I can see exactly what you see. What company are you with? Expanded Talent Solutions. Expanded Talent Solutions. Give me one second. Let me find you. Expanded Talent Solutions. There you go. Rebecca Thompson. Is that what I saw? It was very fast. It's Rebecca Thornton. Thornton. Sorry. My eyes just went to the most common TH name. It flashed on my screen and then went away. All right, so I'm logging in. What's the username you log in as? Hang on. Let me see if I can log in. I'll get back in. It might not matter. I think admin works for me. I logged in as the admin user. So I'm just going to walk you through adding a user. Okay, so I just need to log into the admin portal? No, you can log in as Rebecca. It looks like your username can do this. It has permission to create users. Okay. Well, I mean, it is an admin, so I guess let's just continue with this. Sure. All right. So inside PCR, you're going to want to click System at the top, the main toolbar option. Uh-huh. And then under that, there's Users on the left. And then when you click Users, Manage Users will appear in, like, the middle area of the top frame. Mm-hmm. From there, there's an action called add user on the top right in the action menu, or perhaps left when you've moved it over. And then a window will open. So here, you're going to want to fill out all this stuff. Not all of it. Not all relevant, but we can go through it. So the full name will be like the person. That's not the username. Give it a name. If you want to give their email address in there as well, that would be helpful for a couple of the features of the software. But under security information, you'll see username, password, and verify password. Those are like the three most important ones, I'd say. You can create the user, give it a password, verify the password, and then don't hit save quite yet. When you've gotten that far, let me know. Okay. Okay, so the left-hand side, there's like different tabs. Could you click on security? Uh-huh. And then there is kind of like your decision here now on like how much access to the software you want this new person to have. I don't want them to have full administrator access. but I want them to be able to add in stuff, just add in records to the database. We don't do a ton of work in PCR, so just enough so that she can maybe import a list into PCR, do a sequence if she wants, but I don't think she needs full admin. Let me explain a bit about how these permissions work. System administrator, do you see that at the very top? Yes. It says no permission. Don't let that like daunt you or anything that can stay at no permission. That's, that's basically a setting that if you set that to full permission, it will override all the other settings. If you say, if you set that to full permission, basically all the other settings don't matter because you've given them full system admin permission. So you can leave that at no permission. but you want them to be able to add in records. Those would be like all the individual permissions underneath it. Okay. You know what, here. I still want to delete anything. And you know, add, save, add only, add, save, add, save red, full permission for change company, allow customize and allow customize. Okay. Basically you could just set all these individual permissions to what you need. and if you have questions, I can kind of answer what they do. If you said you wanted them to be able to import, data transfer is set to import by default. If you want them to export, you'd have to change it, though. Okay. You probably don't want that, right? You don't want a new employee to be exporting all your data, right? Yeah, no. Not quite yet, maybe. No. Anyway, that particular setting would be called data transfer, and that's under other. If you wanted them to be able to export, you'd have to change it to import export. But it's import by default. You said sequencer. Synchronization? Is that what it is? No, it's called data transfer. It's on the left column under. Oh, got it. It says import only. Yeah, that's default. That sounds like what you maybe want. sequencing is at the very bottom of that column, you might want to allow them to add, update, or maybe even give them full permission to sequencing. It's under other on the left column all the way at the bottom. And it's currently read only. I changed it, I think. Yeah, I did. Add update. Cool. What else would a general person want to do? Anything under security policy? Security policy should be, you don't have to, unless you want them to change their password when they log in. Like if you gave them a temporary password and you want them to make their own, you can check the box for user must change password at next login. login basically the first time they log in with the password that you're creating now they'll have a chance to set their own that could be something you want to do unless you want to know their password um no it's okay i i'll get it so i just saved it um and i still have her profile pulled up under here anything else i need to do sure do you want her or he they uh to have like a specific layout? Do you want to transfer your layout to them so they see what you see in terms of the default field? I think that would be helpful and then she can change it if she wants to. Let me refresh my screen. Manage users you just created. Who did you just create? Onyx? Mikey. Mikey. It's not at the top. It's at the bottom. You want him to be able to customize his layout, right? Yes. Customized layout for names is no. Do you want me to change it to allow? Sure, that's fine. Okay. So now they can update their name card if they want. Okay, so if you want to easily copy your layout to them, go back up to the system menu and the search bar, search copy, just the word copy. and that'll bring up a various amount of things you can go to copy user settings okay and in the window that appears you can select the source username at the very top that would be like your username or or i guess oh i guess i guess your username isn't a uh an option there it could be we can make that so if you'd like um does the admin user have a good layout that you want to copy or do you want to copy Rebecca's layout? I think I only really use the admin setting so I think it's fine yeah. Okay let me see the admin okay it is definitely different than the defaults. Cool all right so that that'll work all right so then under copy user settings you just select the user you want to copy in the top left so I guess admin and then And expanding down all the things under that, there are different sections of things you could possibly copy. You don't want to really copy everything because if you did their security preferences and security policy, that would basically make them an admin user. So you want to skip the user records section. If you want to just have them see the same things, you want to go to the name, company, position record section and then copy or check the boxes for name, company, position, and my PCR layout. Or maybe you can skip my PCR screen. I don't know. My PCR screen is kind of customizable for every user. But you'd want to select the boxes for name, company, and position under there so that they see the same things when they go to a name, company, or position record. and the record card ones in the middle of that are like the little recently viewed tiles you'd see uh when you click name position or company in the top frame um those are customizable if you want to copy the same thing there you can check those boxes uh and then maybe if you want to copy like your roll-up list layout you can go down to roll-up lists and so that if they go to a roll-up they'll see the same like columns um and that's kind of i think maybe all you'd really want to check. And then make sure to pick on the right side the correct database, which it looks like there's only one. And then make sure to pick Mike E and then hit save. And that should copy everything from admin that you selected over to Mike E. And then they should log in, change their password, and see what admin sees on those. Okay. All right. Everything's copied. Hit save. Yep. Does that seem like what you needed? Yes. Now let me ask you as far as login goes, do I give her the same login screen? Like how do I tell her to get in? Is it a specialized URL? No, it's the same URL you'd be using just with her or their username and password. Okay. I got in as her. Now, will she have all the same... She doesn't have anything in her database right now, correct? She should be logging into your database. So she should have access to all the records in that database unless you guys are using... I think there's a setting for that where you can hide things. Like if it doesn't have the Mike E username, she can't see it. Is that what she's... Is that what you're talking about? No, it's okay. Okay. No, it's okay. I got her. I got her. And so let's see. All right, cool. So I'll just copy this and send this over to her via email and her password, and she should be good to go. Yep. And then I'll create a ticket in our ticketing system under your name and say send it to the billing department and say we added a user today. Can you update that? Yada, yada. and they'll reach out to you on those things. Okay, great. Thank you so much. Yeah, you're welcome. Anything else? Nope. Awesome. All right. Well, Rebecca, thanks very much. Have a good rest of your day. Call back if you need us again. Will do. Take care. All right. Yeah. Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a good day. Bye.",
