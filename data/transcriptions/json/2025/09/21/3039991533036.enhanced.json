    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. This is Hazel from Customer Success Team of RingCentral. I'm hoping to speak with Gretchen Kubitschek. okay um well i don't know if i'll be able to connect you with gretchen i don't think she has a active ring central account that she monitors all day but i could definitely transcribe whatever message you'd like and send it to her in an email if that's okay um yeah i can go ahead and send her an email but the main reason why I'm calling is because this is just in regards to the request that she recently submitted about their RingCentral account. So well I can send her an email yeah and if you could like let them know if she can respond to the email that would be greatly appreciated mckenzie sure i'll just let gretchen know that your like ring central customer success is going to send her an email and we'll watch out for it that's it that's all you want me to do okay oh yeah sure thank you so much okay yeah absolutely what what email do you have for her just to make sure it's a good one oh do you have her best email address here so i can use that let me see actually let me double check because um some of the some of the like the the ownership kind of swapped roles here i don't know if they got new emails let me make sure uh let me see i'm gonna ask when i'm gonna ask my boss real quick in a direct message in discord does gretchen still have the same email address ring central customer success is on the phone right now and wants to speak with her i just want to make sure make sure ring central has the right email email to reach her all right So hopefully he should answer relatively quickly. Let me see. I'm going to try and send an email to GK. Gkubacek at mainsequence.net. I guess that should be still good. Gkubacek. Oh, yeah. That's also the email that I've got here on file. So maybe I'll try to send her an email later after the call just for us or for me to be able to get in touch with her too. But thank you so much for your time, Mackenzie. I really appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. Did you have a good one? Thank you. You too. Thanks. Bye-bye now. All right. Bye.",
