    "text": " You can ask them the same question. Thank you for calling me. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. How are you, man? Good. How are you? Well, let me ask you something. I'm a current subscriber. So how much AI is incorporated into PC recruiting? So we have just released our AI features to all of our customers as a free trial, except for the AI search, but that can be requested to be added to the trial for free, so that's still available. But there just are a few features currently on your database. So there would be job description AI generator, which is just a click of a button and it generates a job description on one of the position records. The next one is AI candidate summary that would, you know, click of a button, generate a summary for a name record candidate. The third one is AI email generator, and that will give you some prompts. You know, what tone do you want this email you're about to write? Do you want it to be casual, friendly? And you just follow a few prompts, and it will generate a starting place for an email for you. So those are the three main ones. But AI search is also available. We'll talk to this guy real quick. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I've got a potential partner that wants to talk with you about your services. If you wouldn't mind just kind of talking with him briefly, okay? His name is Tom. Yeah. Hey, buddy. This is Tom Passarelli. I am a principal in a physician recruitment firm, and we are using the homegrown system now. We're trying to work our way out of it. So we have a bit of a dilemma. I guess it's a good dilemma to have. We've got about 30 years of data that we keep current that we've got to port over to a new system. So that creates a sort of a problem of its own. But the thing I want to really ask you about is how you deal with email campaigns, in other words, with high-volume campaigns where the targets are not opting in to a list. How do you deal with that? the bounce backs and all that kind of business. What is the process you use? So we kind of function as a middleman where you develop the email inside of our software, PC Recruiter, and then you connect to your email provider, whether it's Office 365 or Gmail, and we relay the bulk email over to them and they send it out. So we don't impose any limits on how many you can send, but the provider might, you know, whoever your email provider is. But as people unsubscribe, our software will automatically keep track of that on the email opt-out list so that if you go to send them another email, it won't go through. But they don't have to opt in initially unless your database is set up for GDPR, which is for British or European laws. Right. Right. So, yeah. Yeah. So, OK, so that answers that question. With respect to what I just alluded to, this idea of porting over data, you get into that at all? You see people coming to you with legacy systems? Yeah. Yeah, we definitely have a pair of people on our conversion team that work with new customers who are interested in getting data from their current software over to PCR. and they've seen a large range of different softwares that we're able to convert the data over from. So, okay, so if I want to reach out to you maybe in the near future and ask you maybe a little bit more about that, I'm going to get your number from Rob, I guess. Okay, perfect. Just maybe text him my number and my name so that he knows if I call him. Okay, that sounds good. Thanks very much. I really appreciate it. I'm interested. His name is Garrett. Garrett, is that your name? Yes, Garrett. Garrett, I'm interested. It's been a useful conversation, and I'm going to reach back out to you soon. That sounds great. Or a number from Rob. I guess you answered at random. Yeah, I'm at the support line. Yeah, happy to help anytime.",
