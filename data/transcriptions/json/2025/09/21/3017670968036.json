    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, this is Rick Wolf. Hi. Hi, how are you? Oh, God, I just am pulling my hair out here. Just, I can't get this thing to work. I mean, I got a couple to work, and now I'm trying on another lawyer, and I can't seem to get it to connect in terms of making a record. So what are you trying to use to connect? I'm not clear on the issue. Okay, so I'm using the old Outlook as the PCR bridge to create a record. Okay. All right. So you're trying to like right-click on a resume, or what are you trying to do there? I am in a lawyer's record in their law firm. I tap on the V card, which is how I always do it. And then it has the progress bar in terms of making a record. I go to my PCR and it doesn't show up as a name that I've worked with. and I am in PCR within Outlook and I can't find the record, the new record. There's an old record for the guy, but not a new record. The old record was at a previous firm. Oh, let's see. I probably have to see it. I really don't do much with V cards, to be honest. Let me send you an invite for a meeting. Hold on one second. OK. Ignore whatever time it has. I just booked it for an hour, though. Got to change that. Can I do an hour? I might get two, but don't worry about it. I said don't send. Okay. Okay. Rick Wolf, troubleshoot, join Google Meet. Use microphone and camera now. Join now. I don't know. Open the people list. Hold on. Hold on one second. I didn't open it. Did I open this? No. Hold on one second. I don't need that. I don't need that. Okay. So if you can go over to your Outlook. Show me where you have the V-card stored. Where did I have the card stored? Well, why don't I just start from the beginning with this guy and do it that way. so there he is right here and what I did was I went up here to V and I pressed on V and I pressed on open file and since this is a new one I'll try open again and that takes me to Outlook PCR synchronized contact synchronizing contact so it should be synchronizing or synchronized now right I believe I honestly never really use it this way so I don't really get any V cards what was his last name Stamp Stemple. Stemple, okay. S-T-E-M-P-E-L. Or, excuse me, Stemp. Okay. That's my problem. Okay, so go to name. Yeah. Up at the top. Type Stemp for last name. Yeah. And then hit search. Okay, now he should show up at Kirkland. There he is. No, that's James Stemple. There's an Albert above. Yeah, and that's from years ago. Yeah, it may not move companies on you, because even when you have resumes, we don't move companies or anything like that. Let's click on that existing record, though, and let's go to activities. okay nothing for eight years okay let's see who's your outlook experts well I just I don't know about the v-card one let me just see do you normally just save it first? I just do that and then it saves it. If you go over to, because that goes over to your Outlook, right? Right. Let me see your Outlook down at the bottom. So was he in your contacts? Like if you go over at the left? Oh, with these guys here? Yeah. Let's see what's over there. Let's try this. Just do Albert and then do percent stem. It doesn't get made. I guess we could go to a different name at Kirkland and try making a contact with a different person and see if it's just that card I guess that's where it popped it up did you actually save it I wonder no you don't need to until it's there I mean I don't know let me see who names today Eric Hiber was brought in let's see activities Can you go to another person and try the process again? I just want to see it a little bit more. Yeah. Let's do that. Give me one minute. Let's just go to people. Let's try this guy here. I'll try this guy. Okay, that's the part I got to see a little bit slower. Okay, what do you want to do with the V card? Okay, so I guess we go open, right? Or do we just go save? Let's see what we have here. here. Open. Click on PC Recruiter and sync. And it does a synchronizing contact. So now if we looked up Kelly Buckley, we should find a Kelly Buckley. not in there okay no let's try something else then let's go let's just do a different firm see if uh maybe that'll work This guy, they don't have it. Okay, we'll try something else. Go ahead and try Arnold Porter. We can try Save As and Save As. We can try save as and see if that does it. Let's see what happens there. That's not going to do it. Okay. let's see what happens when you save nothing does save this try just open which is what I always do synchronizing contact you saw the progress bar okay now so Kelly Buckley Kelly Buckley was the previous one wasn't it Callahan you just did you went somewhere else after her yeah okay Okay. Oh, man. I'm not going to do that person. Nice, simple. How about James Clark? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so now I should be able to track James Clark. No match. Now let's go down here to here. Let's go to name. Got nothing in there. Yeah, they're not in the database because we're not even getting activities. So that's just what is it? What's going on here? Give me a favor, try hitting log out, log in, just for a moment. Let me just see something there. Where is log out? Up at the top. See up at the top middle, right after it says like selected message and what database you're connected to. I don't see where you're telling me to go. Here in the gray? No, down a little bit and over to the right. Okay, tell me when we're there. Right there. There you go. And then hit login. Okay And let's go to options Which is just a little bit over from the left From where their logout option area was Got the green register options Okay Okay, it's 530 You're in top 300 As admin Oh, why is that password so long? That's a little odd Yeah, it is that. Can you test connection for me? Yeah. Okay. Well, that's really, really strange, though. Okay. Can you type your PCR password where you see all those dots? Can you replace that? I just want to see if it has something to do with it, because that's really strange. I've never seen a password to be that long. Yeah. No, it's not. Something's wrong. I need to find my PCR password now, so bear with me. Okay. So where do I go now? Click options. Options, options. Up at the top. At the top. Right there, you just passed it. No, you just passed it. It's got the green wrench icon. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Take that out, whatever that is. I'm just connecting it all, but let's take all of that out. And then type your PCR password, just remember it's case sensitive. Okay. And then hit test connection at the top. Okay, hit okay. Hit save and close. Okay, and I'm going to have you hit that log out option and log in again just to see if that makes any difference at all. no. You can then hit login. Okay let's go try one now and see what happens. I have no clue if this is it but it just seems kind of odd that there was a password. I'm surprised you were getting in at all. That's kind of weird. Okay we'll do open. Okay. His name is James Clark, right? Right. James Clark. Let's try to hear if that works. You left his name. You got a bunch of James Clarks. I can't tell if it's him. That worked. Uh-oh. Oh, wait. Hold on. Maybe it didn't. No, it didn't. Oh, the Veronica one in. Veronica Callahan is in there now. Okay. The one with Arnold and Porter K. Scholler LLP. Let's try another one. Okay, what do you want to do? Make another contact? Yeah. Okay, bear with me. Let me see his name. Full name. I don't know if I really like that PC being there. Okay. All right. Let's try the sync. Yeah. All right. It's Robert. Who's the one that we tried to save on? Was that the Callahan? I don't remember. I think so, but I'm not sure. I wonder if we had to hit save first. Can you go back and try that process using save? I can try that, but I've never had to do it. Okay, so we'll just go to downloads. Where the hell are they now? okay you want to try Veronica Callahan no I don't want to do her because that's when it is showing up I want to try somebody else okay I'll go find someone else I'll try a good old Dan Sack That's his LinkedIn page. That's different. You have to go back. That's right, yeah. Let's see where we are here. Okay, so I didn't do that, so now we go back here. There's one thing I'm seeing. Let's go in your Outlook because I didn't have a Synchronize your Outlook contact. Let's see. Let me take a second. Oh, God. I'm going to try him again. Let's do the... That's the wrong one. That's the right one. That's the V. Let's try the save add. Oh, okay. I will just try canceling that. Oh, God. No, just hit open file again. Okay. Try File, Save. There? Mm-hmm. Okay. Now you want to go try and find him? What's his name? His full name is Zach. Daniel. K-Zach, C-H, Z-A-C-H. I guess we could put a percent sign afterwards. What if you hit Peace Recruiter now that he saved? Okay, so we'll go to Peace Recruiter. No, no, no, the ribbon on his card. Oh, okay. Now try it. So he's saved. And now we should be able to go to try Outlook first. Not finding him. Let's put up percentage sign-in. like when you go over to your contacts over there and there's nothing in there right I mean, would I use PCR and go that way rather than through here? I can see all the . Tyler in here. Well, we've moved this up. 14. Okay, today's the 16th, so it shows. Okay. Yeah, the names aren't in there. We did get the ones somehow, but I don't really know what you did different, or at least she's showing in here, this Veronica Callahan. I feel like that was one that you tried. Yeah, we could try it different. another firm. Either that. I mean, she had a simple name. What if you go to somebody else that doesn't have so much in their name? She was just Veronica Callahan. She didn't have any commas or credentials after. Can you find somebody else like that? We'll just do that. Hi, Tyler. I have Tyler join us. I'm on with Rick Wolf. Hi, Tyler. Oh, capability. Yeah. The only other thing I'm thinking of, maybe some of these names with the designations could be causing an issue. Yeah, but it really shouldn't because we use the percent sign in those. No, but it might be causing it to bring the data over to PCR. Oh. Okay. So if you could go pull up a person. Yeah, hold on. I was just... I'm normally good at these guys, so... I'll try Denver and see what happens. Try Andrea Austin. She doesn't have any extras in her name. Okay. Okay. Okay, VC cards. Okay, try what you were doing before, just doing open, because you said this used to work. Click open file. And then do your PC recruiter. synchronize now you're sure you never had to save it before right never saved it not a one all these years okay so I'm here we're ready to go see if we can she's in there I think it's the names then I think that's what's going on a lot of those names had like comma and then like credentials I'm trying to mark E. Baker. Let's just try something like that for a moment. Okay. That's what I'm thinking now. Because we were just trying like four of them and then one of them finally showed. And then I kind of caught my eye that... Okay, let's see what happens with Mark Baker. Okay, bear with me. names. He went in. Okay, he went in. Now let's go back to that one here, like that Robert Eberhardt or the Daniel Zach. Those that you were trying. Look, Kelly Buckley, didn't she not come in either? I don't know. Okay, let's try this one. We also at one point found that he had like a really long string of characters for his password and portal. I don't even know how he was connecting. So he also changed that too. Let's see what happens here. Okay. Okay, let's wait a moment. Now that one's not coming in. Okay, so let's search on the... Okay, so it's just not doing it. Yeah, can you do open file? And maybe we just get rid of this here. Yeah, and what I noticed even with Mark E, I would probably even take out that middle initial too. I think it like first initial last, or first name, last name, because they put Mark E as his first name. Okay. So we're going to save. No, no, I'm going to close that reminder that's popping up for what I just sent you. Okay. Okay, now try, hit enter, or I'm sorry, not enter. Oh, let's do it. No, no, hold on one second before you do that. Where it says Daniel Zach, remove this space at the end of his name, and then tab down where it says file ads. I want to see if it has anything to do with it because I'm not sure if we lost one. It's about three spots down. There we go. Okay, now try it. I'm on job title? No, no. Now go to Pizza Recruiter up at the top. Now go to synchronize. Okay. That went to Nachman. Well, I guess we can go to another firm yet and just see if one works there. I'm going to do that. I haven't really used this in so long. It's been a while since I even tried with a V-card or anything, so I'm kind of stumbling around here. It's okay. Let's try Dania Abassi. Let's see what happens with her. Okay. Okay, she looks like she's all right. Ah, she was found. So this is, that's good. This one is at least identifying her, that she already existed. yeah so I'm guessing it has something to do with the name or the person's profile yeah yeah there's got to be something different with some of these okay well I guess we've got a couple to work I'll try one last one and then we'll call it a day Richard this guy might be in here I'll try he's got no email I don't know if I'd even trust that one he's a partner retired Yeah. Go for an associate here. Rick, did you hear Tyler, what he was asking? No, I didn't. Can you go back to Daniel's? back. Okay. That was his LinkedIn page, so we need to go to his VIA card. Yeah, and here's what firm was he at? He's not in your database, so. Okay. What firm was he in? Are you able to hear him at all? Are you able to hear Tyler? Okay, because I can hear Tyler. Oh, gosh, that's right. Oh, shoot, sorry. I brought him in on the meeting, and I'm on the phone call with you, and I'm thinking, sorry about that. Okay, if you can do this. I am so sorry about that. That was kind of silly. If you can go to your Downloads folder, which would be your yellow folder down at the bottom. Or you could go there. Okay. Go there. Go to open file for Daniel Zach. Okay. All right. Maybe that's required. Can you put in a company for him? Yeah. Looks like it would be Kirkland and Ellis. Yeah. Yeah. I just put them in the default though. I'll just say Kirkland and let it go at that. Okay remove this space at the end. Remove this space at the end. Just make sure it's nice and clean. Okay. Now we're going to try just like this to roll out if it's company versus name. So go ahead and hit PC recruiter, synchronize contact. Okay. Okay. Hold on one second now. Let's see. New names. Daniel Zach Kirtland. He went in. Okay, so you do have to have a company it seems. So maybe some your profiles are not getting them. Good catch, good catch Tyler. Yeah so Rick so we're thinking that it's with some of those pages that vCard didn't grab the company name and you know a peace recruiter requires a a company, so that's why I couldn't seek it. Yeah. Yeah, but probably it was just that one page, because like some of the other ones, when you're on another page, that's what I was trying to narrow down, was it name versus and again, Tyler noticed that it's a new company. It's a good thing we brought him in. Thanks, Tyler. He says thank you, Tyler. Okay. He said more than happy to help. All right, so just keep an eye on that. okay alright thanks again you are welcome thank you you too bye you too bye",
