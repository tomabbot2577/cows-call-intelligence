When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press the pound key for more options. Hey, Brian, it's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. Wanted to give you a quick call, just checking in. Following up to just see how the AI trial was going with you with PC Recruiter. That AI suite was on trial, and it's actually been released on trial to everyone for the summer, so it should be there at no cost, good through the end, like Labor Day or so. So I wanted to see what your thoughts, see if you were thinking about adding that or if you have any questions. Give me a quick call if there's anything I can do. 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.",
