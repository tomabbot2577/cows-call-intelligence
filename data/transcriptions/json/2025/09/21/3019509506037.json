    "text": " Thank you for calling MainSegments Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Will from Maxwell Management Group, and we heard that the PCR now has AI features available, so our Heather is wishing to schedule a training session with our team members. Is it possible for scheduling a training this week or later next week? So we aren't offering free training on the AI search, But I can send you a video with a step-by-step guide on how to use the features that were added. And if you have any questions, you can reach out. But most of the features are pretty simple. They're just a single click of a button, and it'll generate. So let me see here. You have three that have been added to your database. I mean, one is the job description generator. the candidate summary generator and the email generator all ai and those are just kind of click a button on the toolbar and it generates those for you the only one that's not um automatically installed is called the ai search and your contract signer heather would have to send us an email saying that she would like that turned on for your database Yes, sure. I understand. It would be good if you could send me those videos and resources so our team member can watch and learn. I do appreciate that if you could also send me the rates that you offer for a short brief training. Because Heather still wanted to talk with one of your representatives because she is having problems with her dashboard. I believe that's something I've covered before last year. So just if you don't mind, just give me all the options you have, would you? Okay. Yeah, I'll send you an email about the options for training. What is your email address? It's well at maxwellmanagementgroup.com. I think we have emailed before. Okay. W-I-L-L at MaxwellManagementGroup.com. Yes. Perfect. All right. So I will send you an email with those instructions and then the options for purchasing training. Yeah, sure. Yeah, because apart from all the training the tools I wish to talk to get the dashboard sorted out. Okay, perfect. Yeah, sure. No problem. All right. look out for an email from me soon. Yeah, sure. Thank you so much, Gary. Thanks.",
