    "text": " Hello, Jim. Good morning, Drew. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? I'm not bad. I just wanted to call you, and it's been so long since we talked, and I had a question. I thought I would just call you instead of chat you. That sounds lovely. I miss seeing you. I miss seeing everybody. I see James. That's about it. Yeah, you're working at Carbons? Do they have a... Yeah, for the moment. yeah they uh they gave me a space here for for a few weeks while the kids were at school out here and then like apparently they're paying for the space for me to be here but i i told uh bill i was like i don't need to be here when school starts so if you've got an end to the deal with them you don't renew it because it's silly for me to drive out here yeah because if they're not out here anymore yeah yeah yeah and it's actually saving me money to stay home even I do like coming to the office, but I'd rather have the gas money. I think Bill was talking about maybe getting a little space somewhere. Both of you were thinking about it. They had wanted to. I think part of it was just the expense of it, trying to find a space that was affordable and yada, yada. So who knows? But I'm sort of banking on the fuel savings as an offset to the insurance. so if I can not spend 30 bucks a month on gas then I'll not spend 30 bucks a month on gas but that's always good yeah yeah how you guys doing we are all right just we were on vacation last week we were yeah we had a ball at the KOA out there oh nice it's fantastic and we did this one was a resort which is like the highest level because they have a restaurant and all these activities and pool and everything like that and they had so much like random activities going on the kids loved them like that's good we tie-dyed we ate ice cream we did cotton candy we did a duck race we did a train ride just all this crazy stuff is cool do that stuff it's fun yeah yeah we're uh we're doing um i'm trying to remember it's it's it's in mackinac city um they're mackinac mackinac i don't remember if it's mackinac or mackinac i think they're different places oh yeah um i've never been there that's all the way at the tippy top yep right northern northern michigan it's like six hours something like that but we um yeah we're doing we're staying in the cabin which will be nice because the last couple times we've been at a k away we've just taken the tent with us so but the cabin was like because it's weekdays and it's sort of the tail end of the season it was like 300 bucks to stay there for the week so that's That's good. Yeah. So we're going to be there from Monday to Thursday and we're going to, um, we're taking the dog with us. So that'll make things a little cheaper. And then we're, um, we're able to take him with us to most of the places we're going. Apparently Mackinac Island is a very, um, dog friendly place. Like there's only a couple of things we wanted to do that you can't take. They actually have a dog friendly escape room you can go to where like you're allowed to bring the dog into the escape room with you or like the person at the desk will watch your dog if you want to do it which is fun and then um there's a museum like a maritime museum and they said you you can't bring the dog into the museum but if you have two adults and you want to buy one ticket and and share it while somebody stands outside that's totally fine so i was like that's a really great policy to have they're like sure you know rather than losing both you know both sales we'd rather have your family come and buy one less ticket to split between two people you know so yeah it's a smart idea are you going up to that island where there's no cars isn't that Mackinac's island yeah Mackinac whatever it's called yeah whatever it is I can't remember but yeah so we're staying on the in the city on the opposite side and then we're going to take the ferry over to the island and go hang out there so yeah that's kind of the plan crossing my fingers that the weather is suitable. So, yeah. I've always wanted to go there. I'm interested to see how it is. Yeah, we'll find out. I will let you know. That is it. Yeah. Excellent. Well, my question, I was on just a call with someone, kind of a demo. They actually have an app, and they were looking, A, for something for their company to track their hiring and contacts, but also maybe if it works well for them, they might want to integrate it to their app or offer it as a piece of their app. They have an app for yacht brokers and yacht people and people that sell yachts and charter yachts and everything like that. So they wanted to maybe offer a hiring system as part of that eventually. Interesting. Okay. But they liked the job board and they asked me if there was a couple of good sites that I could send them to lock into to see it in action. And I didn't have any off the top of my head. And when I went to our website, we don't have any. Yeah, we don't have any jobs. And our job board was never a great example anyway, because it's not a typical. Yeah, there is. I mean, not that this is helpful. I'm going to send it to you anyway, just so you have it. There is actually a list of all of the ones that I know are available. That said, not all of them are great. and unfortunately some of the ones that I really like are like either they either they're not using PCR anymore like some of the really good ones I had have kind of gone away unfortunately or they're so customized that I would be like that's not really a good example of what it does because it doesn't normally work that way but that page is my is kind of my go-to for kind of sifting for there's a lot wow is there a lot there are a lot um you know like i said some are good and some are not um this is what our site map gets built off of so basically anytime we launch a job board i add it to this list and then um nightly we spider through this and find all of the job you know all of the jobs that are in it build a site map now google doesn't visit all the time. But let's see here. Let me, I'm just kind of opening a few. Let me send you a couple that I'm finding as I go that, that I think are, are nice. I should add that if they are using WordPress, we are, or I should say Mike is in the midst of building a much improved version of the WordPress plugin that actually puts the jobs into your site rather than it being the iframe. So the apply stuff still goes to an iframe but the um but the uh job list and the job pages are actually pages in wordpress which is better for a lot of things really um better for search engines better for control etc that probably will be i suspect a higher cost point because it will be more involved to implement it um because it's not just a paste this into your page and go kind of thing it's more of a, you know, this, this is going to interact with, uh, it's going to interact with their site in terms of, um, like being part of their WordPress and therefore shit in their site can break the way the job board looks. So there will be, it'll be more kind of, you know, testing and putzing around to get it loaded, but it will be a nicer, uh, experience. I think I'm not sure how close we are to launching that because it needs some um it needs some more stuff but um yeah i'm looking to see if there i've been just kind of pasting them as i go to find like when i find nice ones um yeah i'll set up two or three yeah and a lot of them you'll find they're like very very similar but there are a handful in here where i know that i did some nice customization on it and I probably if I was smart I would keep a list of them as I go when I do a nice one I should probably go oh that was a really like that was a pretty one and probably should be kept um let me see here who else because a lot of them are very very similar but there are a handful where I've I've put you know really significant work into direct recruiters actually isn't a terrible one I've put some good work into customizing them. But where's the one I'm thinking of? There's the one in like down in the – it's like a foreign – is it Global Expat? Is that the one I'm thinking of? Let's see here. Their website is a little sluggish, but eh. That one's not terrible, but it's not the one I was thinking of. Global ESG I don't think is the one I was thinking of, because I don't think Global ESG is actually using the job board anymore. No, I need to take them out of the list. Unless they just moved the job board to a different page, but I don't see PCR on their site. Let's see here. Do they have their current openings up here anymore? candidate services, client services, resources, about ESG, search process. Do they not have the job board in the site now? Hmm. They may not. Are they still using PCR? What is that? Global Executive Solutions Group. Global Executive Solutions Group. They show 53 users. They're pretty big. Yeah, so I was wondering why we're not, there's no job board in their site though. Like I don't see PCR in their page or anything. Candidate services and offerings, executive search, career advisory, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Contact us. Yeah, they don't have the job board in the site. The page that loads when you click on their Global ESG job board is no longer there. GlobalESG.pcrecruiter.net. Global ESG, let's see if they're using. They are, yeah, they have 41 logons this month, 29 in the last 24 hours, so they still seem to be using. They're in Fairlawn. I've never known of this. They're Cain customers, so I haven't really heard of that. They're just not, you know, what I'm going to do, for the moment at least, is I'm going to take the landing page link out of their thing because the landing page that they were pointed to, globalesg.com slash top talent slash searches, does not exist anymore. They have taken that page down on their site, which means their job board links are going nowhere. If they're trying to use the job board, nobody's getting it. So I've taken that landing page link out because they have a job board. There's like 20 some jobs in it, but that's not who else. Who's the one I'm thinking of here? Goodwin. Goodwin's not a bad one. There was one though that I was like, it's a really nice. It's a really nice job board. And now I'm just kind of sort of eyeballing these to see if I can spot. And then we've got some in here where they're just, you know, they don't have any jobs. They have it in their page, but they don't have any positions listed. Markham. Is Markham a good one? Damn. I wish I could remember. who it was because I know that I have at least one or two where I've done some nice twiddling of their, of their shit where they've got, I've got that. Those few you've selected are more than, more than enough for me. Yeah. I mean, those are some decent ones. Um, yeah. Cause I have, for whatever reason there, I know that there's like at least one where I've done, I mean, those are going to be a decent, uh, sampling anyway. But I know that there's at least one or two where I've done some really nice, pretty tweaking. I love that the J Power's recruiting that they're... It's a turd. The share logo has not been set in their website, and so they're getting a poop when you share their... I think that Discord does that for some reason. If you share a link that doesn't have something in it. Yeah. It made me laugh when it showed it's an angry poop. Yeah. Walker level It's not terrible either. I'll put that in there also. I think they're newer. Walker? No, they've been around for a while. Really? Yeah. That's a good one. They've got some nice stuff going. If somebody wants an example of what the job board is like, that's probably. And I'll keep that link. But yeah, that list is like everything that I'm aware of. There may be other clients using the job board out there and there may be people in that list who aren't using the job board that I, you know, I try and check now and again. You know, to see if I run into something in there and it doesn't load anymore. I'll try and update it. But yeah. Cool. Awesome. And I did put that script into your demo database. um keep an eye out for it yeah yeah they uh they wanted to like they really wanted just something to show them so when they're clicking through to see this is a bad email so if they talk to them they can say hey we got a bad email yeah and that'll do it yeah because that was that was the thing that was in there and then when i reported hey this stopped working when we did the themes um rather than fixing the styling they just added that little button next to the next to the thing which serves the same purpose but it's not just on the screen like you know you'll see the little circle with the x if if the person's opted out but it doesn't tell you why so okay yeah man all right thank you bye",
