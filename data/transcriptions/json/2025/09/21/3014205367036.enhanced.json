    "text": " Hello. Hello, Ms. Robin. How are you? Not too bad. So I messaged Sean about that because I was talking to him the other day. He's like, oh, let me know if you run into anything weird that I used to help you with. I asked him to get the LinkedIn links for her mega-batch to open in Chrome instead of Edge for Portal. He said there isn't. The only thing would be to try to change the default app for that type of URL, but he thinks it still opens an edge because it's a Microsoft product. Yeah, I thought I was able to do it, but what's really weird is that here, let's see, can I switch this to a screen share? You're going to activate, oh, because it's recording. Okay, we're going to pause recording. Quit micromanaging me. Oh my god. All right, hold on one second. I'm going to do a meeting with you. Hold on one second. Start. Do you want to open up your RingCentral? Yeah. So his version of Windows was even different from mine, though. But we did see a couple things, but it was really weird. Join without audio. I was like, I don't know. And I couldn't even open up my Outlook. Let me see. I brought out my old computer, but I don't think it's going to let me really do anything. Yeah, I can't even use it. Hands are kind of tied. Let me know when you're ready for my ID. Or you just put Robin Mantoni as one word. Okay. So let me share screen two. Okay. I'm never going to catch up on all these emails. Yeah. Okay. So let me share screen two. Okay. I'm never going to catch up on all these emails. Okay. So what I used to be able to do is type the word protocol, choose default app for each protocol, and then you would go down to oh I could do anything with it this is a different computer than what I had before let me see my other computer hold on one second I pulled out my other laptop since I had a problem doing my meeting and everything froze up on me protocol Let's see, this one's worded different. Oh, okay, so I think the link type is different. But... Let me see. Is this other Microsoft one an option? Yeah, I was looking at all those, and I didn't really see any that would change it. So what I used to do, I think it was this HTTP and HTTPS. You just set it to here. So even if you got something in Edge, if you clicked a link, it still opened in Chrome. yeah it's a different kind of link though because it's embedded in that web view too although you know what when i would do it i don't think it was even really from let me think about it i'm trying to think even when i did it it might have just been like somebody had their linkedin url i wasn't really doing it from a name record yeah the doing it the url one that's those are the settings that you can change like all right i'm just going to tell them it's not possible yeah i don't know it's sick because it was even weird because like let's say you did open something um bear with me one second here i'll just go to one of mine i'm so glad you're back me too i wish they got that back okay so let's say you went to somebody and you click this link like see how I'm getting all of my stuff up at the top yeah I wasn't I wasn't even getting that when I opened it up why is this check the connection check the firewall well that's interesting oh that's because look at the bad link okay i wasn't doing on this record that's unrelated um i'm gonna go to somebody else because that's apparently a bad link now this will be a newer one like let's say he did do this in portal it was not even opening up like this even in edge you didn't see any of this. It was just literally these three options up here at the top right. Which is very odd. Well, like I said, because I don't think it's a full browser. It's the WebView 2 open in the link. Alright, he'll just have to open it up. There's no way to... Shoot, I don't think there's going to be a way to... So probably if it was doing it in an email body, but not from the record. Okay. Yeah, the email body, it'll work, but the record, because it's that embedded WebView2, is what jacks it up. Okay. I was looking online, and even to have WebView2 links open in a different browser, it has to be encoded. in the program. It would have to be put in portal. Oh. Hmm. And I even... So Edge WebView 2. So that won't even recognize your extensions either then, right? Yeah. No, it won't. I don't think so. Okay. Because I even put the... So what do you call it? The capture? in his edge to see if, well, if we did that, could it pop up so that you can recapture? Yeah, let me. Because you could go to start from edge. And let's see. I don't know if I did it from this computer. Did it extension? you can like start in Chrome and then add PCR capture to edge you just get it out of the Chrome Web Store you just got to start from there even that wouldn't work yeah I'm trying to get it now you yeah I'm trying to download it an edge now I'll open it just to see Pin that. Alright, so that's on Chrome now. Now open up Outlook Classic. Go to name. Go to this one. Now the extension's not there. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, it's just the limitations of WebView2. Okay. Alrighty. I'll let him know. Alrighty. Alrighty. Thank you. No problem. Alrighty. Bye. Bye.",
