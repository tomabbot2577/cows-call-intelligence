    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon, Jim. Good afternoon, Chris. How are you? I'm well. How's everything going with you? Not too bad. Not too bad. And I think that we're waiting on Jason, I think, as your trainer for PC Recruiter here. He is not quite in yet, but I expect him momentarily. Okay, no worries. I've got to look for the link. I've got to log into it? No, no. Today's just initially kind of an intro call, handoff call to him. He's going to have a few questions to kind of go over your needs and what you want to cover in the system, how you want the training to go, et cetera. And then he'll get the first several sessions on the schedule. So that's how that will work. Are you in training already? I am. I started training on Monday. So this will be my first week. Awesome. I thought you did. Yeah. Yeah. So next week they wanted me to start, I guess, start making phone calls. But I really, I have a whole list of people on a data sheet that I really don't even know what to make heads or tails of. So I was hoping to at least get some direction today on how that might look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we should be able to do that and get a couple of things scheduled. I'm just trying to get into your account here. I think it's Jason's, the trainer. I'm just kind of checking the record to make sure. Yeah, it was. That's who we were emailing back and forth to. Okay, perfect, yeah. I'm trying to find the original. It looks like there's a unique link that you need to get into it, from what I remember. And I'm trying to find the email with that link on it. That would have probably come from McKenzie. let's get Mackenzie Scalise is his name and that would be your unique URL and admin username and password or in that email as well I might even have it in here because I was cc'd Here, McKenzie, I found. Okay, yeah, I found it. Awesome. Now, is there a way you can set this up on the desktop so that it's pre-set up, or do you have to just go into this login URL every time? you can see some people save it as a favorite so they'll save it as a favorite on their desktop or save it as a favorite in their browser i leave i use pc recruiter i leave my browser open all the time with it there and i i have my time out set to a stupidly obscene highly amount of minutes so it never times out so i just go right to it so i keep a browser open tab open right into it so you can certainly have no problem okay so yeah i'm in i'm in the site now I just don't they said they they exported the data over to it but I don't know how that how to access that it should be in there and it should be something even if you just go to name leave everything blank and hit the search there's a little magnifying glass button in the upper right hand corner if you hit that search that should just do a blank search and it should pull up all the data there. Okay yeah it came up. It looks like it's multiple pages. Yeah you know and it might also be already on a roll-up list so probably I would imagine they have it there. I just popped Jason a quick chat to see what was going on with him there. Yeah, no worries. Yeah, but that data's in there. Like I said, they likely pulled it in on a roll-up list, so it's probably under a roll-up list. so all the data will be under there as well. And that's a nice way of looking at it. You can page through it. You can see all the data right from there. So that gives you some different options there as well. Okay, yeah, if I click on Roll Ups, I see Account Managers. I see Ops Managers. I guess Regional Sales Managers. Sales Engineers. Warehouse Automation Sales. Okay. Jason just said he's wrapping up his last session. as I thought he would he'll be there in just a minute so we'll give him a minute to get in but yeah so they imported a roll-up list so anytime you need to go to any of that data you can go right to that roll-up list clicking on the individual name will open up the record in the bottom frame I believe with dimensional search they even give you a specific format so your screens going to be formatted everything will be set up like that so that'll be good and then Jason's going to go through with some of the nuances of setting up your username and setting up various different things in the system, train you how to utilize the system, train you how to work through if you want to send mass emails or sequences or anything like that. You can do all of that in there as well. Yeah, that would be good. I definitely want to be able to set it up on the automation because I don't want to send an email to every person. If I can do what you call, I guess, a roll-up list where you select what people you're looking for. Is that how the roll-up works? Yep. Yeah, you can go to roll-up list, and when you have that list, you can apply what we call a sequence to that specific list. So essentially, as soon as you hit activate, everyone on the list gets the first email. And then based off of what they do, if they open it, maybe they go to your call list. If they don't acknowledge it in two days, maybe they get a second different email or something like that. So you can kind of set it up, and it'll kind of matriculate based on what they do and how they respond, and then it'll move through. and there might even be some sequences already in there as well because what's fortunate about dimensional search is they pre-populate your database with some templates some formatting some some tools already in there which is nice so you get more than the average user would get starting out on PC recruiter perfect so my CJ's drawing how can you get it to get on yeah me yeah hello Jason how are you I was having an issue I had said it's to make sure what's working I'm good how are you very well very well I've got Chris Ortiz on the phone as well here and he is with dimensional search we're going to run through his his initial consulting call today and he has already started training so he's had the dimensional search training class this week it started this past Monday. So he's already had a little bit of background, knows a tiny little bit about it, but it's going to need to kind of get everything scheduled up and get everything set up. So Chris, I'm going to be a main contact for anything like if you need to add users, drop users, billing questions, anything like that, that comes to me. Jason's going to be the one to get you up and running and trained on the system. How-tos, stuff like that, you can get in touch with him direct. We also have a whole support team. There's a chat on the website. So a lot of different ways you can access people. But he'll be the point person for how to and to get your training. So today, he's got a few questions to go over with you just to gather some information about your use and desire set up of the system. As I said, kind of since you're with Dimensional Search, we kind of know a lot of the basics. So we already know that you're going to need higher EC. We know that you're going to need RingCentral integration and stuff like that. So We already know a little of that, but here's a few other questions. And then at the conclusion of that, we'll get the first call on the schedule to get everything underway. All right. Sounds like a plan. Very well. So, Jason, I'll turn it over to you. Hi, Chris. I'm Jason. I'm going to be the first person training you on. Nice to meet you, Jason. Nice to meet you. I think I'm having a little delay in my – sorry. I apologize for that. I think they're coming a little delayed. So the questions that I'm going to be asked, they just kind of revolve around what our training sessions are going to look like, the frequency, different things that we are focusing on. So we'll just pop through those really quick. The first question I have is what type of recruiting are you going to be working in? Is it permanent placement, contract placing? What's your focus there? Permanent. Okay, cool. Have you worked as a recruiter before? No, my first time. Okay, cool. And is there a specific industry or niche you're going to be focusing in? Warehouse automation and material handling. Okay, awesome. In the next 12 months, do you anticipate adding any additional users? That's a tough question, Jason. I don't know. We're coming up. It's August. I would say through the end of this year, no. But if things go as I planned, maybe for the new year, I will bring on somebody to help with calling or resourcing or research. So it could be a possibility. I don't know if that helps you in any way, but I would leave it open. OK, awesome. Yeah. So if you do want to do a situation where you want to have additional users, just reach out to Jim and he'll help you get all that stuff changed in your billing. Have you worked with a CRM or an ATS before? I have, yeah. I'm from the car business, and we have a CRM system that we've always used. It's evolved over the years, so I am familiar with the CRMs. Perfect. Okay, this one's going to relate to the training speed at which we go. So you have a total of 10 hours. Each training session is going to be more long. So in terms of that, how frequent would you like to meet a week? One time, two times, or three times a week? In the beginning, I think we can just do one or two classes. I feel like there's a lot of support from Dimensional Search also with Victor and the other team. So they know this program very well, and I can get some information from them also. So I would say initially we'd set up one training. you tell me. I mean, I want to start getting on the phone next week. So if we can get at least the initial class out of the way and that will get me started, then I can work through it for a couple of days and then I'll have more questions, I would assume. And then we could maybe do a follow-up. I just don't want to do both classes back to back and then I have a ton of questions because I really didn't pick anything up. I think an hour worth of information might be enough for me to get at least started. Okay. So let's start off by doing, let's start off by saying two a week because I want to make sure we can get you up quickly. And then maybe we can roll back to one. I want to maybe get to sequencing, which would be around hour like four. So ideally, I'd like to do one tomorrow if you're available and then two next week. And that should get you a little, that should get you to the place where you feel comfortable like reaching out to people and calling. So we'll get that scheduled in just a second once I finish up these questions. What operating system are you using, Mac or Windows? Mac. Okay. And what browser are you using currently? Right now I'm in the full browser for Apple, but I can use Google also as Chrome if I need to. Okay, perfect. Let's switch over to Chrome just because there's an extension in there that's really helpful. I'll download Chrome on my computer. Perfect. Awesome. And who is your email provider? Like Microsoft? Yes. Microsoft. Okay, perfect. You need my email address? Let me see. Is the one you were invited to this meeting with, is this your personal? Yes. I had to check all this stuff before I got the company email. I had to get a domain and change up the name and do a DBA. It was a lot of extra stuff. But now I have a working email through Microsoft. Perfect. I'm going to change the PCR ticket that we have with you. I'm going to switch it over so that I'm contacting you through your work email as well to kind of keep those filtered. What is your work email? It's going to be my first initial, C, last name Ortiz, O-R-T-I-Z, at, my company name is Oroquest, is O-R-O-Q-U-E-S-T. Okay, .com? Yes. Okay, perfect. Awesome. And a few I have to answer. Just give me one second. Okay, cool. So why don't we get something put on schedule for tomorrow? I'm fairly open. What time center are you? I'm in the East Coast. I'm in Florida. And just for point of reference, I have another call with Augustin tomorrow at four with PCR also. I'm not sure what capacity he is with the company. Do you know who he is? I'm not entirely sure, honestly. I've not heard of him. Maybe he works for dimensional search with regard to PCR. I don't think he works with us. Let's see. Let me take a look. Oh, yeah. You know what? He's a research and tech training associate with Dimensional Search. OK. I figured I have a call with him tomorrow at four o'clock in the afternoon. OK. And I guess what we're going to be talking about is. Let's see here. Provide a tentative date and time frame. Yeah, he says, yeah, I want to schedule our first session to explain a little bit more about how the training will work for the PCR overview session. So I guess I'm going to get two trainings tomorrow. This one's at 4 o'clock, so maybe we could do it before. Yeah, absolutely. I have class. is, I only have class tomorrow afternoon from 1130 to 1230. So if you wanted to do it before that or after that, that would work for me. You said that was at 1130? 1130 to 1230 Eastern. Do you want to do 10 a.m. tomorrow? Would that work? Yeah, it'll be an hour session. Yeah, it's going to be an hour long. It's just kind of, yeah, 10 to 11. And just to kind of gear you up for what that first training session looks like, it is fairly administrative because there's just kind of some status stuff we have to do, like connecting your email, connecting RingCentral, general tour of how PCR works. But with any leftover time after doing all the admin stuff, it's going to be devoted to just kind of talking about how to add records and different types of data storage. But just be prepared for a little bit of that time to be utilized to be setting up admin type stuff. in terms of next week are there any specific days or times that work best for you to put on two different days to be yeah I'm trained for a week so usually I have class between 10 30 and one o'clock on those days and then I have other separate meetings that I have in the afternoon between 5 and 5.30. So anything outside of those times, I can work with you on. If you want to do them before class again, like those 10 to 11 slot, I think that would be fairly easy for me to squeeze that in before class. Yeah, absolutely. Do you want to say on Monday, would 10 to 11 work? Yeah. Okay. And how about Wednesday, same time? Wednesday? Yeah, let's do that, 10 to 11. Okay, perfect. So, I'm going to get those scheduled and sent over to you, and we will just kind of dive into the course material. But did you have any specific questions for me? no to prepare for this uh you just want me to download uh chrome to my computer so i can yeah browser and is there anything else i have my logins and stuff so i'm already logged in and it looks like they exported the data already for me oh perfect um let me know if there's anything else i need to do to be prepared uh so we can make the most of our time together yeah there There was an email that our tech team should have sent you that had two different things to download. One of them is Amazon Coreto, and the other one is the PCR launcher. They're just two pieces of software that are necessary for PCR to communicate with your computer. I can resend you that in an email, those links to download those, but they're just necessary for PCR to work, and they're device-specific. So we just need to download those to your computer as well. Yeah, if you'd resend it. I don't remember seeing it in my email. I've had a barrage, as you can imagine, of emails coming between Alphagod companies and people within DS. So, yeah, all you have to do is click on the links and download them, and that's it. Yeah, it's pretty simple. You're going to download them in order, though, so just make sure you download the first one and then download the second one. Do you want me to send that to your work email or the personal email? Yeah, you can send it to my work email. We'll send it over to there. Perfect. Okay, awesome. that is all I have Jim do you have anything else no that is all I've got I'll leave it to you to get everything going and again anything you need as far as adding users dropping users let me know or if you don't know who to go to I can be a resource as well yeah you've been very helpful Jim thank you so you were helpful getting all this stuff set up but yeah that's perfect so just to recap Jason 10 a.m. to 11 is going to be our slot for tomorrow, the 8th. And then we're going to have the 11th and 13th of next week, 10 to 11 Eastern. Is that correct? Yep. Yep, exactly. All right. I got you on my calendar now. All right, perfect. So I look forward to talking with you tomorrow. If you can, just send me that email tonight or later this afternoon. Absolutely. And I'll get those things downloaded and I'll get Chrome on my computer also so that we're ready to roll. Okay, sounds good. Thank you both. All right, gentlemen. Have a great afternoon. Thanks again. You as well. Bye.",
