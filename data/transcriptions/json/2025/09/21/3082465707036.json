    "text": " Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Teresa, and I'm with World Bridge Partners in Omaha, Nebraska. I actually just hung up the phone with somebody, and I guess I should have tested it before we hung up. We have Zoom phone, and he just supposedly launched it for one of our databases that was not connected, but I still cannot get it connected. Okay, and I'm sorry, what is your name? My name is Teresa. I'm with World Bridge Partners of Omaha. Teresa Hale? Yes. Okay, let's see. I'll pull up my information on that stuff because I have not done that. You're doing the Zoom phone integration, right? Right. Okay. Thank you. Maybe I have to read through the stuff because I haven't really done this one much. I have too many customers using it yet. Okay, which database are you in? Omaha, Maine. And what is your username? Mine is TLH. TLH, okay. Initial authentication of Zoom with impairments will be done twice for each user. Okay, let me see here. Okay. You're not currently logged into Zoom. Click the link below to authenticate. Okay. Can you do me a favor and go to system? under in the main tool yeah in the in peace recruiter on the main toolbar go to system okay and go to users oh you know what I'm not logged in as me I'm logged in as Chris maybe that's the problem yeah yeah try logging in because you're trying to set it up for yourself right no I'm trying to set it up for another user what is the user you're trying to set it up for cmc okay but he does not have admin privileges okay so you'll have to log in as yourself okay and of course i don't know what my password is um i'm at his computer let's see can i do it from my desk or do i need to be at his computer You could do it either way. You just got to be logged in as yourself because it looks like there is a step that you have to do similar to a RingCentral setup that you have to do as an administrator. Okay, hang on. Let me get back to my desk. Okay, I am here. I am logging in. Actually, before you do that, because there is a little note, just to make sure that it doesn't recognize your own login, do you use Chrome? Yes. Okay, open Chrome in incognito window, which basically means if you're logged into your Zoom account, It won't try to recognize you, that you'll actually be prompted for their credentials. So if you have the Chrome option at the very bottom of your computer, usually if you right-click, it's the incognito window. Okay. So log into Peace Recruiter in incognito through Chrome, but as yourself. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, so you're going to go to System on the main toolbar. Okay. Then go to Users. All right. Click Manage Users. Okay. And then click on the username CMC. Okay. Next to the contact phone field, click the gear icon. Next to the contact, say that one more time. So once you click on the CMC username, underneath full name, you'll see the contact phone field. Click the gear icon just to the right of that. Oh, there we go. Okay. Zoom. Zoom. And then see where it says authenticate? But you'll need to sign in as him. Okay. And his email address. I'll put you on speakerphone so I can type. Okay. See, let's put in his email address. Oh, come on. B-M-C. What's this? And I'm going to send you these detailed instructions. It looks like they put the serial code in, but it didn't do the other stuff. All right, this happened to me before. it says application not found should pop up a window now let me try it again Zoom, authenticate. We had this issue before when we, oh, third party cookies blocked. That's why. So let me turn this on. Now let's see. Allowed. Sam authenticate. Still not doing it. You allowed third party cookies in the site. When I click on authenticate, it keeps telling me application is not found. Okay. Hold on a second. Let's do a screen share. I'm going to send you a meeting link. I'm a little stumped here. I may think start an instant. Oh, wait a minute. Let's see. I'm looking to see if there's anything I may be overlooking. Is it a paid Zoom account? Yes. Okay. I sent you a link to join a screen share. On my email? Yeah. Okay. I clicked on the link and it took me to a help screen. Learning Center? Today. Oh, there should be another email coming in. Oh, gotcha. That was the one with just the instructions. I'm trying to walk you through, but we're not getting very far. Sorry, that's really weird. One went to that and one went to junk mail. Oh. Did I hit the wrong thing? I must have hit the wrong thing. Good grief. Meet.google, right? Yeah. There we go. Now, when you go to join it, you don't need to use the camera or audio. since we don't need to see faces. We want to watch the screen, but we're also already on the phone. Right. Otherwise, we get a lot of background noise too. Where it says join call, I clicked on that link. Okay. And it might be asking you about... Oh, you know what? I got to move it. It's not allowing me to do anything. I got to move it out of junk mail. God, I hate this thing. I hate junk mail. Okay. There we go. There we go. There we go. You without microphone. I don't need to have a camera, right? Correct. No camera. I'm going to have you share a screen. So you can be in your PJs if you want to be. Okay. So I put you in. Okay, so what I'm going to have you do is click share screen down at the bottom. It's going to pop up a window. Go over to the right where it says entire screen. And in the meantime, I'm going to go into one of my databases and see if what happens when I try to put that Zoom code in. Okay. Okay. I wonder if I should use install. Holy moly. yeah just um just make that tab like its own like window and then minimize it just don't close it but you or just go over to another window so you don't have to at least look at it okay okay hold on one second i'm gonna put that code in okay so it's not an install feature it's just a serial code so it's not that zoom authenticate okay that's really odd mine opens it up okay so let's see okay let's exit this window for a moment. Minimize it? Just go right back to that contact phone field. Okay. And then okay we're in the zoom tab click authenticate. Why is yours saying marketplace? Okay. I'll be honest with you. Maybe it's sign out. Okay. Okay. Let's close all this stuff then. Okay. Okay. Let's try authenticate now. Let's do that. because mine didn't give me that same screen. Okay. There we go. Now go ahead and sign in. As him, correct? As him. His user, right? Yes. You want to sign in as him. Oh, this is Zoom. Zoom, zoom, zoom. And you were in an incognito window, right? Yes. Yeah. That's just really odd. I would think the incognito would not have recognized that. Oh, now I just missed it. You got the same error. Okay, let's exit. Do I need to have a phone number in that? It's not listed, but let's try it. Okay. and then take out the extension because that would be a direct number I assume okay yes it is all right so let's try it again let's see what happens authenticate Oh. Yeah. Okay. . That said, they've been wrong very quickly. Both organizations have the acquisition. Is there anything? Let's scroll down on this page. Let me log. I'm on my cell phone, so let me log out of my Zoom phone since we're on my computer. Okay. Let me log out of that. Minimize that. That's just really odd. Like, I don't know why it's out of that. Okay, we don't have, we've got his email there. We've got his phone number. what is it supposed to be well there is a like a branding and oaf and everything but then it also has like this client id which i don't know if that would be an issue okay let's hit sign in down here yeah i yeah and then uncheck stay signed in okay otherwise your computer might try to remember you This is stuff we weren't seeing before, right? Yeah, but look where it took us. Okay. Well, we got a little bit further. Why does it keep signing you in, though? It should not recognize you. It's taken us to, we're signed in as him, but it's taken us to a Zoom app marketplace. Yeah, and it's also signed in as you, right? Here, let's do this. Just for sake of easiness, let me. As of 8-5, wait. I am going to... Oh, hold on one second. Okay. As of 8-5, there will be an application at found error after authentication, but the Zoom calling function will still work. It's being worked on. Okay. Well, let's see. what I'm going to say is I can go to his let's go back go back to his desk go back to your incognito window Oh, okay. Let's see here. ACR. Login is me, correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so I got a little bit more detail. Okay, go ahead and do this part. Okay, go ahead and hit save. at the bottom right. Or say that down here? Mm-hmm. Let's go back to contact phone. Here? Yeah. Yeah. It's still saying, um... Hold on, let me see. What if I try to do it to me first? Well, here's what someone said that there's as a 5.8, there'll be an application that found error after authentication, but the Zoom calling function will still work. It's being worked on. Okay. And then what someone wrote, it's looking for the activity writer application, which has not been approved by the Zoom marketplace. So the Zoom phone integration works, but not activity writing yet. So I guess it's some activity writer app is what it's kind of missing. From maternal docs and PCR, I don't know. Let's see. From maternal docs and PCR. Hold on one second. Let's see if I can find out more information about this. Well, I hope that this timeline so that I can speed Central up or slow down. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to give it a try here. Okay, so CMC. The Zoom Workplace app must be installed on the client's device and they must be signed in and it needs to either be either opened or running in the background. the click to dial to work okay so we need to go to his computer I have my password written down now, so I'm going to take it back to you. I'm going to go just at a computer. We're not screwing anything up. I just spilled water all over my lap. Hold on one second. I'm so sorry. It's all right. I knocked over my water bottle, and it went right between my legs. I've done that before. Okay. well at least I'm working from home today so he sees me okay I am back at Chris's desk and I have him logged in in zoom and let me get him logged in here Sign in. Make sure the user has their username. Okay. I'm going to sign in as me. Okay. Do you want to send a screen share to this other computer? Hold on a second. I'm going to try doing this myself. What is the email address for him for Zoom? Sure. It's cmcbratney at worldbridgepartners.com. Okay. Okay. and then what is the password for that yeah capital t okay the number seven okay lowercase m lowercase v as in victor lowercase w w as in william r as in ralph k as in kite and as in nancy so the only capital is the first okay so t capital t7 m v w r yes m m v like m v working right m as in mary v is a victor W as in work, R as in Robin, K as in kite, N as in Nancy. Okay. Correct. Okay, let me try to see if I can do anything with this. Did you get a notification email? On his email? Let's see. Yeah. I think I was trying to say, like, allow another device. I'm just trying to... Oh, your Zoom account is being signed in another device. Allow. Okay, got past that. Okay. I cannot get to that screen at all. Is anybody else using this successfully? Oh, yeah, we all are in a different database. When we first got Zoom phone earlier this year, we were having that same issue with that screen coming up. Okay. And I do not remember. I mean, it's been long ago enough now. I do not remember what we had to do to get past it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hold that one. I'm going to have Garrett join in because if he's seen this before because he's saying like oh you just get past it and I am stumped I'm stumped Okay, here's what I'm going to do, though. I'm going to have you go ahead and join the computer audio, and we'll hang up the phone because I'm going to have Garrett join in, and he'll have to be able to hear us. Okay, I've changed computers. I'm at Chris's computer. Okay, so it's C. Here, I got that email. Okay. This is Amy McBratney. Okay. Yeah, hold on one second, though, because we're on Ring Central. I'm going to have to stay on the phone because I don't have a way to connect. There's no speakers here or nothing. Okay. So Garrett, I'm going to have to join you in on the call. Instead, she can't do it like a computer audio. Okay. I'll call you. All right. Bye. Okay. So I'm going to join him in. So what do I do? I do add.",
