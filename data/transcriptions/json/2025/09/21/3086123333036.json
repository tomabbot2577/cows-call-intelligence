    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yes, hi, Garrett. This is Carla for Talent Solutions. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Thank you. I was wondering if you can help me. I'm in PCR, and I would like to add and update some, what do you call those, some slots on our candidate form sheet. Oh, okay. So you have like a questionnaire that you built and you want to adjust the questions? Well, on our name sheets where we pull up the people names, it has like contact information, candidate information, location information, that sheet. I would like to add some slots there. Oh, absolutely. So, yeah, those are the fields on your name records. You want to add a custom field. Okay, thank you. I could not get that. Name records, the fields, name fields, right. Okay, yeah, I can help you with that. So to create a new custom field, you'll go to System in the main menu up at the top, which is like your icon in the main menu. Okay, and I'm going to write this down, too, so please bear with me. Okay, so go to system. Right. And then on the left, look for custom fields. That's one of your options there. Okay, custom fields. Okay. And then on the right, you'll want to choose name the custom fields because you're making it for your name records. Okay, name. And once you click that, in the bottom frame you'll see a list of all the custom fields that already exist in your database. To add a new one, you'll want to click on the plus sign in the action menu on that bottom frame. So it's probably at the top right. There'll be a plus sign there. Okay. and okay and that'll open a pop-up where you can just name your custom field okay so I want a drop-down menu on the field that I just made So would I put 8 for drop down? 8 drop down, exactly. And then hit save. And there's an extra step since it is a drop down. After you hit save you'll want to look at that list in the bottom frame, scroll all the way to the bottom to find the field you just made. And all the way to the right it says default values. Click on that. Okay. And there'll be a button to add at the bottom of the pop-up window. Click add and you can keep adding in different options that people see in that dropdown, whoever's using the field. So verbal, add, written, add, edit. And, okay, so close. Perfect. You can close that. And then so that's the first part. That's how you create the custom field. field. The other half is putting that custom field into your records layout. So you're making that field visible on your name records. So I can walk you through that as well. Okay. And actually, I'm going to email you after this steps on how to create custom fields and adjust your record layout as well in case you ever need to do this for additional fields. I'll give you some instructions. But yeah, so to put that into your layout, go back to name up in the main menu. The name custom fields? Is that what you're talking about? Oh, no, sorry. Just the word name, like up in the main menu, like where you, yeah, where you clicked on system before, There should be name up there. Okay. Name. Uh-huh. And then open any name record. It doesn't matter which one. We'll adjust the record layout for all your names. And on that name record, in the action menu again, probably at the top right, you're looking for a little gear icon. It'll say customize when you hover over it. If it's not in that list of icons there, click the three horizontal lines at the end, and it'll give you even more options. Just looking for gear icon customize. Okay, I'm up at the top where I clicked on name. um then do you have a name record that's open on the bottom frame yes okay so yeah it would usually be at the top right of that name record top right of the bottom frame there's a handful of icons there uh-huh uh-huh um so you're looking for a gear icon if it's not listed click the three horizontal lines at the end of those icons to see even more options. And in that drop-down you'll probably see the customize your icon. Yes. Okay. That is a. Hold on one second. Okay. Testimize. Perfect. That opens in a new tab and this will show you your groups and inside each group are your fields. So we just want to add that new field. So notice at the bottom of each group it says click to set field. So you could click on that button. It'll let you then start typing in the name of the field you just made to find it. Okay. And once it appears there in the drop-down, click on it to select it and that will be added to the group. And if you want to, you can use the three horizontal lines to the right of that field to drag it upward or, you know, move it around you want to reorder oh okay because i do want to move it around yeah just drag and drop with those three horizontal lines okay and once you get it looking how you want it to look uh top right of the screen there should be a floppy disk icon to save your changes if you don't see it click on the three horizontal lines again at the top right of the screen to find the floppy disk that's saved. Awesome. Yeah. So yeah, once you hit save at the top right you could go back to your main PCR screen, you could close this browser tab and go back to the main PCR screen. And the next time you open up any name record, it'll refresh the page and show you your changes. Okay. Verbal written dismissal. Okay. Got it. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, no problem.
