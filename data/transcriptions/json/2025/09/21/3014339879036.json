    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Rick Wolf. Hi. Hi. Nice to speak with you. I seem to be screwed up here with my PCR. Can we do a session? I'm having problems creating contacts. I don't know whether it's me or whether it's my computer or what. Could you do a session with me, please? Yeah. Hold on one second. You guys changed your greeting around with the call options. Oh, really? Yeah, I haven't even noticed. I don't call in. I'm on the receiving end. Let's see here. Yeah. Do you have RingCentral? No, I don't. Okay. So what I'll do is a Google Meet. Okay. Are you going to send me a link for you to that? Yeah. Yeah, hold on one second. And then before we go away, I also need to talk to you about your new AI offering and how you tap into that. Yeah, you'll have some of it already. The AI search we can't just apply because you have to have, some of our customers are still on loose keyword version too, so it has to be on loose scene for us to enable it. Okay. I'd have to first verify if that's. Yeah. Let's see. Rick.Wolf at ME.com. Is that correct? That's it. That's correct. Email the link. and then when you get in turn off your microphone otherwise you'll get a lot of feedback okay okay so what database do you use is it top 300 isn't that the one you use yeah top 300 right and I see if I can enable this for you your top 300 database Yeah, you would have to be re-indexed first. Okay. So use top 300. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and kind of add it, but it won't work yet until we re-index your database. It has to be on what's called a scene, which is a more robust indexing method. Okay. We're going to have to read, which you actually might like anyway, because it also will probably be faster. Mm-hmm. Enable AI search. Is that a press the button and come back tomorrow kind of thing? Well, I have the code in there, but, yeah, they have to kick off a reindex of your database. Okay. One thing that will be nice is it will probably be faster. It's like the search method. Like any newer customers, they're getting this Lucene already, but any previous database. Okay, so let's see. AI search has been enabled, but need to have database indexed as Lucene. Okay. Database is top 300, and then we called it top 300. Top 300. Okay. AI search. Serial code added. Will they send me a message when that happens? Yeah. They will. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All righty. Okay, so did you get the link that I sent you? Yeah, so do you want people to see and hear you in the meeting and it's got a picture? has the blue allow microphone and camera and then it's got a microphone with a line through it and the camera with the line through it. Okay. Yeah, you can join with that. We don't need microphone or camera. I just need you in the meeting. Yeah, she's got to join. Just ask to join? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right, there you are. Okay. Okay. Hold on one second. Enable. Okay. So what's your issue then? Let's see what's going on here. At the bottom of your screen, you should see a square, I'm sorry, rectangle with an arrow that's your share screen option click that no I clicked at the bottom of your of your Google me screen okay I need to figure this out okay there you are again and allow is that the computer with the arrow in it Yeah. Yeah. Sure screen. Okay. We're starting. Maybe first, could you just go through my user thing and make sure I've got everything set up properly? I use the like to make a contact I load the VCF card and then I do download and sync I guess it is so you're talking about portal? yeah I can't see your screen so when you hit share screen go over to entire screen Oh, okay. Yeah. Entire screen. Okay. Here. I clicked on his Microsoft Edge tab window and entire screen. So I clicked on entire screen and there's a blue line underneath it. And then I have to click on the screen. Yeah, I got to pick which screen to show. right and then I click share okay all right so are you on now okay so if you go over yeah go over so keep this meeting screen open so we're just good but we're going to minimize that we just don't want to close it otherwise you're going to be kicked out of the meeting. OK. Minimize. Yeah, just minimize the meeting. Where do I do that, Robin? At the top right of your browser. OK. So it's still like, yep, yeah, it's that one. OK. And then you can hit where it says meet.google.com is sharing your screen. hit hide at the bottom there okay okay so now so if you're trying to use a portal feature you got to be in your outlook okay go over to your outlook yeah that's it there no no there so can you go over to your main email tab because I think are you in this like they're kind of like their new version are you in your Outlook classic that's what I was just yeah you have to be in the Outlook classic do a window search for the word Outlook so at the very bottom of your computer. Okay. Yeah, we need that Outlook classic. Let's click on that. So it might just be in the wrong app. Yeah, that's what it was. I can tell by the icon. Okay, and then show anyway? Yeah, this is that Google Meet screen that you went in. So let's go ahead and minimize this so that it's not confusing us. Okay. You just happened to open it back up. Okay. And now where is this? This is the old Outlook, I think, right there. Well, no, that's Edge. So then there's Outlook and there's Outlook Classic. So this is the newer Outlook, which does not support things like the Outlook portal. They don't support any COM add-ins. So let's exit this. Okay. Exit out. Yeah. Let's do this. Where it says the Windows search option, type the word Outlook again. Yeah. Okay. See where it says Outlook Classic? It's the first choice under Best Match. Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Is that opening? Like, is it opening on another screen? I don't know. Okay, let's do this. When you get it to pop up the word Outlook. Yeah. Okay, right-click where it says Outlook Classic. Okay, right-click, yeah. and do pin to taskbar okay okay see how that icon is different from the one at the left one yeah the one at the left is their new version which doesn't support add-ins like third-party kind of things we got to use this last one so let's try opening this last one because we got to use this classic version okay let me Microsoft has just, we have, they ruined our OneNote. We'd been on the old version, the classic version, and they made it unusable. So they're not in my favorite category anymore. Yeah, their new Outlook is basically kind of like their web-based one, and it doesn't support many of the add-ins. Let's do this. let's right click kind of look in a dead space so we get to the task manager like right there and go to the task manager I wonder something to like hung up in the back end okay Microsoft Edge Wow yeah 102 windows okay let's go down where it says background tasks let's look for Microsoft Outlook in there and see if we can force it to end. I feel like it's just hung up in the back end somewhere right now. Okay, we're down on Microsoft. Let me just look for Outlook. I always forget how it's listed. Yeah. I don't see it. So when you're clicking on that icon to open up the app, it's not opening, right? Yeah. Okay. Well, let's try again. Hold on just one second. Okay. Got the hourglass, and the hourglass goes away, and nothing happens. Is there a right-click open? Try right-click. Okay. let's go Outlook Classic second from the bottom right or left click let's try a left no why is it not even opening try right see if that does anything Maybe just go to new email message. Oh, let's try open. And you don't have two screens or anything that is opening on something I can't see? No, I don't. Okay. so I have meet that we were on and then there's meet go to something or other stop sharing that's just related to our Google meet so just hit hi there I rebooted when I started today, so I would hope things would be okay. We could try rebooting. Yeah, why don't you try a restart while we're on the phone here. I'll have to get you back into the meeting. Well, you'll have it in the email. I'll stay in. Restart, okay. Restart anyway, I guess. We want to wait for Microsoft Outlook to shut down. Oh, that's what we're trying to, yeah, it seems like it's hung up somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. I'm waiting to see it in the Task Manager, though. Yeah. So, restart anyway? Yes. Thank you. Okay. All right. All right. All these software guys at Google and Microsoft, they're trying to get to be your primary user. He's just nuts these days. All these guys with all of their, wanting to put their cookies on my computer. Okay, so now we'll try Outlook again. This one is the old outlet, correct? I'm on the old outlet now. I can't see. You have to go back into the meeting. One minute. I got to do something here. Okay. You're back, I think. Robin? Yeah. Okay. So down here in the bottom right corner, that's the one, right? Well, I'm going to have you go back to the meeting. So go back to your email. Okay. And if you get to the Outlook, the one at the bottom right, let's have you try that one. Let's see if that opens this time. Okay. So join call. Not now, desktop not now, allow microphones now. Okay, join now. Okay, can you see my screen? No, you're going to have to do the share screen option again. Yeah. Okay, there we go. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so did you do – Okay, wait. I don't think you did the entire screen option. Can you do like stop presenting again? I'm sorry, do what again? I'm going to have you do a new share because you didn't select to show your entire screen. So at the bottom, or you can do like stop presenting. With the hand up? Oh, no, raise hand. Let's just end the call. No, down at the very bottom of your meeting screen. Yeah. You should have your present now option. And it looks like. I'll take it off here. Let's see. I'll just do it. I can't drive with this. I'm going to stop sharing. okay okay I'm going to have you click the share screen option down in the bottom okay but make sure you go over to entire screen entire screen which will be over at the right uh There's join now on the right under ready to join. Oh, it's showing me your screen already. Try it, I guess. Hit join now, maybe because you were in before. Try join now. So the thing, you're in the meeting. Yeah, I see your picture and my picture. Right. So you're in your Google Meet tab? I don't. I'm just really confused. In your browser, it's going to say Meet on the tab, and it'll have like, it's saying you're presenting. Do you see any option to stop presenting? Yeah, okay, up in the top. Okay. Okay. So then what you're going to do is go to the share screen option again, which is going to be at the bottom of your meeting screen. Yeah. But you have to go over to entire screen. Otherwise, it's not showing me enough. Okay. And then I click on that and then I say share. Usually I believe you have to click on that little preview. Okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. And I think we're back now. okay so let's have you open up Outlook from the bottom right okay let's go in here yeah and then maximize it so you have to be in this app to use the PCR portal at it okay so I'm in it now anything that you're able to do before you should be able to do now it's just you can't use that other app if you want to use the PCR portal add-in because that version that version of our book it won't allow it to get me to you yeah okay you should be all set you know how now you have like your PC recruiter ribbon and all that you didn't have that before with the other app right okay so So now I want to see – I never use this. That's why I'm having problems navigating here. So – These should be the same emails that you had in your other app. Yeah. The one from you we're talking about now, is that right? Well, they should be all the same emails in general. You're just using a different app to work with them. The other app was like the Outlook New. This is what's called Outlook Classic. Right. And now I want to go and see name. Okay. Or I guess my PCR. I should be able to see. Okay. So if you're trying to work off something from something that was emailed to you, you have to be in this app. Yeah, so I'm in the right app now, right? Right. So I'm going to go to my contact name or go to company. I'm going to say off it. Okay, so I'm going to... No, that's not it. So I went to two people, Jim Erico. Okay, so that happened. But this shows me it was last modified in 2017. That's when a field data, like if you went into a field and made a change and then hit save. Right. Which is different than like last activity. Okay. Is there a way to see my last activity? You have to go to activities from their name record. So that's the last thing there. Yeah. So you can customize your layout to include the last activity date. So what was a specific action that you couldn't do before? Well, I wanted, I thought I created, I went to this guy's record. And I hit download the card, the V card. Can you show me that? Can you show me that? Because if you did. Yeah, I'll try. I just want to go to the web. I'll try this. I'm sorry I've had a bunch of medical stuff lately and I'm not too sharp today how can I get back to you I've got to recreate this And then I'd like to check back with you. Can you call me back in like a half hour? Yeah, or just call into support at Main Sequel. Just call back into us because I don't know if I would be available, but at least somebody would be. But you can give me a try. My extension is 5466. Okay. Okay, but just make sure you're using – yeah, just make sure if you're doing like – if you have something like in your contacts, in your Outlook, and you're trying to sync it over to your database, just make sure you are in this app because your new version will not recognize it. Right, right. Got that. Okay. Okay, good. Thanks very much. You are welcome. No problem. Okay. Have a great week. Bye-bye. Bye. You too.",
