    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good morning. Chris, how are you? I'm doing well, brother. How are you? I'm all right. I'm all right. Yes, I wanted to, today, I think we were going to take a look at the AI suite. Can I talk a little bit about that? Yeah, man, just give me the rundown. I want to see if it's something that we can utilize. I guess I could have done my own research, but it's always more efficient for somebody that knows what the hell they're doing to tell you what the hell it does. Sure, I'll share my screen and kind of show you a little bit around what it does as well. So let me share that there. Get into my database here. So the AI Suite, what it does, have you seen it in your database yet? Because it's on there as kind of a trial for the summer. They've kind of enabled it. So where would I see it, I guess? Well, you see my screen, okay. what you'd be able to do any name record for example one click you'll see it is on the summary button or on the summary tab it's going to be this AI generator at the far right hand and that little icon it's like a purplish bluish PC recruiter icon so that icon so you'll see that on an email send screen candidate summary job description so there's a few different places you'd see it in the system there. I'm not seeing that. So I'm in edit name. And if you go to summary, if you go to any candidates record, go to summary. At the end of that long string of different controls, there should be that little AI suite, that little AI generator there. Okay, so summary is not pinned for me. Let me pin that. It may not be because it's not usually widely used up until now. That's why they put the AI generator there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So bam, summary. And when I pin this for one person, it's going to pin it for everybody, right? Nope, just for you. Okay. No, no, no, no. What I mean is if I pin it, let's say, for example, I went to a guy named Tony. I went to summary. I pinned it to my task bar, basically, edit name, resume, interviews, activity, rollup, et cetera. Now that I've pinned it on him, it's going to pin it across all databases, across all of my names in my database. No, not unless you copy it. You can copy your user settings to all the other users, but it won't by default. Because that way it gives you the ability to kind of customize or personalize it if you wish. But anyone can do that if they wish. So if you're on that summary, do you see that little icon at the end of the line? Yep, and I'm in it. Okay, yeah. So what that will do, so it is on a trial basis right now. It does require you to do a premium upgrade because it really requires the premium package to run fully. So we can talk about that afterwards once I show you kind of what it does. But if you click that button, what it's going to do is I click it. It's going to take into account in this case, it will take into account the person's resume and all their field data and it's going to generate a summary. So it's going to generate a little bit of a candidate summary for them based on the info you have on them. And then if you save that summary, you can keep that in the summary area. It's going to be searchable data and it's also going to be something that you can search on. Maybe you want to email it out to someone or share it as part of a candidate presentation too. So it just generates a candidate description or a little summary. You can hit it again. It'll regenerate. So maybe it'll pull it into bullet points or something like that. So it kind of regenerates a little bit as you want. Okay. So that's one of the content generators. The other one, very similar, just a little bit different use on every position in the job description field. there is now going to be an AI button like that. So if you click that, that will generate a job description. Taking into account the details in the field, the details of the company, so it will generate a job description. So a job description generator is the second piece of that. The third piece is going to be an email generator. So if you're in PC Recruiter, anywhere you would go to send an email. So I'm just going to go to a record, go to an email send screen. You're going to see that same icon at the top. And if you click that icon, it pops up a new pop-up screen and it's going to give you a little bit, this one's a little bit more involved because you can say how you want your email to sound. Maybe I want formal. Maybe it's going to be a follow-up. Then it's going to generate an email. And then maybe you respond. I mentioned the interview last week. So I can add something in there, kind of add to it. It'll regenerate. And I think you can do it six or eight times. add qualifiers or by the ways or hey add this mention this anything like that so it's going to kind of generate some email content and then you can hit the regenerate button maybe you hit the use this text that'll actually load it right into the email button in the email box so i've played with a handful of of ai generated texts and it all kind of regurgitates nothing if that makes sense. I use a lot of words, but it says a lot of nothing. I called AI-generated text politicians. And you almost can tell when you get it from someone, you almost can tell, oh, that was AI-generated, I think. Without a doubt. Yeah, but it helps people. Some people like it. It helps them a little bit. So my question is, what has PCR done to kind of make it to where it actually has substance in the email? where it's not like it's so generated that it's easy to tell, hey, this guy just sent me this. Because when you start sending impersonal stuff like that, it can backfire. It can read wrong. For sure, for sure. Well, I think nothing we've done, but I've heard what people say is have it mention specific things or specific following up on that interview to see if you wanted to meet again next week or something a little more personal. in the prompts you give it that should make it a little less AIE, if you will. But I think since we're using basically the ChatGPC technology, it's all going to kind of start to look the same eventually unless you kind of go and be a little more specific in your prompt with what you're asking. Does it remember prompts? Does it save the way that you like? Let's say there's a certain way that I'm obviously leaning towards the way I want the emails to read. Does it remember that and populate my emails in the future on, say, the first or second try more similar to what I've accepted in the past or not? Or do you know? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know for sure, but I don't believe so. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, I don't believe it does. It'll do that. And then the fourth part is going to be a search, which is my least favorite part. I like a Boolean search. But if you go up into here, you can hit this AI slider, and it'll give you some different AI searching capabilities. So you can kind of do like, what interviews do I have today? Or what calls did I miss today? Or who lives in Cleveland, Ohio? So you can kind of throw in any of these prompts. Or you can type your own. You can type like, show me names in Ohio or something like that. When you do your search, it's going to return a group of people there. And this is especially helpful like, who has this phone number? Or who's call that I missed yesterday? Something like that. it's not helpful if you're looking for something very specific like boolean searching this isn't going to be for you but this is a nice way to kind of find people quickly just a quick conversational search it'll find your results here you can click in any one of them another drawback to this you can't right now do anything with these results so you can't select them all and put them on a roll-up list or send them an email right from here or anything like that that's being worked on well that's to be improved for a few yeah that's why I don't like this the this search it's good for finding someone if you want to open up their record but it's not good for if you wanted to save the people or do anything with them so this is in a constant state of improvement but along these lines something else that's coming out in a few weeks that's going to be part of the AI search is a auto match feature so you can go into a job there's going to be a button that you can click to find the best 15 candidates or so in in your database that match that job. So you can just click a button, it'll return using the information about the job, it'll return the best 15 or so matches of people within your database. So that's kind of a nice piece that is coming out. I don't have it because it's still in development, but that should be coming out soon, and they're improving this search piece there. Yeah, okay. Okay, so talk to me about money. Yeah, so what it is. So in order to get the premium package, you would need to upgrade to the premium, or in order to get the AI suite, you'd need to upgrade to the premium package of PC Recruiter. The premium package is going to include not only the AI suite, but also the analytics dashboard, the email campaigns piece, and the sequences. So it upgrades you to a whole other package. It is an additional $20 per user per month, so $20 more than you're paying now per user, and then it's $500 set up one time. That includes the installation and setup of all these new features and six hours training on the use and setup of them. So you would also gain like your analytics, which you currently don't have. So I could build custom reports. I could look at like a pipeline activity and I could see all my interview reports. Or maybe I want BizDev and I look at all my activity types that are relating to business development or something like that. And you'd also have the email campaigns, which is the ability to send out a bulk email. but in this version you also have the ability to look at a report and see open rates click rates I can even see who clicked on what and how many times so I can easily toggle through that information there and then you also have the sequencing piece which is going to let you build custom drift campaigns so you can set it up so that on this roll-up list the very first step is going to be an email sent and then what the recipient does with that email will kind of figure out what the next step is going to be. So if they open it, maybe it'll add them to a call list. If they don't open it in three days, maybe it sends a secondary email, or maybe it'll send a text through RingCentral or something like that. So you get all those features and the AI that'll upgrade you to the Premium Plus package. So $500 one time, $20 user month, it adds all that. So quick question, how many users do we have right now? I think I was showing five. I think let me just confirm that. Follow up in here. I have you commercial financial consultants. That's the company name? Yes. The database is David Rains. Or the main name on the database is David Rains. Yeah. I have you listed as five users at $50 per month. Okay. so we might need to adjust that i guess i have to talk to somebody else about because we don't have five users i mean i got we have we have an admin and then we have two main users and there's really no sense so i guess my question is if i take off a couple users and then i add bodies later, am I paying a new price or am I paying my old price? Because we've been grandfathered in, we've been with you guys for 20 years. So what does that look like exactly? Well, if you were, so you can get adjusted at any time. So it looks like there's only one, two, three, four users accessing it regularly. One is admin, which is non-billable. and that doesn't include D-Rains. So if you're including him, there's only four actives using it. So you can add or drop users anytime. So if you drop down to four users today, I could put in a ticket, drop you down to the four, and if you add additional users, they would still be the same price whatever you're at. So that doesn't reset that at all. If you upgrade it, obviously that price would be 20 bucks more, but it would still be at that if you add a drop to whatever, you have the flexibility to be able to go up and down in your user account as needed. Got it. Who's the main users right now? Main users that I'm showing are CRanes, ACCT1, EXASST, and then DRanes is also in there, but he hasn't logged in under DRanes since 3.19. So it's been since March of 2024. So that hasn't used in quite a while. So it looks like there's really only four users, CRanes, ACCT1, EXASST, and admin, but admin is non-billable. So you're actually three billable users. Okay. All right. We can drop DRanes. That's my father. He passed away in 2020. and any I don't know if you guys need corporate docs or anything of that nature but it's just me. I'm the one running the show now. So any legal docs that you guys have that show ownership or representation or whatever, that can be moved to me for obvious reasons. It might not be a bad idea to get a new contract signed. I'd keep the same rate because we still have your father listed as the signer from 2010. So it probably wouldn't hurt to get a new agreement. Yeah, if we need to do that, that's fine. Yeah, it works. We pay the bills. We haven't really worried about the administrative nonsense of it just because there's never been an issue, so if it's not broken, don't fix it. But just for a go-forward basis, It's probably intelligent to go ahead and execute something. But I do want to drop him as a user and then add the premium across the interface. At $20 a month, that's inexpensive enough that I'm okay with that. Okay, so what we'll do, we'll do it in one fell swoop. I'll send over a new agreement for only three users. Is that reasonable? I have yet five now, but it looks like there's only three using. So we could drop it to three users, but do the upgrade. Three plus admin. Yeah, and the admin's no charge. So three users plus admin. Because as long as the admin's not being used every day regularly, which it doesn't look like it is. No, we only do that for like deleting records and stuff that's protected. Yeah, so we'll do three users on the premium. We'll make you the new signer. We'll keep it the same, obviously 50 plus 20. so you're still 70 but this is 115 to 125 is the list price so you have a great deal on that. And just to confirm, I have your address. Is it still 20 Noble Court Suite 200? No, not even close. That probably hasn't been updated in a while. So what's the address and all that? The new address is 2500 Discovery Boulevard, Suite 300, Rockwall, Texas, Okay. Rockwall, Texas, 75032. 75032. Okay. I've got that. And I have, let's see, I still have ABL Factoring, Inc., and then I have Commercial Finance Consultants, CFC. What is the appropriate company name? It's not ABL or anything, is it? Not anymore? ABL Factoring Inc. is our legal name. Commercial Finance Consultants slash CFC for short is our DBA. So whatever is the most applicable for your records, that's the full, everything is still legal, tendered, ABL Factoring Inc. and it's CFC. So awesome. So that is good. So I'll update that. I'll make it just DBA. So we've got that. Okay. So what I'll do now that I've got that all updated, let me email you over the new paperwork. I'll get that over to you today for only three users. So you're actually going to notice instead of 250, you're going to be 70 times three, you're going to be 210. So actually for the upgrade, you're actually going down a little bit because you adjusted your users. so you'll notice a cheaper monthly rate just the one-time 500 but a cheaper monthly rate from here forward and then I'll go ahead and get everything the installs and the trainings and everything in there we'll get you is the list of signer owner and everything there so last question the the D rain deal he he was the admin and he had emails and all that none of that stuff's being utilized anymore what happens to his inbox and all that stuff it's no longer accessible at all or it would be accessible if you knew the username and password to get in under his username it's still there uh and anything he ever entered or activities in the database those are all still going to be there and you'd see those right as other users too but yeah if you needed to get in you just need to know the username password to get into his username to get there okay but it's It's not active. You can't do anything. The dialer doesn't work. None of that is active. Yeah, that wouldn't be working anymore. Okay. Okay, great. Very well. Very well. Well, I'll get that over to you later today. And then if you have questions, let me know. I'll check in a couple of days if I haven't heard anything back. Sounds like a plan. So how soon will we do the $500 charge and then subsequently the six-hour training? And is the six hours all at once? Because that's a lot. six hours is hourly long hourly sessions so what would happen is I'll send the paperwork when you sign it you can have an invoice sent over for the 500 that's usually what they'll do though usually as soon as it's signed they'll send an invoice over you can click to pay that online whenever you're ready and as soon as that's paid we'll get the ticket in for the setup and then once everything's installed then the trainer will reach out to get some training underway and schedule that according to your your availability. Perfecto. Thank you so much Jim. Very well very well I'll go ahead and send that a little bit and like I said any questions give me a call I'll touch base in a couple days if we don't have to reconnected by that. Sounds like a plan thanks so much have yourself a fantastic day. You as well Chris thank you much. All right bye now. Bye bye.",
