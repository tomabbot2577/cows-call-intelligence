    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I was hoping that you could help me. I am a new user on PCR and Outlook, and I need some help getting my PCR and my Outlook connected. Okay. No problem. What's your name and what company are you with? My name is Dawn. Last name is Conwell, C-O-N-W-E-L-L. The company is TransDirectUSA. Oh, there we go. Perfect. All right. So let's jump on a screen share that way. You better see what your outlook setup is. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. OK, one second. I got like so many screens open. So in my browser, go meetings. Yep, meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, so let's join the meeting. Perfect. And it'll probably ask you for a meeting ID. Right. Okay, that's 837-889-580. It's amazing that you guys can do this. It says join audio or continue with audio. I guess it doesn't matter, huh? I guess continue without audio since we're already on the phone. That'll work. And then just click that blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. I have two screens open. I guess just choose one and we could drag anything over to that screen if it's not on the right one. Okay. Perfect. I can see that. I can see the screen that has RingCentral pulled up. Perfect. All right. So first off, we need to make sure that you have Outlook Classic installed on your computer. Outlook New is not compatible with our portal add-in. So to check that, go to that search bar down at the bottom. Okay, yeah, so this is outlook new, but you still might have outlook classic just look for outlook in that search bar there Classic yeah, there we go. Go ahead and open up outlook classic While we're waiting on this, do you remember at any point installing Java or the PCR Launcher? Those are two programs that kind of run in the background. You know what? I had been with this company back in March, and I just came back, and I had to bring my computer over to my boss's house and drop it off because I am so bad at this stuff. Okay, cool. yeah let's getting it ready to go she did everything on it Garrett so I'm not really sure not a problem we could do a quick test to make sure that those are installed if you want to well okay this is ready now is that the correct email account? Yes, it is. Okay, go ahead and hit connect. Okay, and then uncheck the box that says set up Outlook mobile on my phone too and just hit done. Okay, we'll let that load for a second there. Okay. All right, go ahead and minimize Outlook that we just opened here and open up PC Recruiter. You have that in a tab up top there in your browser all the way at the top left. Yeah, I got you stuck there though, so. Okay, there we go. Oh, I'm sorry. I was going to leave. Okay. Perfect. So then click on the lightning bolt at the top right and select name. And then click parse from resume. And then start at the bottom right. We should see a window pop up here if you have a Java and Launcher installed. If nothing's popping up, looks like we're still going to need, yeah, it would have popped up by now. So let's work on getting Java and Launcher installed on your computer. Go ahead and close this pop up. open a new tab in your browser I got you up there can I move that okay there you go yep and then go to java.com j-a-v-a calm perfect click on download Java for desktops towards the bottom there again Yeah, I clicked that again. Perfect. And that'll start a download at the top right of your browser. When that completes, there you go. Just click on that file listed in the little window that popped up. Click on the, at the top right of your browser, there's a down arrow in blue. Click on that. And then click on JRE to open that file. So, and it may ask if you want to make changes. You could say yes to that. Okay, hit install. It's amazing how you guys can do this just off the top of your head. Crazy to me. now yeah we get um a lot of similar questions throughout the day i know but your knowledge is a little bit oh yeah to me no yeah it's it's it's just a handful of things that i know how to do um because of frequency but i'm not really that smart it's just kind of i don't i don't believe you care right gotcha that looks like it went through oh wait yeah go ahead and click on that to read that update versions installed okay yeah go ahead and click uninstall on that one and it'll give you the latest version okay next next perfect and close. Okay, that's in good shape. That's the first part. You can close this browser tab, the download Java browser tab that you have open. We'll go back here, and then let's get to your PCR login screen. So you can log out of PCR. Okay, but, oh, there you go. And before you login at the bottom left it says launcher install click on Windows that logo there at the far bottom oh sorry yeah okay so when those perfect and same thing when that download completes at the top right just open that file PC recruiter launcher perfect yes yes hit yes on that and next check the I accept terms and hit next and typical we want that one towards the top there and install awesome hit finish on that and finally we'll make sure that we have the Outlook portal go ahead and log in on this you might see a pop-up appear if you log in there we go check the box that says always allow on that white pop-up there and then open control loader and this will prompt us if we need to get an even later version there we go hit allow on that it'll give us an even later version of what we just installed. Excellent. Okay, that's great. So last piece then, in a new tab in the browser, go to our home page which is pcrecruiter.net. Perfect, go ahead and click on that. Yep. And there's a little drop down at the top right that says technical info. Under that, there's a downloads option. Yeah, perfect. Downloads. All right. Scroll down a little bit on the left. We're going to see Microsoft Outlook. There we go. It's the second one. PC Recruiter for Microsoft Outlook. Here? Download in green. Yep. Perfect. And that one takes just a little bit longer, but once that's done, we'll open that. In the meantime, go ahead and open up your Outlook new. There's two Outlook programs down on your taskbar. That rounded looking one, that's the new one. Go ahead and close that for now. this one keep and close this one right yeah exactly and keep this one okay yeah and what we'll do is I just want to make sure my oh yeah see if that's all yeah I just want to make sure I made an appointment just before I called you wanted to make sure it was there but it's there oh it's good okay good yeah then right click on the outlook new icon down at the bottom just right click on it in that taskbar again and we can unpin it. Where do you want me to go? So on the taskbar at the bottom center of your screen where it has the Outlook new, the one that we closed, if you right click on that, yeah if you right click on that it should let you you unpin yeah that way you'll have a classic one yeah gotcha okay and let's go back to Google Chrome we'll see if the download is getting close to being completed there yeah okay still working on it I appreciate this I was sending out all these emails yesterday through PCR nobody was getting them and I couldn't see your own Oh, okay. You know? Here we go. Okay, go ahead and open that file, pcrportal.exe. And that's a yes? Yes. That's good. And next. And accept and next. Next again. and install. Okay, go ahead and click finish and we can close Outlook and reopen it to have that show up in there. So close, yeah go ahead and open up that Outlook down below and then close the program at the top right. Perfect. And we'll reopen it. It looks like we'll need to pin the old one on here. I was going to say, where did it go? I will panic. Right there? Yeah, you could right-click on that icon down there, and there'll probably be an option to pin it. Oh, serial number. Let me look that up for you while that pops up there. And then pin to taskbar, correct? There you go. Yep. All right. And you said we were with TransDirectUSA. I'll get you that serial number right now. It's a long number here. It's 138-765-231-308-551. Is that okay on that? Yep. All right, now we'll get you signed in. So click on add connection at the top left of that pop-up window. And this needs your PCR web address. So if you just want to go back to Google Chrome where you have PCR open, we could copy the full web address there. I think I saw it there. Yeah, if you hover over that Google Chrome icon again at the bottom of your screen there was a couple ones to choose from there on the far left. Okay, but I have the WWPCR. Oh you got it. And then perfect. Yeah, is that is that correct? Perfect. Click on go. Okay. Okay. And then it can prompt you to put in your username and password, hopefully, here. I don't have my password already, though. Oh, it's greenfield2025. Okay, I think. Okay, use that drop-down there where it says database and select your database right in the center. There you go. Transdirect USA, perfect. And put in your username and password. My email address is on. Usually it's not an email address. It's just like a username. I can look that up for you. I was going to say, because I think the only sign-in I have for that is... is my email. And then I... Let me try the list here. So there's a user. Don C is the username. Okay. And the password, I believe, is Greenfield. I don't have access to the passwords, but hopefully it works. We'll see. Yeah, it says it's not right. Okay. It is case sensitive. Oh it is. Why is that? Because this would be lowercase than right. John? How can that be all caps at all? The username is going to be always in all caps, but the password is case sensitive. So it might be the password. Greenfield, Here we go. Excellent. This I would hit no on for now. The pop-up there. We don't want to put those two together? That's up to you. Later we can make it so that it only syncs one way, or if you want it syncing both ways, that's up to you. to you no I just I just want to make sure that my emails go through with PCI okay that's fine so yeah no okay and then on the next pop-up hit yes there we go and then enter your password one more time down at the bottom there where it says password There'll be a remember my password button a little bit higher up there. And kind of above your username, it's like a little checkbox that says remember. Oh, there we go. Okay. Yep. And then hit test connection up at the top left. Oh, here it is. okay excellent hit okay and save and close all right and then we'll need to do one more oh yeah check that box that says always allow on that pop-up and hit open you can check the box that says do not show this guide in the future bottom left and then hit get purchase okay yeah all right and one last change we'll need to make go to file in the main menu at the top left there then go to options at the bottom left oh I got to get you out of the way there and then right in the middle there's two radio buttons one says optimized for best appearance and and the other one says optimize for compatibility. We want the optimize for compatibility selected instead, and then hit okay at the bottom right. Excellent. All right, so you should be all set up. You can use PCR inside of Outlook, and when you send and receive emails through Outlook, you'll be able to, it'll be automatically recording the activities on the records. Okay. And then let's check one more thing because you mentioned that if you're in the browser, you're not able to send emails. We'll just see if that version of your browser version of PCR is working correctly. So go back to Google Chrome and open up PCRecruiter. What's on the other – over here. Oh, there we go. And then go to System in the main menu at the top center. Perfect. And Email Setup on the left. And Email Alias List to the right of that. All right. In the bottom frame, click the pencil icon to edit that alias. And it looks like you have an office connection. Click on Sign In with Microsoft, the black button there. And go ahead and sign in to your email address. Uh-oh. Password's correct. The X at the top right there to close that pop-up that just appeared. And then, password is incorrect. Because it just showed it, and it is correct. It looks like it, yeah, that's an incorrect password for this email account. Oh, yeah. Well, for Dawn C., let me try this. I thought she changed it. Oh, it's Wabatosa. That's my old one. Okay, so. go ahead and hit accept down at the bottom there and you could close that pop-up saying save password oh that already happened that's good and then down at the bottom just hit test connection cool go ahead and close that test and hit save so you're all set up you can send email in PCR in the browser or you can utilize Outlook. Either way all the activities will be written on the records. Oh thank you so much Garrett I appreciate your time. No problem reach out if you need anything else. I sure will. Thanks again. Thanks.
