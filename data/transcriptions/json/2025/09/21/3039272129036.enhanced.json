    "text": " Thank you. quick search, some information on that. We are giving that as a free trial this summer. So it is available in the database, and it looks like it was turned on for you by Garrett. And it looks like he sent the information on the first, or let me see what it looks like he sent. I just had your account here opened. And it looks as though he sent the information you were waiting for. Let me just take a quick look because I got your voice mail from a few days back. He sent it on 8-1, so it looks like he sent it on Friday. I wanted to make sure you had that. See if you have any other questions concerning PC Recruiter or the Quick Search or anything like that, the AI Search. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Please give me a call if there's anything else I can do. Thanks, Elizabeth. Take care. Bye-bye.",
