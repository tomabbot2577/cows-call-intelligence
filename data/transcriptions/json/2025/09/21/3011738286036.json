    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Scott Samuels, Horizon Hospitality. I'm having an issue and I'm not sure why, but can you log in into my PCR and I'll show you what I'm doing? Sure. Do you want to be on a screen share? Or I could just log in to your database. We could do that. Okay. Let me fire up a meeting here. One second. All right. So in a new tab in your browser, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. And the ID is 704-322-164. Elon? Okay, I see you joined there. You can hit mute at the bottom left so there's no echo, and then just go to the blue share button at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. Perfect. Can you see this? Yes. Okay. Okay, so I tried to create what we're trying to do here is I want to make sure that people are managing our clients and the repeat clients that we have. So I put together a custom name report and selected these tabs, right? I couldn't get it to pull activities, the last activity other than the date. Okay. Right. And because I wanted it to show up on this report, but for whatever reason, that's not a field I could select or I could get that, the specifics of the last activity. Right, yeah. gave me the date so I had I copied in the last activity that happened into Quick Notes and added that as a on the report okay because because it takes it took me very little time to do that just copy paste but I put it into Quick Note and use that as a field that I could capture gotcha so so everything was fine up until I printed this report and I showed that the last activity dates were all changed based on when I added the quick note right and it screwed everything up because the last activities aren't on the 10th but that's when I made that change oh I see so then I went back in and I deleted that last activity that I was part of but it still didn't change the last activity I go back to the name record and that last activity is no longer there but it prints up that it is so I don't know what I could do to let's see maybe you can go to your recycling bin and clear that activity from the recycling bin that might help. You think? I mean, the activities date is no longer in under, like, this first one, Windows Catering Company. You know, if I go to – can you see the whole screen? Yeah. Because I just got this new – all right, I just got this new monitor. Okay, so Brian Acuna. Okay, so I go to Brian's name, right? And then I go to activities. And so, well, that's not a good example. But I guess it is an okay example because this should be the last activity time at 714, but it's showing my time. 5.51 p.m. Yeah. I mean, that wasn't a good example because she actually had something, but it would have been my name. Like, if I go into – I'll go into Lixie just to show you. Lixie. I thought that – So, like, this was 425, right? But it's still showing 710. How did that happen? Yeah, let's try deleting those activities from the recycling bin. Maybe that'll help. I'm not exactly sure where the reports point from. All right. Where do I do that? So go to System in the main menu up at the top. Then go to – use that little search bar on the left to look for recycling bin. Perfect. Perfect. And then use that filter at the top of the type column and grab name activity as the type and then use the date range and probably the user filters as well so we're looking at July good and then yeah you can sleep there and then the user name your name and so that's about 49 those all the right ones okay and then delete those And once those delete, we can try running the report again. Does it take a while? Well, it's just 49. It shouldn't really take a while. Let me click it again. Okay. Go ahead and close out of this pop-up, and we'll see if those are still there. So if you go back to your recycling bin. Yeah, those are all still there, it looks like. um interesting all results leave permanently and i'll check yeah just let it sit for a second i'll check on your permissions make sure everything looks good there are you in the horizon healthcare or horizon hospitality Horizon hospitality. I mean, I should have admin permissions to be able to do all this stuff. Yeah, I'll double check that right now. Yeah, you have full administrator permissions. That's good. Okay, well, it's not deleting. It's weird. I just tried one. It's not even letting me delete one. Yeah, something's off there. I'm not seeing anything in the permissions that would prevent you from deleting something out of the recycling bin. I can actually, I guess I can have the tech team delete it and then I'll let them know that you're having an issue using your recycling bin to permanently delete files. Yeah, I mean, could you see if they could, I'm trying to get this done. Do you think that's something they could do this morning? I have no idea. I don't really know what their current workload is, but I'll talk to them right after we get off the phone and let them know. Okay. All right. I appreciate it. And if you could shoot me an email or give me a call back and let me know, that would be great. Absolutely. I have Scott at HorizonHospitality.com. Is that the best email? Yep. That's it. All right. And then your report you're running is called the Repeat Client Report. Okay. Right. It's a custom name report. Yeah, and I guess I would ask you, you know, to capture this last activity, the specifics versus having to create this quick note, is there any way to do that or is that something that you'd have to create a custom report for us? I think we would have to create a custom report because that last activity field is just a date, you know, kind of across the board in PCR. Okay. And is there any note field that has the ability to capture more information? Because Quick Note has a limit on the capacity of what it will take. Because if I put that last activity into another field, like I tried to do it under notes and notes wouldn't show up. Name notes. It's like a field that you can put into your report, right? Right, yeah. Okay, gotcha. Yeah, I'll look into that. There might be on just fields in general, I know that there's a 255-character limit for most fields in PCR. Okay, well, maybe that's the issue. Okay. Well, let me know about this deletion. That would be great, and I appreciate your help. Yep. No problem. I'll get back to you soon. All right. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye.",
