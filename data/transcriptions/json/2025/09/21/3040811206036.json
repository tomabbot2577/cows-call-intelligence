    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi. Can you help me out with something on tech support? I could sure try to. What is your name? Okay. I'm on my Apple laptop, and I'm in PCR, and I'm trying to open up an attachment, but I can't open it from like 10 years ago. okay um what is your name is this like a new different computer that you don't normally use or no no it's just um can you open other attachments yeah like i can open a resume but it's it's more of like the um like it's in the company and it's like a fee agreement that's any attachments. I've had this problem like a few times in the past where I have to download an Adobe something because I'm on an Apple, not a Microsoft computer. Yeah, I was wondering if you had like the Amazon Coreto link installed like the PC URL. Can you do a screen share with me? Yes. Okay. And what is your name, please? it's joe or joseph lucas l-u-c-a-s and the company search max inc okay here's my one second here i've got way too many things open yeah it's just going to get confusing here we go is your email joe at mri search max.com yes yes okay all right i'm going to send you an invite through google meet Okay, I sent you a meeting, a Google Meet invite. Okay. All right, so I'm going to have you, Joe. And you can, like, mute the microphone since you're already on the phone. Otherwise, it causes a lot of background interference. Okay, I'm going to have you click the share screen option at the bottom of the meeting screen, but then go over to where it says entire screen. And then under entire screen, in case you have more than one monitor, make sure you pick which screen to show me and then click share. It says open system settings. Yeah, that's your Mac preferences. And it might kick you out of the meeting for a moment. Yeah, you're going to have to go over that system preferences and then give permission for Google Chrome. Yeah. yes Okay, it made you leave the meeting just max do that just click the link again for my invite Should I put you back in? Okay. Go back to the share screen option. Okay. Let's open up a new tab and have you go over to PC Recruiter. I'd like to check something here. There is an application. Open URL. Okay. Okay, hit cancel here. And do me one favor. Can you go up at the top right where you have like the quick add option where is that a top rated piece recruiter okay I mean there we go click on that the quick editor lightning the lightning bolt option go to name and then select parse from resume because this tells me if it's just the Amazon Coreto and Peace Recruiter Launchpad. Go ahead. Yep, hit start for me. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's cancel out of here. And then I'm going to have you close that. And then let's close. Or you can just reuse this tab. Go to the top where you have the URL and replace that. We're going to do a search for Amazon Coreto 8. How do you spell Coretto? C-O-R. I can't remember. It's two R's. Oh, here it is. Coretto. No, go back and do that again. Or put the number 8 after that. Amazon Coretto 8. Okay, click that. downloads for Amazon Coreto 8 and then within that table go down like a little bit I think it's going to be past the Windows 64 where it says Mac OS 64 click on the link that ends in jdk.pkg click on that one right there Okay, go ahead and open that file. And click install. here There's a way to that. You should get this all done in September. That's the next challenge. They have submitted to their regulators to see if the wide-ranging people in this state are concerned about the data that was taken. If they get it, the regulators say, yeah, we do a way that you can charge. That's the challenge that we've taken to that point. We're with NASA. And we're going to do it. Okay. Hit close. And then you can move that to trash. You can just move it to trash. That was the install file. Okay, now I'm going to have you go back to your Chrome. Okay, let's go using this tab. Let's just go back to your login page for Peace Recruiter, but don't log in yet. Okay, see at the very bottom left where it says Launcher Installed, and there's an icon for Windows and Mac. Click where it says Mac. Okay, and then drop that file from PCR URL drop it into the applications folder Okay, usually get like some kind of confirmation not getting any kind of confirmation Can I replace it? Yeah, hit replace. Okay, let's have you then close this window. Let's go to your PCR login screen, but we might get some extra prompts this first time we go in. So let's hit login. Open it. Is it prompting you to, is it prompting anything? It says, is an app downloaded from the internet? Are you sure you want to open it? Are you sharing your entire screen? I'm not seeing that. Yes. Is there like a checkbox to say like always allow or anything like that when you were doing that? Hold on. Let me just get out of this. It just took me back into here again. Okay. Go back over to a file and see if you can open the attachment now. I couldn't see the prompts that I normally would see, so I'm just a little concerned there. Okay. Now, how do I, like, it's worked like this in the past, so... Yeah, I don't know. Did you do some computer resets or something like that? I'm not sure, but is there any way, is there any way if I do do an upgrade and I lose it again in the future, can you email me the instructions of what you just sent me? Because it's pretty simple. Yeah, absolutely. I will get that over to you in just a moment. Yeah, this is it right here. This is perfect. I really appreciate your help. No problem. Have a good week. Thank you. Bye. You're welcome. Bye.",
