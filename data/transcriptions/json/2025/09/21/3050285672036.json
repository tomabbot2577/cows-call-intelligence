    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Alex Meyer. Quick question. I was cleaning out my email box and see that I had missed an email announcement about, like, the new AI component for the search queries. Mm-hmm. And it said it automatically should be updated and in there, but I don't see that. You know, there's supposed to be, like, a little toggle in the quick search, and I don't see it. So I'm not sure if I need to do something or update something or something. Yes. So for some databases, the AI part of the search wasn't activated for everybody right away, just because a certain back-end database search upgrade is needed for it to function properly. I'm just popping into your database here to see what... I take off most of the summer, and so maybe they looked at the total lack of recent activity in the database, and maybe that was one of the reasons why they didn't activate it. No, it just wasn't activated for anybody. People had to request that part be activated. Oh, okay. And it looks you're on Lucene already, which is good. So what I'm going to do... I don't know how much I'll use it anyway but you know I yeah pretty intriguing yeah you can do natural word queries instead of having to you know I do a lot of like radius queries and if it kind of automates like you know I don't know what what commercial lenders are within 50 miles of you know Vermont Illinois would be something if you could type it in natural word instead of having to build the query through the advanced search that'd be kind of neat Yep. Yeah. So what I'll be able to do is just activate it here for you, put it in your database. And then I just got to create a ticket for you. Just saying that AI search activation was done. So you'll get an email about that. And also what I'll do, I'll just do it while we're on the phone here. I have one question when you're done, but I'll let you finish typing. All right. So if you log out and back into PC Recruiter, you'll be able to see that AI search toggle now. Okay, cool. And then one question about it. So like on the candidate side, does it – like one of the things that would be useful because I don't have a field that – Well, for one, I'm terrible at taking notes. For two, I don't have a field that has, like, years of experience on the candidate side. Obviously, I have it on the job order side. And so will it scan, like, if it has a candidate who has a resume in the database, will it look at the resume? No, it won't be able to do anything like that. Oh, okay. Okay. I was just curious so that you know that. That would be kind of cool, though. Yeah, you know what I mean? Because there's not like a years of experience field by default in the system, so if I have a candidate in there, I could make a manual field that says years of experience. But the problem is that unless you update every candidate, it's not going to be current anyway unless you update every candidate on a fairly regular basis. But okay, that'll work. Well, no, I'll play with it and see what it does. Because if nothing else, it'll build like, like I said, if you do like instead of having to go into the advanced search and do a radius, that was one of the examples I think they gave was, you know, what to say, hey, can I look at every candidate that's within 30 miles of such and such location? And rather than having to look up the zip code and all that, it'll do that automated, I would assume. I believe so. Well, in that email that you got, there's a video that shows its capability, and it has the limitations of the AI search as it currently is. Oh, okay, cool. So that's different than the initial video that was in the email, just kind of announcing it? Yeah. So we have it in our learning center. There should be a link in that email that takes you there. It has the search limitations listed. Okay, very good. All right, well, that is all I need. I don't have an email yet, but it may take a minute. Yeah, I'm creating the ticket now. And then I'll put a link in. Here, I'll actually just grab this for you real quick because you'll get the – is the – N-E-E or – Yeah, neexecrecruit at Outlook.com. Well, I'm not sure if you have – which one do you have? I think they have that one not the Alex at Meyer executive search comm for you guys, which is fine That's all that Outlook one is it's better just because it makes it easier when I'm Traveling to that outlook one. I don't have to worry about Changing around yep, so I'm just putting that in the ticket here as well cool So you should get that email anytime now, okay and there's the AI feature. Okay, so this is the one that's got the video, I assume. It's pulling up. I don't know if it's taking a second, but I've got the email if that first link was the one that will take me to the video AI features. Okay, very good. I will take a look at that and see what it does. That's perfect. alrighty and then if you have any questions just let us know and then is it how long does it take to activate should I wait an hour and log it out and back in or you can log in and out right now oh okay cool alrighty there I will do that alrighty well you have yourself a great rest of the day and like I said if you need anything else just let us know that sounds great thank you so much have a good one you bet",
