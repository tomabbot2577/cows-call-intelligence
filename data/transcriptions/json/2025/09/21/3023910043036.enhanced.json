    "text": " Thank you for calling me in Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Is it Gary, right? What's your name again? Garrett, yep. Okay, so I have a query, Gary. I'm using PCR right now, but there's a company I'm working with. And what we are trying to do is we want to give them an API key for our database. So is it possible from PCR? Oh, so we aren't using API keys or app IDs anymore. You can just use username, password, and database ID. Let me email you our API documentation. Definitely, because, exactly. Because as much as I remember previously, like last year, I was working with PCR only. and back then there was an option to share my API key for a specific roll-up list but I'm not sure I'm not able to do it now so is it not available now anymore? Right yeah we used to partner with a company called 3scale we had a 3scale website that would hold API keys and app IDs but we did away with that so that it's more of an open API and we're just using database ID specifically as a way to connect. And I can show you where to find the database ID if you need that specifically for anything. So my goal is like usually what happens is we are working with a team who usually help us with sourcing and all. So I just want to give them my data, my roll-up list, specific roll-up list. and what they're asking me for is they're asking if I can provide them the API key for like information tool and all. So will this option that you are saying, this, what were you saying about a rollup list key, right? It's called a database ID. It's the way, okay. Yeah. API connections can get to your database specifically. So yeah, if you need that, I can email you instructions on how to get that. But also, it would be a big help. And also, if you have a documentation for API key, like whatever the updates you have, you can shoot it to me so that my team, my technical team can take over and look at it, right? Perfect. Okay, what's your best email address? It's, you can write it down, sales, S-A-L-E-S, at the rate, intlg.com. Can you please repeat it once? So is it sales at the rate? I-N-T-L-G. L-G dot com. Dot com. Yes. Awesome. And the rate is T-H-E-R-A-T-E? Sorry? So you said sales at the rate, like T-H-E-R-A-T-E? No, no, no. No, no, no. It's just at. We usually mention like that for some clients we call at the rate, but it's at. That's all. Oh, sorry. At intlg.com. That's good. Got it. Okay, now I have it. Thank you so much. Sorry, but it's like muscle memory you can see. We deal with a lot of Indians too. No problem. Okay, so I'll email over those instructions on how to get the database ID and any API documentation that we have. Exactly, exactly. That would be a big help. Awesome. and what was your name? Jay this is Jay and we do have your account in the name of Legacy like we're using PC Alexa for 20 years I guess awesome alright I will send that over now Alex that would be big it was really nice talking to you Gary wish you a good day have a great day bye",
