    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. How are you doing today? I'm good. Is this Jeremy by any chance? No, this is David. I know Jeremy's been trying to get a hold of you. Yeah, I tried calling and I was not finding. Oh, wait. Maybe I'm spelling it wrong. Okay. Let me see. High-spleen vortex. Hold on one second. Because I had a message that I couldn't find it. And then Jeremy Hatton. In Vortex. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's just trying to get his Outlook set up, Robin. I forgot what it was he needed to download. I couldn't remember. Okay. Probably help us out. And he has a soft phone with RingCentral. Can we get Color ID set up on that too, Robin, or do you know? So, now, do you mean the click-to-dial or click? Yes. Click-to-dial. He doesn't have a hard. I have a phone here at my desk, but he doesn't have a phone. He uses the Internet through RingCentral. So he uses their RingCentral app? Yeah, he uses the RingCentral apps, what he uses, yeah. Okay. So, okay. And I'm sorry. And this is, who is this? This is Dave. Dave. Okay. Let me make sure I have the right email. Lortec. I wonder if I was spelling. Oh, you know what? I wonder if I was doing with an X. Yeah, everybody does. I'm going to give it a K, Robin. Ah. Okay. David Hosmer. Okay. So, I'm actually just writing an email to somebody else about Ring Central setup. So, here, I'm going to send you the instructions because there's some setup that you're going to have to do for him. And then, really, all he needs to do is just authenticate. Or do you want me to talk you through that? Yeah, you can. I guess if I got me on the phone, if I have to do something, what do I got to do, Robin? So, he's already got the app downloaded, though? Yeah, he does. He uses it every day. Okay, so what you'll have to do for him is go to system and then users. Users, okay. And then manage users. Oh, okay, got it. Okay, and then click on his username. Okay. And then next to the phone number field. Do you have his direct number in there? I don't know if I do or not, Robin. It's his old number. No, I don't. No, I don't. Let me see here. Make sure you put that in there because if you ever want to do anything more like opting in and out of text messages, that's the number. It'll try to merge in. How do I edit that? Anyway, Robin, where do I do that at? I don't have an option. It's to click his name. Oh, it's down here at the bottom. Contact information, security, and other information. Yeah. So right below full name. Put his RingCentral direct number there. that's just one part of it. Okay. I have to look it up I don't have it. Let me see I might be able to log into RingCentral real quick Robin right? So yeah and you need that direct one not the main number because caller ID is controlled within the RingCentral app itself. right that doesn't have anything to do with us let me log in here admin portal well is everything just going slow today or what geez come on there we go I don't have any patients today I guess Robin it's Monday does he cheer me I got his number here. Let me fix that. So it's 828-673-8873. Okay. And where do I save it here at the disk here? Okay. That's one thing that you have to do. Okay. Did that. Okay. Then what you're going to do is click next to that field. Click next to that field. Next to that phone field, you're going to click that gear icon. Wait a minute. I don't see no gear. What are you talking about, Robin? So for the ringtone next to that contact phone field, there's a gear icon just to the right of the field. Oh, yeah, where his phone's at. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Robin. I got you. Okay. When you click on that, click Ring Central. Okay. And the sidebar at the left. You'll need to put his direct number in both the phone number and direct dial number, but it has to be in the plus one format. It is. They're both already there. Okay. And where it says user phone configuration, he's got that all in one, right? So that has to be Ring Central app. so you have to go into the drop down make sure you see the full we're looking at okay so this phone number and direct dial it's his direct number in the plus one format right yes and then over to the right where it says user phone configuration says ring central app make sure it says ring central app not ring central desktop phone ring yeah it says ring central app it does yeah okay so that should be all he needs as long as he's got the all-in-one app installed on his computer. Okay. It's called all-in-one app? Well, it's just called RingCentral phone. I mean, it's just called RingCentral. Okay. It's the app that you actually install on your computer where it's got phone video. It's not a Chrome browser or anything like that. It's the actual app on your website. When he's on PC Recruiter and hits the person to dial, will it actually dial through this too? As long as he's got the app, what that thing is saying, pass that number over to that app. Okay, since I just updated that. His caller ID hasn't been working. That's the reason because he had his cell number in there. I changed it to a strict one. Well, caller ID is based on what's in the RingCentral app itself. We don't have anything to do with the caller ID. Okay. So he'd have to open up the app and you go to settings and where is it? Go to phone and then it says default caller ID. So that's where they could do like maybe your company number or his direct number. Okay. All right. Best managers in the app. Cool. And then the Outlook, you're just going to send me an email of what he needs to download or something? No. So I sent you the RingCentral stuff. Now, what does he need for Outlook? Well, like on mine, I have it where I can import resumes or whatever that option is called. I can drag the resume folder over and it creates the profile. What is that called? The Outlook portal. Is that what it's basically called? Yeah. Okay. I don't think he went through the whole setup when I added him to PC Recruiter on everything. This will take care of his phone. This other will take care of his Outlook, I guess. Is that all he needs to do? Yeah, I can send you instructions for that. Okay. Hold on one second. And the other thing, our roll-up lists are different on the options in the configuration. How do I give him mine or whatever is your way I can do that in PC Recruiter? Okay, I'm not sure. What was that about? We create like roll-up lists in PC Recruiter. Okay. And let me just open one. I'll show you what I mean. It's the stages. Yeah, his stages are different than mine. Okay, so he might even have different layouts and no preferences. When you added his username, did you copy settings from an existing user? Probably not. Okay. Probably not. So that would be done if you go to System, Users, and then you go to Copy User Settings. So I'd have to copy all my user settings and give it to him, right? Yeah, you would be the source username, and then underneath each heading, you select what to copy, but never copy form letters. Never copy form letters, okay. Never copy form letters. Okay. That's really true. And then you'd pick who to copy to over at the right. You could start with copying security. However, it does not copy the assist administrator setting, and you always want to double-check their securities anyway. Okay. All right, we'll figure that part out then. Okay. I got an email from you, Robin. Yep, here it is. So that was the RingCentral stuff when you're doing setup there. Do I need to send that to him, Robin? The only thing he'll have to do is probably the last portion where he's got to authenticate. As long as you did everything else. I did. The first part is you. The second part, there's like kind of like these steps are by the user. He's got to make sure he's got the RingCentral app and there's links to download it. And then he's got to authenticate from the MyPCR page. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That'll work. And then I will get the Outlook portal instructions over to you. That'll work great. Okay. Alrighty. I guess that's all we need, Robin. I appreciate it. Alrighty. and then if you need anything else just let me know, okay? Alright, thanks. Have a good day. Alrighty, you too. Thanks.",
