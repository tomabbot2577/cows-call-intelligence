    "text": " Hello, this is Scott. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail. Are you having trouble with PCR? No, I'm not having trouble with PCR, but I've been a PCR user now for a little more than nine years, and I'm looking to set up a couple of training sessions, One, to get a better understanding of some of the new unique AI features to PCR, like, you know, what's the latest and greatest that we're not using taking advantage of PCR for my team. And then I also need for myself, I kind of need a refresher training in PCR. Okay, cool. That sounds good. But so training hours, they cost $95 an hour, or you can buy them in packs of four at $80 an hour. Right. But I thought as a user, don't we get X amount of training sessions per year or something like that? No, you would get your kind of your onboarding hours. And then those expire after a few months, maybe I think six months is the current expiration rate on onboarding. But after that, any training hours would have to be purchased. Okay. So, but okay. So it's, yeah, I mean, so it's $95 an hour? Yeah, or you could buy them a pack of four for $80 an hour. if there are specific topics that you need help with, I could always look up to see if we have videos in our webinar library. They're kind of like prerecorded trainings about certain topics. Yeah, I'd rather do something live with someone from being sequenced and my team instead of the video, so I don't mind paying for that. Okay. All right, just wanted to double check. And the AI features. So currently right now we have a free trial where all of our customers have three AI features turned on. So they're in your database currently. They're the AI job description generator, the AI candidate summary generator and the AI email generator. So those are all in your database currently. And those ones are very easy. It's just a single click of a button and it'll generate something for you. And you can either adjust it from there or try generating it again. But there is a fourth AI tool called the AI search. And if you want, you just call in a request and we can turn that on for your database. It just requires that you have the latest database search engine called Lucene. I could actually let me pull up your database right now and check to see if it has that. If it does have that, I could turn that on for you right now. And the AI search, basically, when you first open it up each time, it'll have a short little guide that says, here's how you structure a question or a query. and it'll give you even examples and that'll kind of help you with that tool. Very, very simple usage for some of these new AI tools we have in there. So will that help us search for candidates in the database faster? It's maybe if you just want to search it a different way, it uses more common language phrasing. So you could say, show me all hiring authorities in Cleveland, Ohio, with a last activity in 2024. Something like that. So like a sentence, and then it would pull up those results. Right. But can I say, show me all candidates in Ohio? And it will, I mean, I guess I could do, actually, I wouldn't do that because I could just do it in PCR. Can I say, show me all RSM candidates in Ohio? Yeah, yeah, it would bring that back. So I think it gives you the top, I think, 30 results, the 30 best results matching your query. And you can look through those. Yeah, that's pretty cool. Now, can you do, can I do a keyword search? Like, will it search like so if there's resumes that are in PCR? Can I do a keyword search based upon resumes or notes that are in PCR? Let me double check on the notes part, but it does search the other parts of the record. Let me take a look. I have the article right here. Let's see. AI features for the AI search. There we go. So the AI search will... Okay, it won't take any actions on records. Okay, we know that part just for searching. Okay, it won't look through the contents of an attachment or profile. I think that's kind of the one thing it won't do, but it will, let's see, it will look through resumes and it'll look through keywords. It won't look through notes, though. Right, but a resume is an attachment, so it would go through a resume if a resume was parsed into PCR? Yeah, if it's in the resume tab on the record, it can search through that. It can search the keywords. Right, and the keywords as well, but it won't look inside the resume files or notes. It says no notes searching. Right, but if a resume is in PCR, it will search through the resume. Correct, yep. Okay, all right, awesome. Yeah, all right, so let's make sure that we have everything turned on, And then I want to, I guess, pay for, I guess I'll pay for four. Okay. So I'll send you an email. To start, I'll give you a link to a video here, just a short one about the AI features at the top of an article. And I'll just hit on those four features. I did just check in your database. It has the older search engine. So we're going to have to upgrade it to Lucene. So I'll just need some written, you know, confirmation from you. So I'll just have you reply to that email that you want to upgrade to Lucene, which is free during this trial period. So that'll be great. And then, yeah, and then we'll I'll talk to billing about sending over an invoice for the four hours. Right. Yeah. I mean, it's not going to be four hours at one time, but OK, that's awesome. Perfect. All right. Look out for an email from me, and we'll talk soon. Sounds good. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",
