    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I wanted to give you guys a try back. I spoke with Tyler earlier this morning and was reaching out initially. My PCR capture icon just wasn't popping up, and he let me know you guys did some sort of update this morning with that. I just had to restart the computer. I was hoping it would be cleared, but it's still just not popping up, so I just wanted to see if I could get a little bit of help with that. Sure. Let's jump on a screen share call. In a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. All right. I am there. Is it requesting a meeting ID? I have that ready. Okay. That's 314-679-709. All right, joining now. Awesome. And if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Okay. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. All right. Should be good to go, hopefully. Cool. Yep, I can see that now. All right. So let's check to make sure you have the latest version of Capture. Just go to the three dots at the top right of your browser. Okay. And then go to Extensions. Oh, I'm so sorry. I got my mom and youngest boy outside and fertilizer guys coming. and I just got to yell something to them super quick. No problem. I'm sorry, they're doing fertilizer right now. Teddy? Teddy? Okay. I'm sorry, Garrett. One second here. No worries. I'm very sorry. No worries. All right, Mom, if you could just bring him in. Teddy, let's go. Okay, I'm sorry about that, Garrett. Yeah, no worries. So we're in the, yeah, that menu at the top right, just go to extensions. Extensions, okay. Then manage extensions. and we've got capture 1.2.0 excellent that's the right version then at the top right of your browser there's the capture logo up there just click on that to open the capture menu okay oh yep I'm seeing I saw that also I've helped somebody I think we needed the latest browser version to fix that let's try that first so if you go to three dots again at the top right of browser go down to help towards the bottom and then about to Google Chrome and that should start updating Chrome okay we'll see if this works once it updates it'll ask you to relaunch Chrome where it'll close down and then reopen all your tabs at that point we'll lose the screen share but we should be able to still hear each other with the phone so that's fine. Okay. And yeah hopefully this is what gets it yeah just hit relaunch on there and then we'll and you can hit leave on that and we'll just kind of reconnect the screen sharing once it reloads Chrome for you. All right. Excellent. So even before you screen share, go ahead and click on that capture logo at the top right. Are you still seeing that tiny thin menu? Yeah. Yep. Yeah, it is still there. All right. Let's see. You know what? We could – maybe we should uninstall the tool and reinstall it. I think that would be good. So if you – actually, yeah, go ahead and share your screen again. Just go to the RingCentral meeting tab and click the blue share button and select your entire screen again. Okay. Screen. Excellent. Okay. So let's reinstall it. So if you go back to your extensions tab that you had open up at the top there, and then go ahead and hit remove on the PCR capture tool there on the right. Okay. And then you can hit remove. And then on the left, it says discover more extensions and themes on the Chrome Web Store. Go ahead and click on that. And good. And then the search bar at the top, PCR capture. Okay, and click that to select it, and then add to Chrome at the top right. And add extension. Okay, so it's installed again, and then we'll just get you signed back into the tool. So click the puzzle piece at the top right of the browser. It's like a little white, yeah, right there. Oh, this one? Yeah. Okay. And then pin the capture tool with the little pin icon. Okay. Now you have the logo up to the left of the puzzle piece. You can click on that, and it'll ask you for your PCR web address. If you want to go to whatever tab you have open with PCR, perfect. Just copy that full web address up at the top. Okay. The lakeside search group, then, is the web address? or no up above oh I'm so sorry yeah obviously yeah there you go copy that and no matter what tab you're on you could just go to that little icon at the top right um oh okay open up the capture menu and then paste that in all right log in and uh this needs your pcr username and password let's see how this works okay Yeah, you can stay on that tab and just click that icon. It's a tough way to open that again. Yeah, just hit Log In. All right. Try that again. And then choose your database first. Yeah, there you go. Excellent. That's my password. Okay, that's a good sign that the capture menu is looking normal again. So let's try jumping over to LinkedIn and see if it works for you now, if you have a tab open. Just open up anybody. Come on. Fingers crossed. Refresh. Yeah, try hitting refresh. That's always a good troubleshooting step. Oh, it looks like it. Nice. Oh, good. Okay. And if you click on that, does the full thing open up, the full capture? Okay, good. Yep, we're back in business. Awesome. Okay. Awesome. All right. Yeah, I'm going to make note of that. This new update, it seems like people are having to uninstall and reinstall the tool. So, yeah, I'm going to talk to my supervisor about that. But I'm glad we got that working for you. just let me know if any other issues pop up around the capture tool or if you have any other PCR related questions. Okay. I will really appreciate the help. You have a good day. You as well. Thanks. Okay. Thank you.",
