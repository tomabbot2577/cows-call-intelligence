    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, Paul. How are you? Hey, good morning or afternoon, wherever you are. How are you? I'm well, I'm well. That's right. It is morning for you out there in Pacific time. Yeah. Where are you at? Cleveland, Ohio. So it is 2 p.m. Cool. Okay. And I have Jason. Thanks for meeting this morning. Sure. Sure. Thanks. Glad we could get everything on the schedule to talk with Jason. So Jason's going to join momentarily. He's going to be your trainer. for PC Recruiter. Today he'll have a few questions for you about the setup and use of the system, kind of what you're doing now, email setup and stuff like that. And then after those questions are asked, he will go ahead and get the first couple of trainings on the calendar, likely prior to your, I think you're in the October class, October 6th? Yes. Okay, so yeah we'll get a couple of hours up before that. So end of the next week or two, perfect. They'll sign up. So we will just wait for a couple of minutes here until he joins. I'm of course going to be, if you need to add users, that's something that I would do that I could help with. Or if there was anything you needed in PC Recruiter that you didn't know who to go to, come to me and I can help you or get to someone who can. So that would be my job here. And Jason has just joined us. Hello, Jason. Hey, guys. Hey, Jason. Hey, Paul. How you doing? Good. Good. Yourself? I'm pretty good. All right. Friday's rolling pretty well for you so far? Oh, yeah. We're trucking along. So just I'll explain to Paul what we were doing today, what we do, what I do, what you'll do. And I wanted to go ahead and turn it over to you to run through the couple of questions you have, and then we can get a couple of the training hours on the schedule. He's in the October 6th training class for dimensional search. So that's when he'll want to have those done by those couple hours. Okay, perfect. Okay, Paul, I imagine like Jim said, I'm your trainer. I'm going to be handling all of that fun onboarding stuff with PC Recruiter. The questions I have are just going to kind of help guide me along our training process. So the first one I have, What type of placements are you planning on doing? Like permanent placement, contract? Like what are you thinking? Definitely permanent. Okay, awesome. And what industry are you going to be looking in? Manufacturing. Okay. And have you worked as a recruiter before? No. No? Okay. In the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? Possibly. I don't know. Okay, cool. I'm not far along enough to understand quite yet what I'll need that far out. Okay. If that ever were the case, just let Jim know and he can help adjust all that fun stuff. Okay. Have you ever worked with a CRM before? Yes. Okay. Do you mind me asking which one? Microsoft or whatever Microsoft uses. Okay. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah, I got you. Okay. So the speed at which we could take our training, we have a fast, moderate, or slow pace. Fast being three trainings a week, moderate being two, slow being one. Each training session is going to be about an hour long. And I believe Dimensional Search recommends having between two or three trainings under your belt before they begin their piece of things. Just kind of with where you are, what do you think is going to make the most sense for you? Do you want to do like a fast pace, moderate, or a slow? I mean, I learn a lot better if there's not a large gap between training sessions. So if we can put them together, I don't know. Yeah, if we can put them together closer, that's better for me, really. Yeah, absolutely. Let's go with a fast pace for now. And if we ever need to change things or put a pause on things while you catch up with some dimensional stuff, we definitely can do that. So just keep me in the loop. What operating system are you using, Windows or Mac? Windows. Windows. Okay. What browser are you currently using? Chrome. Chrome. Perfect. And your email provider, is it Microsoft? Is it Gmail? My business one through dimensional search is Outlook. So, yeah. Okay. Microsoft. Almost called it Hotmail. I'm old enough to have a Hotmail. Way old. Oh, yeah. Sorry, I have a few I have to answer myself. Okay. And usually with the dimensional search, folks, where you are is you have the intention of having a website, but you don't currently have that set up. Is that the case? I am partially through. I just worked with somebody this morning on getting it set up. So it's in the process. Okay, perfect. Okay, awesome. Those are the questions I have. So why don't we take a look at when we can get things scheduled? Usually how I like to schedule my training sessions is to choose like a consistent day and consistent time. So how would, since we're doing three a week, I think kind of spacing them out with a day in between would be good. So Monday, Wednesday, Friday. How does 2 p.m. Eastern look for you on those days? Let's see. I can figure my calendar out. All right. On Monday at, did you say 2 Eastern? Yeah, 2 Eastern. That works for Monday. Perfect. If you're talking next week. Yes, next week. Yep. How about Wednesday and Friday? If you have anything earlier, that would be even better, though. Yeah. How about, how's 10 a.m.? My time or your time? Eastern, yeah. Not, nope, I can't do 7 on Monday or Wednesday. You're three hours behind me. How would 1 p.m. Eastern be that day? I'm open at 10. on Monday and Wednesday. Okay. Monday, I'm blocked at that time. So would that 1 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday, would that work for you? Yes. Okay. And how about 1 p.m. Eastern on Friday? Yes. Okay, cool. So I'm going to get some invites put together and I'll send them over to you. There's just going to be a meeting link inside of there that you'll click on to join. That first training session that we're going to have, it is going to be fairly administrative. It's just kind of setting up users, getting email connected, doing all of that fun stuff. So just anticipate it being a lot of that. But by the second session, we'll dive into the specifics of everything. But do you have any questions for me? What time did you say on the 22nd are we meeting? The 22nd, I had said 2 p.m. Eastern. I could also do 1 p.m. Eastern if that's better. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 1 p.m. Eastern would be great. Perfect. And are you going to send invites for each of those days? Yeah, I'm going to send invites for all of those days. Okay, cool. Jim, do you have anything else? I do not. I'm all good. Look forward to getting up on the hop and running. All right, well, that was easy. Thank you. Thanks for going over that. And I'm glad that we get to get this started so much quicker because I heard that this could take a little bit of time. So I appreciate you guys jumping on. Yeah, absolutely. I hope you have a good day, Paul. All right. Thanks, Jason. Thanks, Jim. Thank you. Bye. Bye bye.",
