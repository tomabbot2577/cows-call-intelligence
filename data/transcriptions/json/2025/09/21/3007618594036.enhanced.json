    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Connie Rose, and I'm a new employee today for, actually, it's under Alexander Hamilton, but parent company, Financial Recruiters International. And I have a spreadsheet with instructions, and I have downloaded a lot of things, but it doesn't look right to me. so I want to go over with you. You might be able to screen share with me. It doesn't look like what I'm looking for in PC Recruiter, and I've never used PC Recruiter as a software before. So how can we get connected with UPC Share Screen and I can show you what I've downloaded and show you my spreadsheet with the record? If you just go to a new tab in your browser and then go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And there's just join a meeting. Perfect. And I can give you a meeting ID whenever you're ready. I'm ready. Okay. That's 517-040-941. 517-040-941, correct? Perfect, yep. Hit join. Open range extension. Here we go. Come up on another screen. Okay, perfect. I see you joined. You can hit the mute button at the bottom left so there's no echo since we're already on the phone. I'm trying to move it to my screen. That's where most of it is. Okay. There we go. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Where's the screen? I've lost you. Oh, are you still on the RingCentral meeting? Can you still see that? Can you still hear through the phone? Yeah, I still hear through the phone. That's really weird because I just clicked over to RingCentral, I mean not RingCentral, PC Recruiter, and then it tells me to open RingCentral again. That's weird. And I checked always from this browser. That's crazy. I think you're still on the RingCentral meeting. It just might be open in your RingCentral app now, or it could just be one of your browser tabs. Let's see what this has done. It's not in the browser tab. Open RingCentral. So I'm on my app. Oh, here it is. Let me get my browser. When you hop from, I'm running three monitors, so. Okay. I don't know why I did that. It minimized. Okay, I did hit mute. Okay, so then if you're looking at the RingCentral meeting, just hit that blue share button at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Oh, I got a call coming in from Kevin. Okay, I can hold. Okay, thank you. Hi, Kevin. Kevin? Okay, you were, the volume wasn't high, so I missed what you were saying. That's okay. I'm setting up your email right now in PCR. Okay, cool. and I need to know that your passwords are accurate on line 21 and on line 18. Let me take a look but I'm pretty sure because I've been in that. Yes, because I've, yes, I've used these I haven't set up Alexander Raymond yet but I've set up financial recruiters and I have used that password. Alright. And I will use, I will use the one on Raymond James but I'm Raymond James, what's that? No, I mean, not Raymond James. That's another staffing agency. Alexander Raymond. I'm sorry. They're not a staffing agency. They're actually Raymond James is the broker dealer that we actually borrow people from. I've spoken with him before. So, yeah, just. All right. So, community. Connie at Alexander Raymond. That password is not working. Oh, I need your password for... I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It can't be for Alexander Raymond. Right. All right. Let me see. Let me see. Next. Okay. Okay, do me a favor and go find out what your password is for Connie at AlexanderRaymond.com. I've got it right here. I'll give it to you. Put it in the sheet on 21B. Yeah. Ah, so we changed it. Well I don't know what it's been, it's been just a day, but that's under financial. That's right, that's why we have this page. That's right, that's under financial. And Recruit Today, 778-POUND. Not working. I mean, Recruit Today, 778-POUND. No. Okay, hang on a minute. I'm kind of crazy right now because I got a guy on hold that called me when he saw me. Who's on hold? I called support on PC Recruiter because I installed it, but it didn't look right. And I know what you want, so I'll fix it, and I'll call you back. Don't call me. Just put it in the space 31D. That's what I'm going to do. Okay. Okay. You there? Are you there? Can you hear me now? Yes. I knew what he wanted. So we got off the phone and I'm going to enter some passwords for him. Usually when I'm involved in something like this, I hear from him and it's a distraction. But, you know, that's the way it goes. Got it. Can you see my screen now? Yeah. Can you hit the mute button at the bottom left? We'll just go through phone again. And I'm going to be putting in some passwords here for him, okay? I'll put it on mute right now. There we go. And can you still hear me through phone? Okay, good. All right. So yeah, I can see your screen. And so we were looking at what did you want to show me on your screen related to PCR? Okay. This is where I'm at. It's in the Google Workspace. And I really don't know what I'm doing. I'm looking at the screen that has Pandora. If you have Google Workspace, can you drag it maybe over to the screen that has Pandora? Okay, hang on a second. Do I drag your box when you're connected or? Oh, I'll drag PC. Okay. There we go. Yeah, I can see Google Workspace now. Perfect. So I'm going to go back to my spreadsheet. I've been trying to get back in this box and it's not. Release it. What's that? Okay. I need to redo this. I'm sure I can do it. Maybe this is a little bit more. All I need to do is put some passwords in, and now I don't have the full. I'm new to Google as well, using Google. I'm used to other softwares. Oh, yeah, no worries. How can I get, I need to put in a password on line 21, I think I need to go right here, 21B. Why do I not have, why can I not get back in there and put a password? Are you, so you're on an Excel spreadsheet or something on a different page, on a different screen? Yeah, it's a spreadsheet on a different screen. You know, for logins and passwords, and I need to change. I'm working for two companies, parent company and then the sister company. So the parent company has one email and password, and the sister company has one email and password, and they're different. So what's happened is somebody put in some, you know, generated, you know, email, but I went in and changed that, but it didn't change on this list. And so I'm in here and I'm going to change in 18. I'm going to change in 21, but I can't make the change. Are you, if you're using Excel, sometimes there's a button that says enable editing at the top of the file. But if you're on a different program. It's a Google Excel. Yeah. Okay. I am not sure. Okay. I just put the browser in there. So let me, you continue looking around and I'm going to put in here what they need. Okay. And then we'll go down here. Yes, Karen. Thank you. Okay. So he can do what he needs to do. You can hear me through the phone, correct? Yeah, yeah. Okay. So now, yeah, because what I did, I followed some instructions. I'm going to pull over this Excel spreadsheet so you can see it, okay? And you'll be able to see the instructions or the sequence to install, download and install PC, PCR, then the Java, then the launcher. So what I've done is I have downloaded, or thought I did, PCR, and then I also did PCR capture. And I also, I'm trying to figure out, I'm going, the link for the Java was through Amazon, and I downloaded that, and I kept that up. in case you might want to be able to see it. Can you see this screen where it says Amazon? No, I haven't seen the screen that says Google Workspace Marketplace. That's the screen you're sharing. Right. So let me – I'm going to drag it over. I'll just put them back later. Okay. There we go. Yep. Okay. So I'm seeing the RingCentral browser tab now. Okay, good. I don't need that. I'll get rid of that. Why didn't that move? Here we go. So in here, I was instructed, and you probably see from that list. Okay. I'm going to pull over this. So, yeah, basically it seems like you're just setting up your computer, getting everything installed, the Java, PCR launcher, and the capture tool. So I can walk you through those. the instructions might be, you know, a little complicated with the Amazon thing there. So yeah, let's just walk through, get your pieces installed. So to start, just in a new tab in this browser here, go to java.com. I'll be here in a little second. Let me minimize some of this stuff. It's just going to be confusing. And I put that somewhere else. Go back to Chrome. Okay, I have Java and Google Chrome browser. Okay. And then so yeah bring that over to the screen that I can see The one that says Google workspace There we go So yeah up in your actually go up to your web address bar up at the top Above the search bar type in java.com and then hit enter Perfect this will take you to java.com and then towards the bottom click on download Java for desktops and And then that button again, download Java for desktops. And you can save that. It looks like it's just saving it in documents. Perfect. I just saved it in the main. Oh, good. Just click on that file at the top right to run it. Yes, to allow that. You don't see these screens that it's installing. Yeah, perfect. So that'll be Java. That's the first piece. Next, we'll look at PCR Launcher as soon as that's done. And these two programs, they run in the background on your computer, PCR Launcher and Java, so that different pop-ups can appear in PCR. you have the full functionality. What is he saying? He's distracting me and I'm sorry because I'm trying to talk to you. He said it is in the RingCentral app as a text message. I know that's why I did it because I want you to get it right away. Out of a... What should I do here? It says out of date Java version detected. Okay, what are your options to click on? Not now and uninstall. Okay, so I'm going to click on uninstall. Go to uninstall. Pardon me. He's calling me. Hi, Kevin. Hello. Hello, Kevin. Hello. Hello. Sorry about that. That's okay. Did you get a code text message in the RingCentral app? Okay. Hang on. Let me look in RingCentral. I had to move my essential app over here. Let me move this box. Okay. No. I'm in the app and I don't see it. It was sent to me on the phone. Okay. No, not, not coming. I'm in the, I'm in the app and I don't see it. They were sent to me on the left side. It says message video phone in text. Right. There's a message. You go to London messages. Keep going down below messages, those video. On the left side? Yeah, I'm under video now. So the next one down is phone and then text. Click on text. It says my text is unavailable. So that needs to be reset because it's screwed on with your stuff. Okay, try it another way. Hang on. Okay. That was on my list to ask about. Yeah, that should have automatically been done. So the verification phone. I need to go in. All right, I'll catch you in a bit. Okay, thank you, guys. Okay, are you there? I'm back again. Hello? Hello? Can you hear me now? Yeah, I can hear you. Excellent. Let me minimize this right here. So we're back to where it says not now and uninstall. I wouldn't say uninstall. Yeah, uninstall the outdated version and it will then install the correct version. That's probably because of my PC. It's a fairly new computer, but not that new. It's about a year old. So I don't use, knowingly, I don't use Java a lot, but it's probably running in the background programs. Yeah, it's kind of a background task. Yeah, no worries. It'll update that for you. And so my software background has been, you know, with my own company, custom software, and then Microsoft, Adobe, those types of things. So I've never really used Google that much, but they use Google across the board and PC Recruiter. I see. And so those we successfully added. Awesome. Okay, so job- So that maybe wouldn't work. Yeah, and next we'll do the PCR launcher. So to install that, do you have your link to access PCR, the web address? Yes. Okay. I do. Hang on one second. Let me take a look. I'm trying to minimize. Let me get my full toolbar up. Okay. Let me. It's 12. Oops. you know what 1245 and it's 1247 I've got a 12 o'clock I'm in Eastern time I've got a 1 o'clock that I cannot miss okay if you want to we can hop off at any point and just call back our support line if you want to continue or need more help that's what I'm going to do I have to continue that way because this is my second day on the job and I don't want to miss this thing Okay. Yeah, no worries. I apologize. It's not a problem. It's typical first day or two, first week. Yeah, a lot of sped up. Thank you very much. Just call back in and say, I need help getting the PCR launcher and PCR capture installed, and we'll be able to help you. Okay. Thank you so much. All right. Have a good one. Bye. Bye-bye.",
