    "text": " This call is being recorded. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hi, Jillian. This is Robin Mantoni. Hey, Robin. How's it going? Oh, pretty good. I am so sorry. My daughter moved into Ohio State the other day, but she broke her laptop. Oh, no. Yes, my son kind of – she had it sitting on her bed. My son went to the room, sat down on it, cracked the screen. And so we had to take it to the microcenter to get it fixed. She had to leave for school without it, but she's got a friend moving in today. So we were, like, hoping to get it – Disaster. Yeah, hoping to get it done in time where she could take it to her. And, yeah, they got it fixed, but the touchscreen still isn't working. so she's got one more friend living tomorrow so oh yeah fingers crossed they get their first first year first year or second year second year that's awesome yeah nice um kind of bittersweet right like get them out of the house but miss them oh no it's so hard yeah it's so hard yeah and my son's at well he's at school too but he's i mean he's at a different school so it's like We go from chaos, you know, to nobody home being empty nesters. It's a little adjusting. Absolutely. I totally get it. Nice. Hey, I appreciate the call and the information. Yeah, I checked everything. I didn't see a charge. I was like, wait a minute. Yeah. Well, it's so weird because with the way QuickBooks, I guess, used to be, They didn't really have like an auto pay. So what they used to do for customers is you send like a sales receipt and it would process card, but it really does just like emailing you receipt. So it looks like paid. Yeah. And which is one of the reasons why we went into Uber. I was like, yeah, it's good. Like, yeah, you know. Yeah. It's just kind of like, you know, I was trying to explain to somebody because we have this bookkeeper now that's doing consulting. She's the one that like noticed it. And she's like, there's no card process. is just and i'm like but it says paid she's like if you look in this area it never attempted the card the card was saved but there was like literally like one extra check box you had it select for it to do that so there's you know with 1500 customers there's like six or seven where that unfortunately happened too so one of us made a mistake yeah yeah yeah no worries um yeah totally makes sense. Do you know how many users you were billing for at that time? Let's see. Let me check on these. How do we have a chat? I think it was billing us at six, if I'm not incorrect. I don't know if it was more than that. Okay, so these were all the $312.90 price. Okay, so let me look into one of these. These have been in sales receipts. What's the date of one of these? Okay. The $312.90 price was when you were at six users. Got it. And then it looks like more recently they're lower. Let's see. In July, you were at... I changed. Yeah. and July. Reason being is like we've parsed down our users starting in October and November like we even went down to four free users in November and then kind of continued with that and now we're down to essentially three. The reason I bring this up is like now it's coming to my attention. Now I'm like going back and like, oh, well, I didn't even update that. Yeah, we didn't get noticed. Like right now, like I was saying, your most recent invoice looks like it was for four users. Yep. We have one, two, three. That fourth, I guess we got to keep that fourth. so yeah we went down to four yeah it looks like you run from six to four and we always do like a ticket for user change requests because we can't rely what's on in the database because some people like api users or so yeah exactly you have to let us know when um yeah changes so it looks like that was done so that moved down in in february because we had to let some people go and yada yada and then We have gone through an interesting six months. Yeah, it looks like we did a user change request from you June 24th that went from six to four. Yeah. And so I don't know from the get-go if the billing is completely accurate. But it was one thing I wanted to bring to your attention. uh the other thing i didn't i didn't know if you had my pre received my previous email on uh kind of thoughts and suggestions on pcrm um it's gotten it's made a lot of progress a lot um some areas are still pcr8 looking where they haven't been redesigned um basically in times more where it's more streamlined and it's not yeah like things are more consistent easier to get to um yeah you know as you know pcr has a ton of features and just making everything more streamlined um but yeah it's made a lot of progress we definitely have some people on there some screens are still um we call it uh like pcr like i think like the schedule is still pcr 9 like that kind of screen um yeah but like you're searching it's got what's called simple sequencing and advanced sequencing. So instead of using like roll-up stages, you actually can do more like, in a roll-up you could do what they call simple sequencing where you kind of take people through a path of things. So there's definitely a lot of good things. They were just, I think it went out, there's a new candidate AI match in PCRM available where if you're on a position, and it'll try to find, I think it's the top 25 candidates based on, you know, certain words for you. That's great. Yeah, so definitely making a lot of progress. That's awesome. Yeah, the reason I bring it up, I sent an email and we've recently looked at, and I've been through like changes in process and business development, et cetera. And there's some, like, key things that modern-day CRMs, executive search firms, are utilizing that PCR kind of lacks. And the main one is a client portal with, like, customizable candidate, you know, views. The second one would be, like, you'll have sequencing, but, like, a unified task management view. If you ever use like, I mean, you know, you're, you know, your competitor is Freelite, right? Yeah. I mean, I've heard of them. Yeah. But yeah. And if you ever utilize their tool or you ever utilize like HubSpot, they have a bit or outreach or sales loss. They all have like a centralized task management system that basically unifies, hey, I'm going to schedule something. Remind me in the future to call joineries because I need to check in with whatever. But also my sequencing tasks are pushing. They're telling me to do something. So you like you basically have your to do list all in one view. And then the other thing would be tagging system. y'all started to do it in pcr but it's only three basically making your keywording a tagging system uh seems to be like increased speed and ease of use and categorizing filtering contacts clients etc companies things that nature on the fly um and i'll say i'll forward this i wrote an email to you so you can yeah i even yeah i forward that over i don't really have anything to do with the features but I did forward that stuff over. Yeah. So these are all strong suggestions. I don't know who pulled the strings there. I even sent y'all the, and I was like, this is something y'all need to tackle. The reason I haven't used PCR since like 2008, like, you know, I've seen it go through all the things and just something to be aware of of, you know, as y'all are perfecting PCRM, I think y'all could really crush it with those recommendations to match what the marketplace is, you know, et cetera. So, I'm thinking out loud. I know you gave me different options of getting this settled and paying back. What do you think about me paying it in full, but at a discounted price? Reason being with billing, we were probably down to four users and, you know, go back and calculate that to get a single, kind of get it handled, move forward. And my idea is if we can take, both of my recommendations, I know I'm not the biggest office users of PCR, but any kind of like push we can make to get some type of action on those items, if that was something y'all would be open to doing. Let's see. I mean, we didn't get the request until June. So, these are all like way before that for user changes. Yeah, yeah, exactly. We didn't notify y'all. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I didn't know if it would make sense. what is the bill you put in there balance $2,500. Right. These were all $3,290. So those were all six users from August to March. Yeah, exactly. Because we didn't get notified of the user drop until did I say June? Yeah. Until June. Yeah, exactly. When I had to kind of step back in. There's some personnel change I kind of got. I was working on a new project with another firm and got pulled away from that. So now we're both looking at it, right? We're both going back to our books and correcting what we both didn't catch. and then that's all in my mind you know, totally makes sense let's get it done, let's move forward and can get it all paid at a you know, in full at a discounted price, seems to make sense in my mind what do you think? I don't have the authority to say that, so I would have to tell that, I somebody yeah yeah Yeah. But that's my thought process to it. And working with PCR and to, you know, the filing and the updating and the billing structure and all that good stuff. And we're now both taking a look at it. If it makes sense, we can get it done and, you know, get you all paid and move forward. and ideally get some push on some improvements to PCRM adoption-wise. Kind of where I'm at as a search firm. Does that make sense? Or have I had to sit down and, you know, look at it now? Yeah, I just – I can't change what the rate was. I mean, we weren't notified of user changes until, you know, three months after those. So, as far as we know, you had six users, whether they were logging in or not, we, you know, something we don't really know or track. So, I mean, those amounts were based on what the user count was at the time. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense, too. Yeah. Yeah. But, yeah, so maybe check back. I could split it up over, you know, one, three, six months, or if you want to do, how many are there? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Like, if you want to do, like, I think it kind of makes it easier if we do, like, either an invoice for one or an invoice for two months. And that way it's just kind of, it's a line item. I would just put this covers the August 21st invoice. This one is the September 21st. So however we break up the invoices, but you know, you could do several in one, a couple others in another invoice. I think it just makes it easier to do it that way where we're not taking one amount and splitting it over like eight invoices over six months, you know, it might be easier just to kind of break them down where there's like at least one or two invoice what what am i what am i paying now you are now at oh my gosh i just had that screen up where to go your four users right here it is okay you are now at four users $50 each user $4.50 $2.00 is what I'm paying for my yeah it actually comes out to $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 $2.08 That's what the rate is now. And times eight payments is 1,600. Yeah, but it wasn't at four users. Correct. So I'll just tell you where I am. In my seat, y'all made a mistake. Fine, cool. Y'all are coming back to me. I also made a mistake in not informing you all. So there's a delta in my mind between $1,608 and $2,503. And that's fine. My proposal in the... reason I wanted to talk to you is two things. There's a delta between, what is that, 22503 of $834, right? So I was thinking because we both made mistakes here, why don't I pay you one full-time amount to get this settled? So it's done. We move on at a discounted price. Makes sense in my mind. If that's completely not possible or if you can't go back and ask for that or whatever, what are my options then? I would have to do a little review of how many users were really logging in at the time. I don't know I don't have the authority to do anything like that so I would have to first of all get approval but I'll have to go with them with more details so I'll need a little time to look into it to get that information together yeah completely makes sense that's kind of where I'm at with this if we can get the money now and get it settled at a discounted price because we both made mistakes And then now we can get it settled and move forward. And, hey, let's take these. Another thing to keep in mind, hey, here's what's going to keep me as a customer. These things matter to us, like tag management, client portal, single task view. So if you're talking with leadership, if you can include that in the conversation, I'd appreciate it. All righty. All right. Yeah, let me, I mean, I'm not very hopeful on it, but I will see if I can find out. Okay. I appreciate it. Yeah, no, thank you for talking it out with me. Hopefully it makes sense from my point of view. I get it from your point of view completely. So let me know what the team says, and then we can figure out a good way to move forward. And call me or text me anytime if you need me. Okay, sounds good. Fair enough. Alrighty. Cool. Thanks. Awesome. Thanks, Robin. Talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.",
