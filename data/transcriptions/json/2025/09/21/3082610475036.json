    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. Hey, Jim. How are you? It's actually Robin. Oh, hi, Robin. I'm very late in getting back to you on your sequence issue, but I will be honest. I still don't understand it. All right. I'm like this. I guess it went back and forth and back and forth through the developers. That rate limiter, it's not, I guess, per sequence as there is what they told me. Oh. So I'll be honest. I don't really understand it. It is kind of like per your alias. And I guess the reason was is if you had, let's say, multiple sequences starting at 9 o'clock. Yeah. If they were all using 20 minutes, then you could hit your max. So what they kind of do is they space it out like, okay, we can grab these and then we'll send them. But it's more per your alias. And then it'll wait a little bit before it says the next. So I think what you might be able to do is instead of doing like two per hour or things like that, like you had in your sequences, maybe just go ahead and bump it up to 20 because it would go by more your alias and not the actual sequence is what they're saying. Interesting. Yeah, it's very interesting. I just really don't understand why. I think it's a little misleading. It seems like there should be some other settings. I don't really know, but I guess it went back and forth. So I think on your sequences, maybe if you just do like 15 or 20, then at least we'll get more out. I'm trying to – I really don't know how to explain it because, trust me, I was getting a lot of pushback. I'm like, that makes no sense to me. But it wouldn't do, okay, you have three sequences running, and now we're all – we're going to send 60 emails. if I want to do three campaigns each sending five emails an hour, then I would set them all at 15? That's what it's sounding like. Okay. But then yours, which was weird, is that Dan was grabbing... So your one sequence, okay, it was the hello sequence. Yeah. You had it set to six per hour. Yeah. Okay, you had the rate limiting defined for the step. At 9 o'clock, it said 6. But then at 9, it was like every 15 minutes, it was sending four more. And that's why I was like, I don't understand this pattern. And then they're like, well, that may be. So it is grabbing a little bit more like every 15 minutes. Okay. Which is still okay, really, because the big thing is the per minute restriction. What is the per minute? Well, it depends on your mail server. Like if you're like on, what is it? Let's say if you're Office 365, they have a limit that you can only send 30 emails per minute. Yeah. Okay. I mean, yeah, I'm not going to hit 30. Okay. Yeah. So I would say just maybe set them to like 15. Okay, great. And then if it does do like 15, if it does, but then it was really odd with yours and they're like, And that's something I guess we had to look at because your other ones were two, but then it was sending four. So maybe it was grabbing 15 minutes later. It was sending the two other campaigns. Could be. Yeah, I don't know. That's the only thing. Why is it getting four? So I think it sent your six. Then it waited 15 minutes before sending the next batch. And since they were only two, but then that's only two per hour. So why did it grab another 15 or another four 15 minutes later? Yeah. Okay. It's a little harder for me to understand. I think you can at least bump it up a little bit so eventually they're going out it's just like at an odd pace okay are you okay with that answer for now? yeah I'm fine you can close it, that's fine okay thanks Robin, I appreciate it oh you're welcome, thank you alright, bye bye",
