    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning, this is Jim. Hey, Paul, how are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Sorry, I didn't have my sound on. How are you now? No problem. Very well. Very well. Well, thanks for joining me today. Yeah, so I wanted to talk a little bit. I think what we were going to talk about today is the sequencing piece for PC Recruiter and also the premium package that includes it, kind of what's included in that, etc. Yes, I think I had seen it one time quite a while ago. And I think with all the AI stuff going around and people talking to my people about functionality like that, I'm like, my people don't realize that PC Recruiter has some functionality that we don't use. So I wanted to refresh myself again and then maybe introduce it to other people as we kind of decide on some additional software potentially that we might use. So just so you know, I don't know if you know these guys. They say they integrate with you, but I think they might figure out how to integrate with you. Are you familiar with a company called Fathom? I've heard of it. Are they like a note taker? I think that's how they initially have sold themselves but they also do kind of a drip campaign I think and what they sold one of my guys on he's like look at this and I'm like we already have software that does that yeah yeah you just I just want to yeah yeah we do uh yeah so that is something a lot of times companies like fathom write their own integrations we don't even always know about it because we have an open API so sometimes they'll write it for another customer and then word gets out and they kind of start approaching our other customers, we don't even know. So they might have something like that, but it's certainly worth taking a look at PC Recruiter since we include it. So it's the next package up, essentially. So, yeah, let me share my screen to kind of show you a little bit about what it does and how it works and all that good stuff. So I'm going to share the screen. Let me know if you see my sign-in screen to PC Recruiter. I do. Okay, perfect, perfect. So what it does, the premium package of PC Recruiter is going to essentially add primarily three features to your existing database. So it would just add some new tiles up at the top of the screen here, notably analytics, sequencing. It would also add the email campaigns functionality. So that's going to give you the ability to do sequences completely within PC Recruiter. And the nice thing about our sequencing tool is it could be something that is merely emails only. So maybe send an email, wait three days, send another, wait five days, send another. Or you could make it something that could include calls, texts if you use RingCentral. You could include a reminder to schedule an event, a reminder to do something on LinkedIn. So let's take a look at what it does. So if I click into the sequencing up top, it opens up a whole new tab initially. So you're still going to have your PC recruiter open, but it opens up a whole new tab. And then you can go in here to the templates. And this is where you are able to design what your sequences are going to do. If you add it, you do get these two templates come with the system for free. So they're kind of pre-populated. You can change them or make them your own or create your own as needed. But if I go in here and I go to edit a template name, nope, nope, nope, that's not one. I want to go to branches. at branches. This is where you're able to essentially build kind of the framework of what's going to happen. Usually, the first step is going to be send an email. So you're able to kind of pick which form letter, and it's merely a form letter as part of your PC recruiter database. Then you're going to be able to see if they reply to the form letter, they're done in this case. But if no interaction occurs in three days, but you might make that four days or nine days, continue to the next step, which is going to be a call. So in this case, it'll add them to a call list if they don't interact with it. And then that's kind of in that task list we just saw there a minute ago, which we'll go back and visit. But when you make that call, and I'll show you how we do that, you can either say, you can mark it connected, left message, no answer, and you're able to take each possible outcome and just designate what happens once you select that outcome, and then it would go, in this case, to another email down here. So this one's a little more interactive. I think it's only a few steps. So I think this one's just yeah, so it's email call email Yeah, very simple, but it could be some people creepies and they're like 10 15 steps and Option a would wrap them down another branch and you can get really fancy I like to keep it simple and a lot of people it might just be Three emails over two weeks or it might be one a little bit more complex that includes a call like this So what happens is when you kick off that sequence, and it runs off of a roll-up list, by the way, what's cool about that is if you kick off the sequence to the existing list, everybody on that list is going to get that first email and start their way down the sequence. And as you add people to the list down the line, each one of them starts as soon as they're added to the list. It'll add them. It'll start them on that sequence. So it's going to be able to kind of keep it an ongoing process. and then if you go through and you have for example in this candidate reach out 209 people started my sequence 18 of them have gotten to the point where I need to call them what's cool about this is it makes a little to-do list in here for you so you can go to the first person it's going to pull up their record show a few fields show a few activities you can set it up to dial using ring central so you can click the dial right there that'll also track that a dial was made maybe even populated with a script so all the recruiter has to do is click the dial, read the script, mark what happened. Then it'll toggle to the next person. Then you click the dial, read the script, mark what happened. So it's going to let you just kind of move through here if you're doing something like a call or... Go ahead. When you're doing that and there was a script there, do you recommend, as far as usage goes, like someone set it up for other people? Is that how your customers are using it? Or does each person set up their own campaign typically? Either, whatever you prefer. A lot of times people, customers will set up one or two primary campaigns that you're going to use, then everybody can kind of work with that campaign. But if your users want to set up their own specific campaigns, they can kind of keep their own individual campaigns. It might be a little unique to them, then they're going to have it as their campaign running on this screen. So anytime we use it Internally here, we all create our own. So we would like a marketing guy might or I'll create one or support people might, anything like that. Yeah, it could be either. Okay. And then some of these could be – Do you recommend a certain size of roll-up list? No, because what you can do when you set up the campaign, you can tell it only do like 200 a day or only do 50 a day or something like that. And you can add to the roll-up list any time. So any size is really fine. and then you might have something like LinkedIn related items these are maybe part of my step is send a connection request so if I click right there I can go view their LinkedIn profile do what I need to do then mark what happened that'll move to the next step so maybe even a scheduled item if I wanted to schedule a call it won't actually send the request that's a manual thing that you would do but it reminds you to it is that true yeah it reminds you to go there you can actually click when you click there there's a view LinkedIn profile if you have their photo and their LinkedIn address you can click right to it then you have to do it doesn't it doesn't automatically do it yeah and then schedule would do so if you click into that one it's going to give you a little scheduler over here let you put on your calendar pick your time your date set an alarm kind of send it on out so a few different things that can be part of the sequence there and then what's cool is you can even look at like metrics and results on the sequences so you can see kind of what who's completed and everything. Or if you look at sequence results, it gives you some different reports there. You can look at different sequences you might have running. So you're going to be able to kind of track what's going on. And also logs activities in the specific records. A lot of times there's sequence-related activities in there. So it'll say sequence phone call made, sequence text sent, something like that. So it's going to give you the ability to set up and use these nice automated sequences, but you're keeping everything in-house. You're not paying for a separate product, and you don't have to push or integrate or API call or anything like that. Everything's included in PCO. Right. So that's a nice feature of that. Okay. Okay. And then also included in that, simple bulk email. When you send a bulk email, also off of a roll-up list, it's going to give you a couple additional functions. So if I go into my list here and I just select a couple of people or all or whatever, the bulk email campaign's capability, when you send a campaign, you can pick an existing campaign. maybe I want to update your contact info and then you can go ahead send it to a different address field it's going to always go to primary email address but you could pick others if you wish you can set it from a different alias if you had like a send to grid account you could pick that and I like this too because this will let you send it later you can actually go to advanced and queue up maybe you want to do a Thursday at 6 a.m. so you could queue up many email campaigns and this is just a one-time campaign as opposed to an ongoing sequence so this is just one mass email queuing it up to be sent out and then that too is part of the reporting option in the analytics area okay so you're just saying a normal bulk email is going to get included in the analytics yeah oh yeah because if you look at the email campaigns piece that's where you're able to go and see anytime I sent an email for example the last time I sent update your contact info it's tracking open rates click rates any replies unsubscribes or bounces. I can even go down here and see who clicked what, how many times, and when they last did. So all that information. Do you recommend kind of a second domain for that? Because we've kind of gone away from some of the bulk emailing because our email gets listed badly. What I recommend is to use something like SendGrid. So if you use SendGrid, anytime you're sending a bulk email just send it out of your sync or alias it's still going to come from or appear to come from your existing mail address and going to be returned to your existing mail address but it allows you no limits when you're sending emails and you're not risking your mail provider so right right right yes send grid yeah they're a good option for that mail gun I think also does it but SendGrid is a little more popular. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate that. For sure. Okay. Okay. So what that's going to do, those three pieces primarily are going to comprise, and the AI, they've included the AI for the summer, I think, but it would be included in your premium plus upgrade here that I would do. To get these features, all it does, it's an additional $20 per user per month, and then $500 one time to set it up. And the $500 one-time setup is going to include six hours training, and it enables these new features for everyone in your database. So it adds all the new stuff, and then you have the ability to go through six hours of training with a dedicated trainer. And then it just takes you from whatever you're paying, just $20 more on that. And you've got the Premium Plus package, and that's everything we have now. All these are in our Premium Plus, including the AI and everything. The AI functions that you guys are working on right now, Are they to help you with writing form letters? How is that utilized or how are you guys doing that? One of them can do that. So if you send an email, one of the AI pieces is on an email send screen. So any send screen, and I think you could generate a form letter like this as well. So you just go to any send screen, and then you would just hit the little AI generator. And here you can pick kind of whether you want it to be casual or formal. You can say whether you want it to be – maybe it's a new job opportunity. It will generate something. And then you can kind of add it, mention it's a sales job, see about setting up a call next week, something like that. So you can kind of work back and forth with it a little bit to generate an email there. And then the other – Our normal thing, we're not using it inside you guys right now, but we usually tell it what we want, and then we ask it to make it better than what we did. Can you start with something you like and ask it to improve it like we're doing now, or do you start with theirs and then just kind of change it around? I think you start with theirs and then ask it to regenerate or comment, mention this or do this or talk about this or something like that. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Certainly. Certainly. Yeah, so that's kind of all around what it does, what it includes, and kind of how everything would work with that. It's a pretty quick setup, new contract, but it gets you set up there. It adds all these new features, and then it's all encompassed in PC Recruiter. Okay, good. I think I watched a video that you guys put out maybe a couple years ago on sequencing or drip campaigns. I don't think you call it drip campaigns. and it was much more in-depth, which was good and bad, because when we did our first demo a while ago with it, it was so in-depth we thought, like, the majority of our people who've done this a long time and maybe started on paper years ago just would not be able to get it. That's why I asked about, like, could we get it for specific people and not for other people? The young people, I think, would catch on to this quickly. Our older staff would be like, what? I'm not sure they'd even use it. Yeah, you could have it. It'll be available to everybody, but everybody doesn't have to use it. And you could have a certain person that creates all of the sequences. And then certain older people, if they wanted to, they can pick one they want to use. They can say, I want to use this one, or they can get assistance with that. So there are some different ways around that. I mean, there's so many parts of your product that we don't use well that it's a big leap for us. I mean, we're not, most of us are using Microsoft Office for Calendar. We're not using your Calendar. We're not sending up reminders in there, which are all really good things. And you guys have thought through really well, and I know it works well. It's just our people haven't been using it. So it is still a little bit of a jump for them, but, you know, it's not crazy. And the young people, I think, will jump on right away. Okay. That's a big one. Younger people generally do go a little bit quicker with this and like it a lot. Yeah, they're the ones pushing for the new stuff all the time, which is good. I used to be one of those, so I still respect that. But they're just pushing me now. Yeah. Okay, anything else that you want to show me? I think I got a pretty good idea. That is it. That is it. Any other questions or anything like that? No, I don't think so. I think I got to look into SendGrid. I think I need to look into that for sure. Then we'll get back to you. All right. Yeah, let me know if you have any interest in that, and I can help you get that set up, send over paperwork, or answer any other questions. Maybe I'll circle back into the week or just if I haven't heard. Sure. Yeah, you're welcome to do that. Just so you know, Jim, I don't remember that we've spoken, but I think you've been there a long time. 26 years, yep. We've worked with your product forever. We like it a lot. It's always done very well for us, and we appreciate all the help you guys always give us. Fantastic. Yeah, we appreciate you. And, yeah, anything you need, I'm here. I've been here a real long time, so I'm happy to help you. Yep. Well, thank you. All right. Well, thank you both. I will talk to you soon. Yep. All right. Okay. Take care. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
