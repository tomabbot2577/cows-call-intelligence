    "text": " Hi, this is Robin. Well, hey, Ms. Robin. It's Tom Zalany calling from Denver. How are you? I am well, thank you. How's your Monday morning looking? Oh, pretty good. It's Monday afternoon now. Yeah, not too bad. Well, excellent. I was wondering if you or someone else might be able to help me import a CSV file because I'm getting an error message. It says the source to destination field mapping dictionary is required. And I don't know what that means. Oh, I'd have to see that. I haven't heard of that before. Anything odd in your file name? No. Not that I know of. Okay. Can you send me the file real quick? Sure. Okay. It is going to be Robin, R-O-B-I-N, at mainsequence.net. I'm just going to look at... Actually, you know what? Don't even bother with that. Hold on. Trying to think. That error. What would that mean? I shouldn't send you a meeting. Meeting. Okay, I just sent you a meeting link. Okay. So when you click on it, you don't need to join with audio or use your camera. But we will share screen once you're in. Okay. Well, let's see, edit, password, copy, paste. So I'm going to have you, you can turn off camera, but hit share screen. And then when you, when the share screen option pops up, go over to the right where it says entire screen and then pick which screen to show. Okay, let's see. Oh, can you do entire screen? Looks like you didn't share entire screen. So if you do stop presenting, do share screen, then go over to the right and that pop-up where it says entire screen? Oh, gotcha. Otherwise, it only shows me like a portion. Let's do this one. OK. So show me one of the files. So it's a CSV. OK. No double spaces anywhere or anything like that, right? No, it's just that's what it says. And then... And it saved as a CSV comma delimit. Can you open the file up? Yeah, this is the error request that I got. The mapping dictionary is required to be sourced. Okay. And these are names? Yes. Okay. Let's go back to your database. Let's start the import over. All right. So we are importing a list. And we're doing names. Okay. And you pick your roll-up list. I actually do it right from the roll-up but now there are names in that list yes okay so I'm I'm trying to add more names to that list okay so file to import let's click on that so it's 1185 Chris Ruth contains headers. Do you want to fill in empty city-state? No. Okay. No double spaces. Okay, let's hit next. Go to the field mapping, like expand that. Okay, I just hit next. I didn't do any of the field mapping. Oh, that's probably why then. I probably didn't know where to put it. Okay. So first name, last name. I think that's everything. thing like they probably have like phone numbers or email anything like that you got to map all of that you got to tell where to go this is what it looks like so first thing last name city state title work yeah you're gonna have to map all that stuff okay okay well maybe that's what I was doing wrong let me just do that real quick. Oops, add candidate wizard, title. So those are the predefined PCR fields and then here what you're seeing is what's the column heading in your file. So you got to do title, current title to title. Okay. And go down to city and state you have that yep and then do you want them in a company record or just put them into your default we'll put them into the current title let me just look at this if you click in a drop down you see what's in your file. I think you had company name so it's just do you want a company record for that company? Well I think what ends up happening is when we we say add companies if they're already in the system then it'll make duplicates so I'll just say no. Well it just it well it depends if you map to pound company name if there's a record that's spelled exactly the same then it'll put it into that company if it doesn't find one then it creates one so if they are kind of off in the spelling that could create one right right um okay so i won't i will not do company okay what else is in the file because then they just go to your default company we've got the linkedin url uh that you cannot map to our field unless you change the name of it which means you're also going to have to redo this import because the profile url you You want that to be called social underscore LinkedIn. Okay. Capital S underscore and then capital L and then capital I. And then what you'll do is you'll map it to the custom field. And since there's already a custom field called social underscore LinkedIn, it'll put it into the existing field. Okay. I'm just going to leave that out because that sounds like it could be really complicated. No, no, just here. We'll just go out, minimize this. We'll just clean up your file first. All right. Just go ahead and close this out. Okay. And then open your file back up. Okay. So anything that has to go to a custom field, you have to make sure the column is named exactly the name of the custom field. So instead of profile URL, put social underscore. And then LinkedIn, but make sure the L and the I are capitalized. Okay. Work phone, we have a field for that. Personal phone, I guess that's cell phone. Now, we only have one email address field. anything else would have to be custom so I see you have a kind of a mix what do you use on your records on a name record can you show me a name record it would be like a home home email yeah but show me a name record let's see what you use Okay. Email home, email to, email work, email work to. Okay. And what would you put in the primary field? Primary would be email address. Well, which one? Would it be the work or the... Generally speaking, it would be work. Okay. So when you're in your layout, if you go up here at the top right, looks like you may not have a pen but go to the three-lined icon no no no top right of the record not of the search area go in to customize so this is going to show you your layout okay so any so see how I had you name the column social underscore LinkedIn because that's the name of the custom field okay you would have to label your fields email underscore home email underscore work because those are custom fields only predefined email address is a primary built-in one okay so you have to go to your file oh okay got it okay so work email that has to be email underscore home and then the other one has to for work email that has to be email underscore work and we don't have a field for feedback on a name record unless you have a costume field so probably better just take it off then just makes it easier okay okay all right so resave your file and just hit save so it updates your changes Okay, let's go back to the import. Now, because we're, if you decided you don't want to map to the company, then these would all go in your default. Is that what you want to do? Yes, that's fine. All right, so go to start. Go to your file upload option. Go to your file upload option. Pick your roll-up list. And then generic. Okay. File to import. Now do you want to check the option fill empty city, state, or zip code fields? Basically what that'll do is if you have a city and state it'll pull in the zip code. now okay yes I'm where there's like many zip codes like right you know bigger cities it'll just be kind of like geostat or whatever yeah that's fine sure or to get something then nothing yes I agree right hit next okay so now we're going to redo kind of what we were doing before so to the right of first name okay so that's last name so map those two first name and then last name is right above it and then you had title which is the second option up there Current title is up higher. Down lower now. A little bit of a delay. Oh, there it is. Got it. Okay. Then do your city and state. Okay. And then you're going to scroll down to the phone fields. They're right after the company. I think you had work phone, cell phone, or at least something similar. It's predefined. The field name doesn't matter as much. It's custom fields where it does. So here you're going to pick work phone. And then you're going to do your cell phone. and then you're going to scroll down and you'll see like custom one through 20. So there, that's where you're going to have to map your social underscore LinkedIn because those are custom fields. So since it's going to find a field that gets exactly that name, it'll put it into the existing field rather than creating a whole new field. Okay. That's why it's good to look at the layout and make sure you're naming it exactly what you see in the customize area. Okay, then you're going to do email work, email home. And then notes is up a little bit higher from those. It's right above the three custom ones. Okay. Then you'll hit next. And this, it just depends on your database. Do you want to not do any duplicate checking? Just whatever's in your list, it just puts it into the database. Skip or update if duplicate found? We'll update. Okay and what would be, do you want to do it based on first name, last name, work phone? Yes. okay like you want to pick whatever you have the most of probably first name last name company name well that's gonna be tricky because you are putting everything into the default okay you're right okay and then hit import okay okay excellent well I will do that with my other two CSV files and I did not realize I had to map all of the locations. And now that you've expanded that, the next time you go in, it'll remember that it's expanded. So you'll see that next time. Oh, okay. Excellent. Okay. Well, thank you, Robin. I appreciate that. This has been a learning process for me. I'm going to go through and do the same thing for the other two CSVs that I have, and we'll move onward enough. All right. Well, have a great week. Thanks, you too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
