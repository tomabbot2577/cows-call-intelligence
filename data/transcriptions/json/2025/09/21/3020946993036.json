    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? I've got another hopefully easy question for you. Yeah, no problem. Hey, so what you're saying is it's basically a duplicate name or duplicate email address? What are you saying as far as why it showed that way? A duplicate name. So it's not saying that there's duplicate records. It's each record can only be on one specific roll-up list once. So that would be a duplicate first name, last name? I guess I'm trying to figure out what is it. Just the same record. So it's saying that specific name record is already on this roll-up list. So wouldn't that be the same as the duplicate record? No, that's the reason why it can only be on a roll-up list once, is so it doesn't display as a duplicate. it's saying hey you've already added this record to the roll-up list and that's why we you can't add it again because it's already there but it's a brand new roll-up list just created like you just yeah i literally just created a roll-up list called all quality and what i did the search on anything with the title quality because my intent was to go through and export it and then and then look at it see exactly what i had you know working with that because you have to put something to roll up before you can export it correct correct yeah so i created a brand new roll-up called all quality after i did my all quality search in the title anything with the the word quality in it. And like I said, it was about 3,000 name difference. And I thought, damn, when you said that first, I'm going like, oh, well, maybe that was bad. Actually, I didn't think to ask what is that based on. I was assuming. Well, how many records did it say it added? 5,000 something. Okay, because there's 8,337 records on that list. I'm confused now because when I was looking at that called you let me see here you know what you're right that's even more bizarre because it showed it showed records added and it showed records ignored that's what I called you I've never seen that that before and I thought well that's weird especially a brand new roll-up right but that windows now gone so I see what you're saying it's like now showing 83 37 and if I just do a quick just like I did before idle quality search it also could have been a timing issue or that screen just timed out. You know what? Because I just did that search again. That shows 8337. All right. I'm sorry I bothered you. I've seen that happen too. Where it times out on that loading screen and it'll say ignored. But it's actually adding them. It just doesn't display it right on that screen. Oh, I got you. I got you. I got one more question for you. I know you all changed the summary feature on records. And so you got a lot more choices to play with. But it's almost like it's HTML or something. Because like, for example, sometimes I'll copy stuff in. And, you know, if I've got it written up in Word or something and I'm writing a summary for somebody and I'll copy it in. And then the, what do you call it, the spacing is wonky. But I don't see any way to adjust the line spacing in this under summary. Is there a way to do that? What do you mean by the line spacing? Well, like say, for example, if you're in a Word document, you know, and you copy stuff or you write a bunch of different – or you copy and paste stuff into the Word document from different resources and you turn around and say, or you change it all to one type of font and one type of font size, sometimes you can adjust how – if you hit enter and go to the next line, you could have a one point or one and a half point or two point space between each run. So that's like a word specific thing. Yes. But once you put it in the summary and it's wrong. I played one the other day for 30 minutes. I was ready to pull my hair out because I couldn't get the spacing right. What else could I do? Unfortunately in ours there's no way to do that. Oh well. Okay. So what's your alternative, just putting it back all in Word, writing it up, and then putting it in there the way you want? Yes, you can always do that. Okay. Because I just got to – before, like I said, it was – I could copy and paste from a bunch of different sources, information I would manipulate into what I wanted it to look like, but it would automatically space everything out nice and even and kept it all the same font. I didn't have to worry about that. Yeah, now it's kind of – now it's like an HTML editor. Because you have that AI feature now as part of the trial, the AI summary generator. How does that work? So if you're on the summary section, you'll see the button at the very, on the bottom, it's the last button on the bottom. Uh-huh. Take a little star pattern with this AI generator, yeah. Yep, so you would just go to the summary section, click that, you'll get a prompt. It says it'll overwrite current text if there's text there, but if you don't have anything there, you just hit OK. So basically, it will just turn around and rewrite what you wrote, or is that what we're hearing, or give you a different version of it? It'll give you a different version based on their record. okay okay well that answered two of my questions so i think i'm done for the day man all right not a problem talk to you soon have a good one butch bye",
