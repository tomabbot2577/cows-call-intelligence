    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Jake with Sanford Rose IT. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. I'm doing well. I've got a weird question that I might have to call back for because I've got a team meeting in 10 minutes. But I've got Allison Boyce in here, and she's asking a question that, like I said, I don't really know how to answer. So they're hitting a slowdown because they have to jump between roll-ups to keep track of the latest status. and relative last touch dates between contacts. She tried a few things, but she doesn't think she's using correctly. Is there someone that can help us a better way to track roll-up statuses or one central location to track them? So, yeah, the roll-up statuses are specific to each roll-up. So I guess you can go to a name record and look at the roll-ups tab on that name record, and it'll show all the roll-ups they're in with their status next to it. But besides that, you'd have to open up each roll-up list to know what status people are at. Okay. So it sounds like the product wasn't designed to do that on a high level. it's just going to have to deal with what it's supposed to do. Yeah, it's just inside the roll-up is where the statuses live. They don't really live outside of the roll-up. Gotcha, gotcha. All right, that was all I needed to know. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't going to give wrong information. All good, yeah. No, that's good. Yeah, just let us know if any other questions come up around that. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
