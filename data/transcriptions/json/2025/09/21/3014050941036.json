    "text": " Good morning, Main Sequence. Hello there, Jim. This is Mark Dillon. How are you doing? I'm well, Mark. How are you? I'm good. I was wondering if you could do me a favor. At the moment now, it is only myself with Natec. And can you verify to see how many users that I now have? Yeah, let me pull that up there. And what I'm paying. Okay, it looks like we have you listed at two users at 95 per user per month. So that's how many you're listed at now. But if you need to change it, I can do it today. I can put in a ticket, have them drop you down to two. Yes, if you don't mind doing that. And now I have, and I'm looking at, and I just wanted to verify, because I had my daughter helping me out, and she was full-time. And now she's wrapping things up. And I have all, you know, access because she was doing a lot of the admin, behind the scenes admin stuff, and she was the admin. But for me to have all that, there's really nothing I need to do, right, on my end. I still would have all the, if I go to NPCR and look at my user, I am the, even though she was a system administrator, Or actually I do have a system administrator and then I have Lauren. Oh, no, that's that's somebody else So how does that work? So you should have admin permissions under your username? But the admin username is also there with the admin permissions if you forget your password or anything like that the admin usernames They're no cost. So if you need to log into that that one's there It looks like logging in right now is MED and admin are the two that are logging in relatively regularly Okay, gotcha, gotcha. Okay, yeah, so at this point, it's just going to be myself, and as long as I have all the admin features, because I'm doing it, I'll just want to make sure we're good. Yeah, you should be good. I'll put in the ticket to get you dropped to one user. You should notice that whenever the next charge happens, it will only be for one. And if you need anything else or you need to add users down the line, just let me know. No, and all good. And there is a tutorial on the AI, because I'm playing around with it, but I just want to make sure I'm using it to, you know, be on the phone. Yeah, let me email it to you. I'll email you. There's a video. It's a detail. I'll email over to you in a little bit here that has some information about that. Thank you, Jim. For sure. All right. Have a great day. You too, sir. Take care. Bye-bye.",
