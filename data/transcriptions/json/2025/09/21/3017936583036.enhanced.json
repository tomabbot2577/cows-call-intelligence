    "text": " this is Cheryl hi Cheryl this is Robin Montoni with a huge apology I get it I was like oh this just isn't seeming right and so I don't do it monthly because I don't have any income yet yeah I'm just doing a catch-up I'm like oh this isn't right yeah so I think here's what happened um when we switched our billing system at one point you went to like basically like an auto pay which really wasn't kind of supported so they had to do it when we switched on the new billing system is they had to make an invoice for you but they used like the original one i had to look up where you had your like split over two yeah and i'm like no this is always so i just called the bookkeeping people i said this is these last ones from i think i think let's see what my look my dates here so december and january 19th those are supposed to be the 425 where it was split up over two but anything from february 19th on was only supposed to be 50 per month correct yep i have fixed it for your next one and then what she's going to do she's doing like a credit so she has So where it's paid the June one and it's going to pay, she went ahead and generated the basically the July one. And then she's going to apply that credit. So what that's going to do, it's going to leave $650 a difference. And she's going to refund that back to you. So your next invoice, once she's done with all this, let me see if she's even got it going so far. Your, okay, now she's got that. Okay, it keeps changing it. she's working on it so she's refunding the 650 back to you your June and July will both be generated like so you're getting that July one just a couple days earlier so she could apply that payment yeah and then your next one would not be until August and that one is 100% now set at 50 okay got it okay perfect I really apologize if this happened um I know especially when you're dealing with systems, I'm like, oh, and they switched. Like, it now comes from PCR and not main sequence. I bet they had a system change or something. Well, actually, the newer invoices will say main sequence again. Oh, they will? Okay. Yeah. Well, main sequence is the company. Peace Recruiter is the product. So when you have, you know, we kind of use them interchangeably. So people are actually paying, and you can't switch it for, like, the accounting. So we're like, you had to put it back. and we just put like I think Peace Recruiter by Main Sequence at least some people see that like yes Peace Recruiter is a product Main Sequence is a company yeah I knew what it was either way yeah so we're all good it looks like she is getting this done so now one thing you need to figure out she might when she tried to do one of them she might have to do it in two refunds okay that's fine I'll just let it shake out and we'll see where we're at in August yeah so this should be like you really should not do anything for June or July and then you're getting 650 back because those are okay and then definitely the August is set for 50. Okay sounds great thank you so much for the call I really appreciate it and for looking into it right away. Oh yeah thank you for catching that that was yeah that was really bad okay all right have a great day you too thank you all right yep bye-bye.",
