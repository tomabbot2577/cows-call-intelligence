    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by your name. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hey there, Jim. Hello. How are you? Can you hear us okay? Yeah. Do you hear me all right? Yeah. Now we can. Excellent. Excellent. I'll pop on my screen here. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning to you too. All right. Yeah, so thanks for joining me very much. Wanted to introduce myself and PC Recruiter. And you all are a new dimensional search office, I've gathered. And are you part of the class on the 6th of October? I think we're going to move it to November, just because there's probably not enough time to do all the application trainings we need. Sure, sure. Yeah, we, um, you would want to usually our training team will get you two sessions prior to that time. I actually talked to two other offices in the same class yesterday. So they're still getting signed and paid and everything. So they're trying to do it. But with them also trying to do it. Maybe if it's better for you, it might might make sense to switch to November. When is that class, by the way, do you know? I think it's also November 6. Okay. November 6th. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Which means, you know, probably if your team, if your training team is preoccupied, then come post-October 6th, things should be a bit more available, right? Which would also work well because then we still have about four weeks before the November intake. Certainly. Certainly. And they like to get, I think they generally go for two sessions prior to the dimensional search training. Okay. So that should give plenty of time for that. So as you know, PC Recruit is the software that you use. It comes with dimensional search. They train on it, and essentially you'll have our whole training team and their whole training team kind of training on everything from software to recruiting to general and everything like that. So it works pretty well. What I do today is just kind of go over that general process, which you already knew that process there. I would also collect your company name, address, all of that information to put together the paperwork so I can send that to RUVU once you're ready to get moving. You can sign that with DocuSign. The initial payment is the setup, which is $750. So $750. That includes the setup, database creation, and up to 10 hours of training with a trainer. And then $50 per user per month. And are you going to be one user, two users to start? We're going to be one. We'll start out with one. If I remember correctly, there is also like an admin user in addition to the general user, right? And I think that's probably sufficient for now until we decide to grow our team. for sure yeah the admin user is there and it's it's like you like you said free of charge and it is something you can use for occasional access data entry looking and stuff like that if it gets to be that you're using regularly everyday sending emails doing interviews and something you want to add a paid user but certainly for now you can use that admin user have you used before you familiar with PC recruiter at all no both first-timers yeah so so that is Good. And like I said, so it's 50 bucks per user per month, $7.50 one time. To get set up, it's $800 to set up in the first month. Yeah. And do you have any questions? Or I'll collect your company name and address and everything so I can put that together and have that sent over. Sure. I think the company name and address and all that I replied by email. Just check my latest one because I made a typo with the company name. It should be Doctus and not Duke. Duke is a funny typo. We are also getting ready to buy laptops. And so what I wanted to know is, is PCR web hosted or does it need to be installed onto each user's laptop? And also the system requirements. I know what kind of specs are required to run the program. Sure, sure. So it is totally cloud based. So there's nothing that's really going to be installed on your laptop except for a small launch. I think they call it a launcher. So there's a small launcher, and that would be just a little like Java control pack or something like that. So not a lot at all. No data is kept on your machine or anything like that. Pretty much anything is going to run on a PC or a Mac, so that doesn't matter. Not a Chromebook. So some people want to buy a Chromebook, can't do it on a Chromebook. So that's one thing to know. And really, any computer you buy today is going to be more than enough to run it because it's all cloud-based, just like logging onto your Gmail. So it's pretty simple. So that's going to be pretty much easy there. Okay. Now, going back to the agreement that you're going to be preparing, from the time that you send it to me, is there going to be some kind of expiration date by which I should sign it? Or is it – I think 30 days. When we send it, I think by default it gives you 30 days to sign it there. Okay. Then – so explain to me a little bit more. So now getting into the details and the process. So let's say I sign the document. What are we looking at in terms of time to get access and also, you know, the training? When is the earliest? How do we book that? Like, is there a calendar where we can check availabilities or is that something that you'll speak to your training teams about and provide it with some dates? Well, yeah. So what happens to timing? I would put together the paperwork, send that over. once it's signed usually that same day or at latest the next day I counter sign it put in the request for my accounting team to send the invoice and that is sent so that usually happens same or next day from when you sign the agreement okay once that invoice is paid then one to two business days is kind of what we allow to get the database link created so one two business days after payment received they would email you do them the link to your database the admin username and password and that's going to be your life database so that's ready to go. They also would, as that's created, the ticket I put in to create that database, as soon as my tech creates the database, they send it over to my training team. Then my training team takes another maybe day or two to get you assigned to a trainer. Then I'm cc'd on that email that lets you know who your trainer is. And then I would reach out to coordinate a call between you and me and the trainer, introducing them. They usually have, I think eight or ten questions to go over talking about your setup, your hardware, your email, how you're going to use it, being dimensional search, like we know you need RingCentral, HireEasy, so we know some of the basics, but they'll have a few questions, and then at the conclusion of that call, they'll go ahead and get the first two training sessions on the schedule right then and there. They'll kind of compare schedules with you, get the first couple, usually within the first couple of weeks after that, and so that'll happen right then and there, and then you'll have their contact information to contact them direct if and when you're ready for additional training, if you need anything, if you have any questions or anything of that nature. Okay. Any questions from you, Ben? Okay. I think it's good. So thanks for this introductory call. It's pretty clear. So I will just, I think the next step, sir, we'll just wait for the agreement from your side. Certainly. And I don't have an email from you. When did you send that over? uh two days ago perhaps okay two days ago maybe yeah september 16 at 4 12 p.m eastern time i've got it here let's see oh well i see the email i sent you but i don't have an email back I don't have that I just have a sent email I have one on the 16th at 9 a.m. just about your availability so I didn't get that could you forward that again please for some reason it didn't show yeah because I was checking I use my email inside a PC recruiter but I also hop directly into my gmail direct and it didn't show there oh my apologies Jim this was to a different Jim yeah so you're right I haven't provided any information so I I yeah well that's good to No, I hadn't listed a wrong email or anything like that, so no worries. But, yeah, send me that along, and then as soon as I have that, I'll email everything over. Probably this morning, I've got like four more calls going on today, so in between those, I'll get that sent over. Okay, and just a quick recap. So you need the company name, the company address, and what else in addition to that? So company name, street address, contact phone number for you, and an email if it's different than the one I have on file. and I have okay let's see I have a gmail we can change that later so the dimensional it is still setting up all of our yeah we have a domain um uh claimed you know but they still need to set up the email and everything so I'm going to assume that I can always change the email address that's used for communication and log in. Is that right? Absolutely. Absolutely. And you can change it. I'll send it to the Gmail for now, but as soon as you get that address, I'll change it in our systems. The trainer can easily help you change it in your database. So that can all be changed for sure. Okay. This is perfect. Thank you. Very well. Well, as soon as I get that, I will let you know there, then I'll get everything sent over today. And then any other questions, let me know. And I'm always going to be a main point of contact if you need to add users, have any account questions, or if there's anything you need, you don't know who to talk to, come to me and I can get you to the correct person here. Okay. Understood. Thank you, Jim. So expect an email from me and thanks for your time, Jim. Excellent. Thank you both for the time. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye now.",
