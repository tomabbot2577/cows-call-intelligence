    "text": " Thank you for calling eTech High. If you know your party's extension number, you may dial it at any time. For the operator, please press 0. eTech High, this is Chrissy. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail that you have some questions about PCR. Yes. Hi, Garrett. Thanks for calling me back. No problem. I'm trying to work in PCR, and all I've ever done is actually use PCR to send out roll-ups with a CSV imported. I've never worked with the actual database in there in order to send a roll-up out to existing database contacts. And so I'm kind of in the dark on how to find what I'm looking for in PCR. And I'm not, like, totally inexperienced in it, but I can't figure out, like, with our companies. I'm trying to find, like, we have, like, three different categories, but I don't know how to find those categories. I just know they exist because everybody who used to work in this is gone. Oh, I see. Okay. I haven't been able to get formal training with any processes. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, let me pull up your database really quick. So usually you can categorize. Let's see. You can categorize records with certain field level data. So, you know, anybody with the first name Mike, I could do a search and find field level things like that. Or there's other tabs on records, things like keywords that make them more searchable later on. Other softwares might call them tags. So if you do, do you know of like an example of a categorization that you're looking for? So we, I have one thing in a manual that is the only reference to this kind of thing. It says categories and companies and it says default company and then there's available client company and vendor. Oh, okay. That is a specific. Yeah, that makes sense. So, yeah, there's a specific field on every company record, and it's called the default company type. And there's those four options. The client company is a way to, when you select that, you're designating this company record as one of your clients. You're actively, you know, filling job orders for them. when it's more of a company record in your database that you maybe plan to reach out to and don't have a relationship with yet you switch that over to available and then vendor is more like you just want their contact in your database but they're maybe providing a service for you so it could be like our company main sequence is your software provider so maybe we'll be in your database as a vendor and then default company that one's special in pcr you should only have one company record designated as your default company and you probably already have one in your database i could check to see what it's called right now but it's kind of just like a catch-all um where you know every name record in pcr has to be attached to a company record so if they don't have a company to go to you put them in to the default database it's generally how you would do default is like everybody and then under that they could be these three Heather categories we were talking about well defaults kind of separate separate from the other three so you'll only have one company that's listed as your default that's your catch-all company that names can go to but the other three yeah it just depends are they a client or not okay so I see the categories under basic search and like so we're saying in theory available should just be non non-client clients okay so that yeah that makes sense because that's 6600 entries and then if I go I don't know how to go back do I go back or do I just hit company again you can hit company again if you hit basic search underlined it'll retain your criteria so you don't have to start over building out your search or you can hit company at the top if you want to just start over fresh okay so in here just so you know what I'm looking at in case you're not actively in my little database here under default company I have available default client and vendor so they created a category under default company called default company yeah the name the The name of the field is default company type, but maybe the word type is getting cut off. Okay. But, yeah, that's like a standard thing that comes with PCR, that specific field. Yeah, and I looked at it, and it says there's 17. So that's probably not something we were actively using per se. Oh, okay. Yeah, you should really only have one default company. So maybe those got switched at some point over to default accidentally, some of those 17. I just pulled open your database here. Oh, yeah. So you do have one company called Candidate Pool. That's a common name people will give for their default company because it's just a general candidate pool where people sit when they have no other company to be associated with in your database. I think the other companies besides Candidate Pool should eventually be switched to something like Available or even Client if they're a client. I don't know I don't see anywhere to go to candidates where do you see that so that's up at the top it's under name yeah those are all your candidates will be name records okay I don't care about candidates because we're not using this database anymore for active work this is all old records we've been on a different database for two years but we've maintained this because we value all the the way the data is in here and we value the roll-up tool in here so So what I've been tasked, because I'm admin, so I'm not a recruiter, is to create a blast for, if you look, since you are in my database, under default company and available, which is the ones that are non-contracted in what you're explaining to me, which matches what my little note says. I just didn't even know how to get here, honestly. and then the other two categories, the client company, which are companies that we have contracted and worked with. Vendor would be that last one, people who are just providing a service for you. So vendor, I think we have contracts with them, but we have never really done anything with them, like gotten anything done or something like that. Oh, okay. That's a mixed bag for us. We have to really clean that up. Again, I'm working in a different ATS, so we rely on this because we imported everything from here into the new one, but it didn't go in cleanly at all. So I'm trying to make sense of it. And in the meantime, I want to get a blast out to that big number, that 6,600, where we just have some records that may or may not have emails that are still valid that we'd like to send an email out to to pitch them. So that would be the, I think that's for us, that's available. Yeah, that's a 6600. Okay, well, at least I figured out how to find it. And so, because I do know how to create roll-ups, I just have never created roll-ups from the database. So once I have that list here, then I can just select all and do a letter. Add to roll-up. And do all that. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And the company records, they might not have an email address to reach out to. I'm not sure how you do it. Right. I don't know that until I play in there. Yeah. Yeah. But go ahead. I was just going to say the contacts at your company, like the hiring authorities, those would be name records as well. So name records aren't just for candidates. It's for also your contacts at the client. So it might be that you want to create a list of companies, and if the email is stored there, you can do a blast to those companies. But sometimes you actually have to create a list of name records that are your client hiring authorities. I have a situation because a lot of this, when we moved it out into a different ATS, the email addresses and the people didn't transfer properly. And so, yeah. But in your database, the way the previous employees created it, they always put an email address in for the company. They didn't know. Oh, that's helpful. Yeah. They didn't always put the people in. So the company, since we don't have an actual relationship with them, it's practical for us to just blast it all in, whichever ones have email addresses, we'll go through is what I'm theory thinking. So for you, for real quick, this shouldn't take long, because like I said, I'm familiar with creating a roll up and I'm familiar with. but what I usually do is import my CSV and since I won't be doing that to let's say I'm going to do a blast of the 6000 and select all and now I just look at it I took it out I didn't click the right thing so this is available search okay so I'm not going to do it but in theory I would select all here do I need to create my roll-up first or can I create a new roll-up from that? Yeah, you can from your search results, you can do an email blast right here with the action menu. It's usually at the top right handful of icons there. One of them will be a letter icon to email blast them or you can Oh, go ahead. Or you could put them in a roll-up list with the little notebook icon if you want to set aside in its own roll-up list. I see. So if I wanted a record of this act that I'm going to do, since we don't do it very often and we might want to see when did we do it last, would it be better for me to create a roll-up and then add these entries into it? Yeah, that would be good. So you have them all together on the date that you sent it. So yeah, find the, it's a notebook icon in the action menu at the top right. And then that's where you can. right and then I just create a new roll up so I can do that let's say let's I'm not going to actually send it out but that's okay and then once I create this roll up then it has zeros and then normally because I'm importing it I would just click that zero and then go into the menu for import so for here since I don't need to import it what would be the next step obviously you would see in that pop-up at the bottom right is an add roll-up button after you have clicked on the little notebook icon so I don't let you name it I added a roll-up I named it test blast even though I'm not so I have a test blast that has zero names in it all right and then just click on the zero it'll start loading in the total number of search results into that roll-up list okay so I So I did not use my entries to create this rollup. I just did it from scratch. I didn't have those people selected. So let's say I'm where I am now. So I have a rollup I've created with no entries in it. Is there a way to go get those to import them from my database into this rollup? How would I do that? So you would go back to performing your company search. So you'll go back to company up at the top. and then use your drop downs in the basic search to find everybody with the specific status okay I did that and then once you hit search you'll be able to do select all results at the top left of your results and then click on the little notebook icon at the top right the notebook icon inside the search right Roll-up companies as opposed to roll-ups. Yeah. Very, very tough. Okay. Exactly. Roll-up companies. And then you can click the zero next to the new roll-up that you created. And I'm going to click the zero that's under company or added or ignored. Company. Okay. And it will start loading those in. Okay. Yeah. All right. I think that's the basic steps. So search, select all, and then the roll-ups within search. And then it will automatically import them. And then I know how to do the letter part. So that's awesome. I appreciate your help. I appreciate you calling me back so quickly because it only took you, what, five, ten minutes, and now this is the task I needed to do. And I know it wasn't hard, but I didn't know how to do it. So I appreciate it. Yeah, happy to help. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, reach out if you do run into any other questions. Okay, do you have a direct line just because we do have a relationship or an email? I don't need urgent help, but just because I am new to this and I'm not sure if they'll ask me to do something new. Oh, you could ask for me. If you just call our support line, you could ask for me and say, can I speak to Garrett? Okay. That would work. And is the support line what I ended up calling? Yeah, that's how we got your voicemail. Okay, great. Awesome. Thank you so much, Garrett. I hope you have a great day, and you definitely helped and made my day. Awesome. Thanks so much. Have a great day as well. All right. Take care. Bye-bye.",
