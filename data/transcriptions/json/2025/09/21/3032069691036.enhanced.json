I noticed that you've got credentials in 735. Is there a way that you could reach out to Ed and see if we could hop on a quick call together so I can 2FA into that account. Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Let me see what my availability is today. Got a training 930, 1130. Even if you just give him a call right now and then merge me in. Okay, yeah, I'll try to give him a call, see if he's... Available one second. Yeah. Just loop me into the call if he's available. All right. Sounds good. I'll call you back in a second. All right. Thanks, Garrett. All right. Bye.",
