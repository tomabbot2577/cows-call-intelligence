    "text": " Hi, this is Rob Warren. I'm sorry I'm unable to take your call, but please leave me your name and number, and I'll call you back as quickly as possible. Thank you. Hello, Rob. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a call. I got your ticket in our help desk system that said you're looking to terminate your PC Recruiter account shortly after your retirement at the end of the month. So I wanted to follow up with you on that. Yes, we can send you a backup. It will be a SQL database you can download from a link that we'll make available. there's a cost of $175 on that and there's a formula you need to fill out as well. So what I will do, let me go ahead and get the ticket in and start it just so we have it in queue here. I'm going to put the cancellation date like maybe September 30th. We can change that if needed, but I'll at least get it in queue, get you in here. They can get you the paperwork to get the data return if you want that and stuff like that. But give me a call if you have any other questions or anything like that it can help work through the process but a ticket i'll put in and then my admin team will reach out to kind of actually start the process there my direct is four four zero eight five six zero three one four that's four four zero eight five six zero three one four thanks",
