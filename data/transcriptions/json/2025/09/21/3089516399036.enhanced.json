    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah, Tyler, how are you today? Good. How are you? Good. My name is Michael Parrott with Parrot God Recruiters. This is probably a really simple thing, but for the last few weeks, we can't figure it out. So we have a contact, and this contact is currently working at a company. So we have, well, we break things down. But anyway, she's technically like a client, okay? However, she wants to get out of there, wants to, you know, look for a job, whatever. So I wanted to duplicate her existing contact and put the other one into default for candidates. so basically we have a lot of the same information already filled out like her like her home and her cell and things like that so how do I do that how do I create a new you're not really supposed to create a duplicate record I would just move the current record to default for candidates but we want to leave it in client because she is she's still at that company so she's not going to leave until she finds a job um that is why we want to essentially have so the only way that you can do like a duplicate is if you have like a personal email and cell phone yes like both records can't have the same phone numbers and emails on them because that's going to mess up activity tracking because it can it'll only write to one record right and they won't so one is right now we have okay so i created some other fields when i set this up, I don't know, whatever it was, 10, 12 years ago, 15 years ago. And so I made some custom fields. And so it's like one of them is called email home, email other. But the email address, the default, is her current work address. Is her current work email? Yes, yes. So the other one will not have that. Perfect. yeah the only one you're really concerned about is email address because that's what the system looks for like you know that and cell phone yeah telephone okay yeah what it checks for duplicates okay so i just want to create a whole new contact with the information that's in there then i will go and move some things around. Yeah, just keep all the work stuff on one and all the personal stuff on the other, and you should be fine. Yeah, because when we create a roll-up and we do a mailing, we don't want to send it to her work email. We want to send it to her personal. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. so how do I got any ideas well yeah you just create a new record where it's the personal information on it and put that one in default for candidates oh so I can't copy the data over is what you're saying no no no no oh that's why I was trying to avoid oh gotcha gotcha no you can't just like copy a record oh okay there's there's no way to just like copy a record okay okay um does the link you would have to do a manual entry okay all right fair enough um second thing you guys this is a relatively new thing it's not a big deal i just thought maybe there was an easy way to get rid of this. But under this particular name record, there's over on the left, there's a column on it shows, I think, all the different social media things, you know, like X and LinkedIn, all that stuff. And most of these we never use. So I thought, is there a way to change that default, a system default to put in the ones that we actually use? No, it's either all or nothing all or nothing okay okay how do I make it nothing if I want so you would go in like you're customizing a name record layout okay okay and then there's an option up at the top that the social networking uh-huh then you'll have the option to hide or show the social network okay now is that carry over is that a global change or is that only for the local contact change it's like a per user change so that'll be for every username that you're looking at or for every record that you're looking at for name records Okay, how do I make this as a global thing? You would have to copy your name record layout to all the other users Oh, okay Okay Yeah, and if you wanted to get rid of it for company records You would have to go into a company record Customize that layout as well and then copy your name and company record layouts over to the other users. Okay, so there's nothing under like where you can go up into the system. There's nothing there that I could. I looked all through that trying to find something I couldn't find. To turn it off? No. No, it's a layout option. So it's per user. per user okay all righty well it's not worth doing that all right that sounds good let's see I think I had one other question is that quite all right I think that's it for now all right thank you so much You have a good day. You too. Take care. Bye-bye.",
