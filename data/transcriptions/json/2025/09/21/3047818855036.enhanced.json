First, I wanted to see how your PCRM trial was going. it was up early this month so we need to see if you're going to keep it or whatnot and I think we talked about that we had added up discount accounts normally 350 set up additional 10 bucks a month I think we were down to 250 set up 10 bucks more a month per user I have to do the 10 bucks more a month for users because it's a new product have to get a new contract but I'll still keep you on the same one year you're on now and we can work on that 250 set up if if you don't think you need any more training on it we might be able to get some help on that so let me know on that I can get your paperwork keep it or not if you don't want to keep it but I think you would judging by kind of our past conversations also with regard to elk I hadn't heard anything seen anything we will need the sign off in order to transfer that data so we have to find Lauren and get a sign off from her or we can't release the data so that is something there so you once we can do that then then I might say if you want to pay it to date and pay for the data data backup everything we can do that but we do need to sign off from Laura and we haven't been able to get a hold of her so give me a quick call let me know and also I think you were having a trouble logging in so one to make sure that was all well is good that was while I was out of town so give me a quick call back let me know what you're thinking on the PCR I'm the other items four four zero eight five six zero three that's 440-856-0314.
