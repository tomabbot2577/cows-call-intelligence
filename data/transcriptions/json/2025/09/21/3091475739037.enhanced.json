    "text": " Good afternoon, GPSG. Good afternoon. Is Sydney Britton available? This is she. Sydney, it's Jim Lombardo calling with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hi, I'm good. How are you? I'm well. I just wanted to give a quick callback follow, see if you got my follow-up. I got buried. I was out of the office, so I got a little behind, but I wanted to check in and kind of see what you were thinking, if you had any further questions about PC Recruiter or what. Oh, no worries. Yes, I got your email, and I forwarded it to our IT team. and we actually have one more demo that got pushed out because our VP of Talent Acquisition has been out. So we have that demo on the 23rd, and then we're meeting sometime later that week to decide how we want to proceed. Okay. So by Friday next week, you should hear from me with an answer. Sorry, it's been delayed a little bit, but we definitely are still interested. Excellent. These things happen. That is no worries. I thank you for the update. And, yeah, let me know if there's anything more you need in the interim, and I may kind of ping you back later that Friday afternoon if I haven't heard anything from you by then. Perfect. Perfect. Sounds good. Thank you so much for the call. I appreciate it. My pleasure. Thank you. Have a good one. Bye. You too. Bye-bye.",
