It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call following up on your inquiry. I sent you an email, I think yesterday. I replied to a previous email from you about some questions and everything. Thought I'd follow up, see if I could interest you in a demonstration of PC Recruiter, show you how I might be able to help. Give me a call and let me know if that's something of interest to you. I'm happy to get it set up. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks, sir. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
