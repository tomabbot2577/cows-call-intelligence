    "text": " Hello? Hello, Dana? Hello, how are you doing? Is this the PC creator? This is, this is. jane lombardo yes yes what i was calling it was just going to an odd busy signal instead of a ring but then this time you picked up so i don't know what was going on it should just be an expectation yeah sometimes it would hang right up on me sometimes it would be an odd busy signal i but i'm glad i got you i'm sorry about that no problem no problem so i just wanted to kind of see what you were looking for in a software what sort of software do you need What are your main things you're looking for? And then we'll see a piece of recruiter might be a fit to look at a demo. We're just looking for hiring, something that was integrated to Indeed, just for hiring for a school. Okay, okay. And are you hiring for different schools or just the school board? No, just our school. No, just our school, just our school. Perfect, okay. so you want to post jobs to indeed and have something that's going to allow you to track candidates through an interview process that kind of the basics of what you're looking for okay that is that's just what we just what we do do you use anything right now I'm not at the moment okay and how many people do you have that would be utilizing it it's just gonna be me for now um I also wanted to know what's the prize in with you guys well the pricing probably our enterprise package might work for you pretty well and it's going to be about $95 per user per month and 500 bucks to set up so 500 bucks one time that includes creation of the database link that includes eight hours of training and kind of getting the system up and set up for you and then um $95 per user per month with a a one-year agreement and you can add or drop users if you wish so no problem there and that's going to include our base package which will allow you to enter your jobs your candidates track your interviews report on that we also offer if you wanted any mass communication options like you wanted like any the ability to send an email campaign so if you wanted to send a mass email and kind of see who opened it or who replied or anything like that and And then that also includes sequencing. So you could actually set up like a sequence that it would send an email to a group of people. And then if they opened it, maybe they're added to a call list. And maybe if they don't open in two days, it'll send another email or something like that, a little more automated. Does that sound like anything that might be of interest or not? It's OK, but it's quite expensive. Yeah, that one's a little more. Well, even the package with the email campaigns is like $1.15 per user per month and $7.50 to set up. Okay. Will I be able to talk to my team and we'll just get back to you? Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, let me know. You've got my email. If you have any questions or if you want to set up a brief demo, we can set up a time. It'll take maybe 30 minutes and look and see it firsthand and see what it does. and then we can even talk about if I can sharpen my pencil a little and get anything that might better fit your pricing. So give me a call. Let me know what you think. Okay. All right. No problem. I'm just going to get back to you on that. Okay. Very well. I will wait to hear and I'll circle back maybe in a couple days. All right. No problem. Have a good day. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
