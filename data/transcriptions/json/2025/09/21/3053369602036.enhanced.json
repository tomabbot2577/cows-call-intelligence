    "text": " Hello, this is Ed. Hi, this is Eric with Main Sequence Technology. I have a missed call from this number. Were you having trouble with PCR? I was trying to figure out how to download a bunch of stuff from Zoom into PCR. And I had another partner at my firm that was going to call you guys to get some help with that. So I think I'm going to let him do that. He's more techie than I am, but basically we've got ZoomInfo. They're connected, and we have like, you know, went on a website and found like 120 people. We're like, wow, this would be great if we just hit a click and sip. They all go into PCR, like into a roll-up. Does it do that? Yeah, so ZoomInfo actually has built the integration that can export in bulk from ZoomInfo over to PCR. So you would want to contact ZoomInfo, and they can help you set up that exporting feature. and answer any questions on the setup. But, yeah, that's something they built, so they'll be able to help you best with that. Okay, so there's no plug-in or anything that we need to just get in, and it works, but it seems like a pretty neat feature. So, okay, well, I didn't know who to call first. All right, well, that helps a lot. We will talk to them, but I thank you so much for the callback. Sounds great. Yeah, and let us know if any questions do come up. But, yeah, otherwise, have a great rest of your day. Okay, thanks. Bye.",
