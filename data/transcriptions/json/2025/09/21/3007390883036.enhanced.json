    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. I'm just going to go ahead and do that. Thank you. Good morning. Stacey, do you hear me? I can hear you. Can you hear me? I do. I do. Excellent. Yeah, you too. Okay. We have one more joining us? Yeah, DJ should be happening here. Awesome. Okay. Thank you. trouble getting on or what but you There he is. Okay. Can you hear me? Yeah. I can hear you. Jim, are you still there? I am. Okay. We're all here. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah. So, I wanted to kind of follow up. So, you're leaving SRA? We are. Yeah. 731. So we need to have that. Talk about our rates and where that leads us. Our current rate is $50 a month per user. And obviously we'd like to be able to stay at that same rate, especially being as we've been customers since 2021. For sure. For sure. well the um so yeah so obviously we we can't keep you at 50 because that's that's a discounted rate for sra and it's a three-year agreement and everything of that nature um but i'm going to do something to not have to the list price for what you're looking at on a one-year term is 115 per user per month uh so are you looking to kind of keep a two or three-year term what what were you thinking or go a shorter term I don't DJ do you have an answer to that no um for I would assume that we're not jumping shit to another service so um longer terms are okay yeah certainly certainly yeah well we we'd love to keep you uh and generally outside we don't usually do a three-year term outside of SRA so that was kind of how they bought that down so low by going with a longer term I have a couple of options for you kind of usually discounted rates I could if you want to go with like a one-year term I could probably get that at just 75 per user per month if you want to commit to a two-year term I could do 65 per user per month so just a $15 per user increase on that for a two-year commitment there I really can't go I certainly can't be at 50 and I can't go any lower than 65 really being that the list price on the white 15 and why is it that you only do a three-year with SRA that was negotiated through our owners and them years ago we had never done a three-year term for anyone before but I think that SRA wanted to get it to that $50 mark for the premium package so they were able they said if we can get everyone to commit for three years would you do 50 so that's literally the only people who get a three-year term is SRA for that $50. And that's not even on our priceless. We don't normally do a three-year term for anyone there. Okay. Yeah, it's wildly low. I don't think we make any money on it. It's a wildly low thing. It barely covers costs to do that. So that's why we Okay, gotcha. Okay. So prior to 731, we want to get a number, yeah. Yeah, we need to get a new contract in place. So just a new contract signed for however many users. Okay. So like I said, I could do one year at 75, two year at 65. and you're on premium I couldn't throw in the AI features as well in that normally they're an upgrade extra but I could include them at that as well so that'll come to no setup yes okay right no one no one time setup at all I think would change right yeah yeah okay yeah and your your URL does have sra in it but that doesn't really matter. We don't need to change that because nobody sees that, but your people who have it in their favorites and log in. So that wouldn't change. Your database name is Bridger Group, so that wouldn't change. Yeah, nothing would change. There's nothing proprietary you have that you need to get rid of. You don't have to leave or get rid of any features or templates or anything like that. So nothing would change and you don't have to leave us. So yeah, just the contract and pricing. And you're not even, you're Bridger Group, you're not an SRA-related name, so we would just pull you out of the affiliate issue with them in our lists here. Okay. All right. DJ, do you have any questions? I don't think I do. That pretty much explains everything. No, that pretty much explained everything. I mean, that shows. So, with the new potential price, you're basically stating an increase of $7,200 a year. if we use 40 people. An increase of, what did you say, how much a year? $7,200. And were you looking to pay monthly or pay annually? Had you given any thought to that? It looks like you were invoiced monthly now. A lot of times we'll do another 5% off of totals if you paid annually. And that just jogged my memory. So if you wanted to do like a two-year, pay it annually for the whole year, we knock 5% off of the total on the monthlies. So that might be a little bit more savings if you wanted to pay annually rather than monthly. I think that. How does that change when we have new people or lose people? generally what they'll do is if you add someone they'll send you an invoice for the remainder of that 12-month contract to pay that person if you if you drop someone I don't know that they credit I think that you normally would credit it toward the next year's payment or the next time you would add a user but I you guys do add and drop users decently often so if you're going to be doing that a lot makes it tricky to do annual payment because there's ups and downs So if you're adding a lot, I wouldn't recommend annual on that. Yeah, I can't guarantee that we won't do that. That's exactly what I was thinking because I actually just deleted, I think, yesterday or the day before. I deleted like three people. Yeah, and it gets to be really dicey if you're adding and dropping because you've got to do refunds and credits and everything like that. And nobody likes that. So I would recommend probably against that. Okay. Yeah, that would make sense. Okay. Yeah, just once you figure out what you're thinking, time framing, which option you want to do, I just need to know the company name, address, who's going to be the signer. Is it still Jordan? And then I would email the new paperwork over to get it signed. As soon as it's signed, we'll get it adjusted. And then the next invoice would be at the new amount. Okay. What is the time frame to have that done? I mean, we're done with them as of 7-31, so I just need to know a time frame on how the turnaround time is. Before 7-31, a couple of days, a couple of days, at latest before 7-31. Now, it might, actually, I'm going to be alpha last week, so it might be good to get it figured out, signed, and handled before the 25th, just to make sure I'm around and it gets handled and adjusted because I do the contract and everything like that. So I would say probably by end of the week of the 21st, get new paperwork signed so we can ensure that it's changed next time. Whatever you pay this month, that'll still be at the old rate. And then just the next charge for whenever that happens in August would be the new. Okay. So $15 per. Yeah. So basically we just need to confirm with Jordan if he wants to do one year or two year, and then we'll be able to let you know. You said one year was $70? $75. $75. Okay. I think that's... Yeah, I don't have any other questions. You don't have any other questions either. We just needed the price on what we're looking at. Yeah. As far as I know, it has no interest in going anywhere right now. So I would not assume anything other than the two-year. and maybe so yeah that's what i was thinking too yeah so i can shoot you i'll talk to jordan maybe even right after we get off here and then i can shoot you a message with perfect you know what we decide and who the contract should go to and all of that um even if the contract does go to jordan and he signs it can the invoices be sent to dj certainly instead of to jordan okay okay because he's dj's director of finance so it just makes more sense that they just lay it in his inbox. Right currently. Oh, are they? Okay, they are coming. Sure, delete them. Okay. Yeah, they could go to whoever. It doesn't need to be the signer. Okay, perfect. All right, sounds good. All right, well, I will wait to hear back. And any other questions or anything, just let me know. And I'll circle back if I haven't heard by the end of the week. All right, sounds good. That works. And then we can still have the credit card on file to pay that? Yeah, the credit card on file can remain. As long as that's on file, that'll remain. We'll just change the amounts and change the terms and everything like that, but that can remain. All right, perfect. So, for seamless transition, we just need a couple days, and then good to go. Yep. Perfect. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. Very well. Have a great day. We'll talk to you soon. You too. Bye. Bye. Bye now.",
