The old ones got shut down. I forgot to update you guys. So just delete the two that you have on file. Okay. No, here's a new one. I don't have the ability to apparently delete a card, so I'm going to have to ask somebody else to do that, but I think I can add one in for you. So it's not 2581 or 3589? Okay, so it's a brand new one. Okay. Yeah, one had fraud on it, and the other one, for some reason, the parent company of my company changed corporate structure. So the actual name on the card changed to RTC Financial Group. It used to be Risk Theory. But anyway, let me know when you're ready. Okay, so 2581 and 3589 will be removed. Okay, remove both.
