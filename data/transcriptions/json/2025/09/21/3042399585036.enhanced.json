You are the first participant. Please stand by. What a good idea. Hello. Hello, Caitlin. How are you? Good. How about you? I'm all right. Do you hear me all right? Yeah, I'm good. Excellent, excellent. And I don't recall, is there anyone else joining us, or is it just you and I on the call today? Michelle's joining us. Looks like she's just coming in now. Awesome, awesome. Hello. Hello, Michelle. How are you doing? I'm all right. I'm all right. I also wanted to kind of show you around PC Recruiter. If background noise gets to be too loud, let me know. I work from home and there's about 30 kids on a water bounce house in my front yard. So there's a little bit of screaming going on out there. So let me know if it gets too distracting. Party at your house. Yeah, we do just kind of before school starts a couple weeks, we do a random weekday summer party. It started during COVID and it caught on. So people just come and go all day. And we have one of those big like water bounce house slides and food and all kinds of stuff going on. So there's a whole mess of people out there. But I'm in here doing a little bit of work. I've been off and on all day, so happy to show you around the system here a little bit. So I wanted to start out and just find out a little bit more about what you're looking for in a software package. What are your main criteria, requirements, or what do you use right now? Michelle, I can go if you want. Me too. Yeah, sure. Yes. Right now we are using StaffTrack, which I believe you guys have an integration with of some kind, we've heard. We use them as kind of our full-fledged system right from posting our job postings to reviewing candidates to attaching them to job orders to seeing their hours and processing the payroll. we're really just looking for a system that's a little bit more modern you know a staff track unfortunately doesn't have very much technology in terms of automation or AI or anything like that so we were kind of just hoping to see PC Recruiter I believe if I'm not mistaken you may also have like a time and attendance, possibly a scheduling piece to your system? If I believe I saw the right thing, if so, that's something that we're also interested in. Okay. We have a little of that. So around PC Recruiter, we do have a timesheets module. So you can have people, if you have contractors, they can clock in. There is a, excuse me, there's an app that they can download, and then they can clock in and out and those are hours are fed into PC Recruiter and then they're pushed out to QuickBooks from there. So that's kind of what that will do. Not really individual schedules per se, but we can track hours and stuff like that. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we are going to be a full ATS and CRM. We're going to have the ability to track companies, candidates, interviews, positions. you can post jobs share jobs search the database group candidates push them on roll-up lists and then using those roll-up lists you have the capacity to send out email campaigns sequences we have a drip campaign sequencing piece as well we do also have an AI suite so you can go ahead and set it up to kind of work with there's some content generators there's an AI search there's even a nice auto-match feature where it'll pull the closest, I think, 15 to 20 matches to a job in your system. So that'll work real well, which is kind of cool. So a lot of nice things in there. Were you looking to replace your staff track or supplement it? I've not heard of any integration that we wrote with them. That's not to say it doesn't exist, because a lot of times the way our API works, the softwares can actually write integrations without us even knowing, and that does happen. so that could have been okay uh yeah it's very possible they had given your company as one that they had maybe integrated with in the past i'm not sure to what extent and i'm sure it would be sort of custom for us as well um but yeah i guess it really depends on what your system offers but yeah we are looking at a potential either replacement of staff track or if there is an integration possibility with some pieces of yours some pieces with theirs or theirs for payroll like we're very open to what's possible at this point. Okay, sure, sure. And with our open API, it makes it easy to write a custom integration. And sometimes, like, they might write an integration or something like that. So maybe they've done it before. So that could be the case that is happening. So, yeah, so let me kind of show you around what we've got. We have a couple of different interfaces, actually. So we have PC Recruiter Classic, which is kind of our base package. It's been around quite a while. It's going to allow for tracking. it's going to allow for pretty much the full gamut of ATS. We do also have a CRM product called PCRM, which is a newer interface. And when we designed the CRM, we actually included all of the features from PC Recruiter into the CRM. So it actually was a CRM, but with all the ATS features in it. So I'll show you both interfaces. You can kind of pick and choose. You get both, is what we've been doing now. So two ways there. So I will first hop into one of them. Let me share my screen here. I'm going to share my screen. Should be looking now at my sign-in screen right here. Okay. I see it. And then, perfect. So as I'm in here, I'm going to go ahead and get logged in. So this is all cloud-based. It's going to run on PC or Mac. So a lot of different ways that you can access the system here. So as I go through, I'm going to log myself in. And the system itself is going to look mostly like this. Very, very configurable. So you have a lot of say in how this is going to look, what fields are where, and what have you. So as you're going through, essentially, you're going to have a main menu bar at the top of the screen. That's going to be primary navigation. And that's going to be where you go to get your primary elements of PC Recruiter. And those really are going to be your names, your companies, your positions. people, companies, jobs. So everything is kind of centered around those three record types. The names are going to be your contacts, also your candidates, so pretty much any person that you want to track in the system. Your company is going to be your actual company records that you're working with, so all your clients, and also that's going to be potential clients too. So you can put potential companies you're working with in here, there's even a sales pipeline if If you were looking for that, so you can use the sales pipeline in our CRM piece. So you can actually have a custom pipeline where you can drag and drop them through various different steps in a sales process, which is nice. And then your positions, of course, the jobs you're looking to fill. Those positions are entered into PC Recruiter. They are stored. We have a job description generator. We are also going to have the ability to share those and post those on your website. so when the jobs are entered you can post those on your website you can let candidates apply online through a custom application screen you're going to be able to also collect online applications and then you can move them through a custom pipeline so you have a custom interview pipeline in the piece in the in the system as well which is a cool face so those are three primary record types I'm going to look into each of those three as I show you the demo here And then also up here you have a daily schedule. That's going to be for scheduling meetings, phone calls, follow-ups, anything of that nature. And that's going to give you capacity to sync that with Outlook or Google Calendar if you wish. Rollups is going to be a list creation tool, so what you can do within those. If I wanted to go to Rollups, that's going to let me go to my list of all of my different groups of people. So I have maybe tech and sales people. I have 365 messaging architects. I can go down here and see I have everyone 80 kilometers or less from Toronto. So I can kind of group these Rollup lists, put candidates into the list at once or one at a time or en masse. and I can even go into, maybe I want to look at my account manager candidates list. I can go into that list and then I can actually work within that list because when I open it, it's going to open up and show me whatever field I wish of the person's information. So I can put email address, last activity, work phone, even maybe I have a couple custom fields. So I can put some different things in there and I can look at each specific record, keeping a list at the top. So as I go to the next record, that's going to show me Dan's information. If I go to Elena's record, it will go to her information. And then I have a custom landing area here for all of the detail of that person. And then scroll down a little bit, I'm going to see there's my activity history. This is going to be every interview, every email, every follow-up, every contact I've had with this person. It's essentially like a journal, like a personal journal for this specific candidate there. So it's going to be very simple to set this up any number of different ways. There's a whole bunch of reporting options as well, different analytics and things like that. Does everything make sense so far? Everything look good? Any questions out of the gate? No question. there and I'm going to be able to see here is the company record whatever fields I want so that's all up to me so you can have this in three columns four columns five columns ten columns put in your own fields use our defined fields whatever and then you're going to have two subsets of data associated with each company you're going to be able to look at all of the positions so you're going to see all the positions right here these are all my jobs that I have open at this specific company and if the position has a little chain link next to that denotes to me that there's a pipeline of candidates for that specific position that I could look into and kind of see who's interviewing and where they stand I'm also going to have another subset of data these are all my contacts in here at this specific company so I'm going to be able to see here's all my contacts I can go through any of them I can see who's placed who's an employee I can see who's my hiring manager Ben Brown right there and then what's cool is I can click into Ben's record and actually look specifically at the details of his record. Now I have one name record for this specific person, a place where I can put their phone numbers, their email addresses, and then I have a specific history of everything that's gone on with them as well. So I'm going to be able to very easily see what's gone on here with each person. I could also give them a quick email just by clicking next to their email address, send them a form letter, compose a letter on my own, anything like that. So those are my people there. So I like to go into positions after this. So I'm going to be able to see here's all of my different job openings. If I go into position right there, that's going to show me, if I go into position, that's going to show me here's all the positions. Here's the last 50 that I was looking at, the last 50 positions that I had been working with. So if I go into, let's say, this lead engineer, that's going to show me the detail of that job. And I'm going to be able to see whatever I want here, various different fields. I can see a nice job description here. There's an AI generator that'll generate a description if you don't have one. And then you're also going to have the ability to, like I said, share this with your website. So what you can do is if there's one or more openings and it's available slash open, so one opening or more available open, it'll show online in green. So it's going to show online and it's going to be able to interface with your website. So you can go ahead and take a job board and you're going to be able to see here's the various different templates that you can choose. choose. So if you wanted them to show in a list format or maybe you wanted a little more chunky list or maybe you wanted a table or anything like that. So you're going to be able to see those details right there and this is just data pulled directly out of your database and then when the candidates want to look at one of these jobs you can click right there. They're going to be able to show you the detail so they're going to see the detail as pulled directly out of your database and then they can apply online from there. So they can go and apply online fill out whatever information you wish you're going to be able to then have them loaded directly into the database and maybe they upload a resume maybe they answer a questionnaire maybe they have 15 questions or fields you want them to fill in to all up to you so it's",
