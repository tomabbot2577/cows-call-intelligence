Hi, how are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good, thank you. Yeah, so I called earlier because one of our recruiters, I think, is having a little bit of an issue with, I think it's Outlook. It's either Outlook or PCR. So basically he sent an email to one of the clients via PCR. Like he pressed the email logo on their profile and then to send like a marketing email. And then after he sent that, he went on his Outlook account and it's showing on his sent folder that it's sent twice. Oh. Yeah, but on PCR activities, it's only showing that he sent it once. so I'm not sure like which side it's causing it or why it's causing it okay that is probably a setting does he have PCR mail configured um let me double check sorry let me just quickly go to his desk I could probably tell so what I think what's going on is that in PCR mail when you do the incoming mail server there's an option to make just put an extra a copy in the folder and And I think that's probably set to yes. So what's happening is it's sending once and we're putting an extra copy in the send folder, but it didn't actually send twice. But I can confirm once I look. What is the database name that person logs in as? The Newport Group. The Newport Group. Okay. Yep. And what is that person's username? Eric, E-R-I-C-S. E-R-I-C-S? Okay. Yeah, Eric S. Yep. let me see yeah it's probably just the one setting and unfortunately it's just put a copy there but it that's yeah that's what i uh gathered from google from what google was telling me but yeah i wasn't sure yeah it's probably just that one setting like with some mail servers we don't really have to not the majority of our clients are usually either gmail or uh yep outlook and they do it automatically yep that's exactly what it is okay so i'm going to split this setting so it's in that when you go into PCR mail the mail server screen when you go to configure it says save send email the sent items folder it was set to yes I'm going to set it to no yeah so going forward that should stop it okay perfect it only sent once though okay perfect yeah that's what I figured I figured it was just sent like a copy um but yeah that's that's good to know thank you so much at least uh in the future if anyone else has that issue then I'll I can just do that from my end. Thank you. Oh, no problem. You should be all set now. Awesome. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye.",

to connect you.\n\n4\n00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:07,753\nJessal speaking.\n\n5\n00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,078\nHow can I help you today?\n\n6\n00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:09,973\nHi, Jessal.\n\n7\n00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,999\nThis is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence.\n\n8\n00:00:12,926 --> 00:00:13,500\nHi, how are you?\n\n9\n00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:14,248\nI'm good.\n\n10\n00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,071\nHow are you doing?\n\n11\n00:00:16,003 --> 00:00:16,635\nGood, thank you.\n\n12\n00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:17,500\nYeah,\n\n13\n00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,825\nso I called earlier because one of our recruiters,\n\n14\n00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:20,126\nI think,\n\n15\n00:00:20,206 --> 00:00:21,889\nis having a little bit of an issue with,\n\n16\n00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:22,611\nI think it's Outlook.\n\n17\n00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:28,559\nIt's either Outlook or PCR.\n\n18\n00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,549\nSo basically he sent an email to one of the clients via PCR.\n\n19\n00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:39,432\nLike he pressed the email logo on their profile and then to send like a marketing\n\n20\n00:00:39,512 --> 00:00:39,673\nemail.\n\n21\n00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,945\nAnd then after he sent that,\n\n22\n00:00:43,985 --> 00:00:47,153\nhe went on his Outlook account and it's showing on his sent folder that it's sent\n\n23\n00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:47,374\ntwice.\n\n24\n00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:50,855\nOh.\n\n25\n00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,759\nYeah, but on PCR activities, it's only showing that he sent it once.\n\n26\n00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,443\nso I'm not sure like which side it's causing it or why it's causing it okay that is\n\n27\n00:01:00,463 --> 00:01:04,706\nprobably a setting does he have PCR mail configured um let me double check sorry\n\n28\n00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:08,868\nlet me just quickly go to his desk I could probably tell so what I think what's\n\n29\n00:01:08,888 --> 00:01:12,951\ngoing on is that in PCR mail when you do the incoming mail server there's an option\n\n30\n00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,033\nto make just put an extra a copy in the folder and And I think that's probably set\n\n31\n00:01:16,053 --> 00:01:16,714\nto yes.\n\n32\n00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:30,389\nSo what's happening is it's sending once and we're putting an extra copy in the\n\n33\n00:01:30,425 --> 00:01:30,861\nsend folder,\n\n34\n00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,820\nbut it didn't actually send twice.\n\n35\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,220\nBut I can confirm once I look.\n\n36\n00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,300\nWhat is the database name that person logs in as?\n\n37\n00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,300\nThe Newport Group.\n\n38\n00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,780\nThe Newport Group.\n\n39\n00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,220\nOkay.\n\n40\n00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,580\nYep.\n\n41\n00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,600\nAnd what is that person's username?\n\n42\n00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,460\nEric, E-R-I-C-S.\n\n43\n00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,880\nE-R-I-C-S?\n\n44\n00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,380\nOkay.\n\n45\n00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,200\nYeah, Eric S.\n\n46\n00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:53,540\nYep.\n\n47\n00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:03,053\nlet me see yeah it's probably just the one setting and unfortunately it's just put\n\n48\n00:02:03,053 --> 00:02:06,878\na copy there but it that's yeah that's what i uh gathered from google from what\n\n49\n00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:10,465\ngoogle was telling me but yeah i wasn't sure yeah it's probably just that one\n\n50\n00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:14,290\nsetting like with some mail servers we don't really have to not the majority of our\n\n51\n00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,876\nclients are usually either gmail or uh yep outlook and they do it automatically yep\n\n52\n00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:21,940\nthat's exactly what it is okay so i'm going to split this setting so it's in that\n\n53\n00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,005\nwhen you go into PCR mail the mail server screen when you go to configure it says\n\n54\n00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:30,547\nsave send email the sent items folder it was set to yes I'm going to set it to no\n\n55\n00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:34,134\nyeah so going forward that should stop it okay perfect it only sent once though\n\n56\n00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:38,198\nokay perfect yeah that's what I figured I figured it was just sent like a copy um\n\n57\n00:02:38,198 --> 00:02:42,502\nbut yeah that's that's good to know thank you so much at least uh in the future if\n\n58\n00:02:42,502 --> 00:02:46,088\nanyone else has that issue then I'll I can just do that from my end.\n\n59\n00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:52,493\nThank you.\n\n60\n00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,137\nOh, no problem.\n\n61\n00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:00,582\nYou should be all set now.\n\n62\n00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:00,582\nAwesome.\n\n63\n00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,582\nThank you so much.\n\n64\n00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:00,582\nHave a great day.\n\n65\n00:03:00,104 --> 00:03:00,582\nThank you.\n\n66\n00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:00,582\nBye-bye.\n\n67\n00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:00,582\nBye.\n\n",
