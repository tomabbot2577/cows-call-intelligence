This is Tyler over at PC Recruiter. Just wanted to call and let you know we were able to diagnose and fix the issue that was causing the slowness. Just wanted to confirm that you were seeing the same thing. I'm going to send you an email here as well so just let me know that email if it's running faster for you or if you're still experiencing any issues. Thanks.",
