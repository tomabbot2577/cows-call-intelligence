    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. Can I just check with you to see where our account is at? I think we might have a bill. Okay. Let's see. And what is your name? Tara. I'm calling from Construction Recruiters. Okay. Let's see. It looks like there might be a bill from May the 1st. Construction. I guess I thought there was a card on file. It's not going through then. I know we did change billing systems. So some of those that were kind of like not really like an auto pay, kind of like an auto pay. They had to be redone in the new billing system. Let me see what we've got here. So it's Tara Allen at Construction Recruiters, right? Yes, yep. Okay, I have to reopen this back up. So maybe May, June, and July haven't been paid. I'll tell you one second here. Action, recruit. Okay. Correct. You used to be in what was called a sales receipt where we stored a card, but it just kind of really sent you a receipt before the card was even attempted. With the new billing system, it now offers a real auto pay, and so you do have to put in your card details. Do you have the invoices that it's been sending you? I think so. I mean, I know. Colin is away, so I'm just checking his emails, and I'm noticing them. So I didn't know that these went. Yeah. So I just go to you. They should be going to you. Yeah, they should be going to you, Tara, at construction-recruiters.com. And they'll come from billing at mainsequence.net. Here's what I can do. Yeah, but I just thought that he had it on file. Oh, it's my mistake. Yeah. So what you have to do from those invoices, if you go to View and Pay, you'll put in your card details. And then you can enroll in AutoPay going forward, but you'll want to take care of those invoices. And then the other advantage. So it's May, June, and July. Yeah. Those are the three that are open right now. Okay. And then the other thing that you can do with this new billing system, it's called a customer portal. and I can send you that link. And what you could do is sign up for an account. It would use your email address, but what it would do is with this new billing system, like let's say your card ever changes or things like that, you could actually go into the site. You'd have to first create the account. It doesn't use anything for your PCR login or anything like that. It's just a payment process and things. Yeah, so you can go to like invoices to view and pay. you could also manage your card that you're using in the vault area, which would be at the right once you're in the site. Okay. All right. So the first thing is I should pay these bills and then I can go back. Yeah, I can go back in and set that up and then just have it on file moving forward. Right. Yeah, you just got to redo your card stuff this time. Okay. All right. I'll do that. I'll make these payments now. Okay. All right. If you have any questions, let me know. Okay. You're welcome. All right, great. Have a good day. Bye. You too, bye.",
