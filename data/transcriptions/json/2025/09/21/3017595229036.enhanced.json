    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. Please enter the meeting password followed by pound. Who are in the meeting now? There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hello. It's Robin. Hi, Robin. How are you? I am fine. How are you doing? I'm okay. Oh, you're the two participants in the meeting. Yeah. Mark Anderson. Send us something that has nothing to do with our company in any way. Yeah, I replied back on it too. Before you did. Looks like a printing order. No wonder I was so confused. I'm like, I have no idea what's going on here. Yeah, but I'm like, I didn't send him anything. He's got nothing. I'm like, and even if it were quoted, it would have just been an email. I don't have any idea what it could possibly be. Yeah, and he doesn't do anything until the end of the year. So I was kind of like, what the heck are we talking about here? Thank you. Hello, Brent. How are you? Hey, good. Can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you just fine. Oh, perfect. Yeah, I wasn't sure. I forgot to plug in my camera. And it's got my voice and everything on it, so I wanted to make sure you could hear me. All good. All good. Glad you could join us today. And I don't know if you got the email or noticed that the data was just moved today. So the data is moved. It's ready to go under your link. Perfect. So we have that. So yeah, Robin, I don't know if you saw any of that. I don't know if I saw it yet, but I'm kind of buried in email stuff. I'm still digging through them. What's that noise? What's that noise? I don't hear a noise. Oh. It wasn't me. It did for a moment. Sound like a robot. Like, beep, beep, beep. All right. So I wanted to run through. So Robin is going to be your trainer at PC Recruiters. So she's going to be the one getting you trained up and running on the system there. and what we have today is just a few questions to kind of give her an idea about how you're going to use the system what pieces and what functions you want to set up and then all of that now Robin do you have the questionnaire do you want me to run through my version of it I I you can run through your own I really just take notes in a ticket so that way I don't have to go in five places to find out information. Perfect, yeah. So we'll have a couple of questions for you as we go, but just to talk a little bit about what you're going to be using and how you're going to be using the system and whatnot. And then once that's done, we'll get the first several calls on the schedule to get you up and running and get something scheduled out. Jim, before you get started, refresh my memory. Whose database or what database did he get? I'm going to make a note of that here. It was from Sean Reeves. Sean Reeves. Sean Reeves, okay. He worked, I think, for Custom Concrete and did recruiting for them and then gave him the data when he was done, I think is my understanding. Okay. That's correct. Okay. Okay. Okay. And so you're working in the concrete industry. You're hiring internally, right? Yes, we are. Okay. And you have direct hire, so it's internal. Are you on a Windows machine or a Mac? Windows. Perfect. And what's your preferred browser? It's the Internet Explorer one, whichever one that's... Oh, Edge? Edge? Yes. Okay. That'll work well. And then your email, who hosts your email? Is it Outlook or something else? BrentS at customconcrete.com. Okay, but do you use Outlook or Gmail or something else? Oh, I'm sorry. Outlook. I'm sorry. I got to turn the volume up a little bit. No, no worries. No worries. And do you have any additional data that you need to get into the system other than the data that's already been moved over? Do you have any resumes, spreadsheets, anything else you need to import? No, I do not. Okay. Okay. And are there any of our partnerships that you want to set up an integration to? Do you want to use RingCentral or ZoomInfo or Indeed or any of those? Indeed and LinkedIn would be, do you have one for ZipRecruiter as well? Yeah. Perfect. So Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter. Okay. Okay, and now that is all the standard questions that I have on this list. chair Robin is there anything else that you need to know yeah okay so hiring internally I'm sure yes okay So there's a premium package, okay, and it's just one user, right? Okay. Okay. Because you're doing hiring internally for yourselves, is the job order – I'm sorry, is the job board kind of like a priority to get going? So, like, can it, like, view your jobs and apply? Yeah, it would be nice. Okay. So, we don't want to put it off, like, too late then. Okay, let me look at our website. How's the concrete? We have one currently that we use. Shawn used something completely different. So, he has data that we were trying to use. And right now, we use ADP for our applicant tracking system. And we also use it for payroll. That's why we used it. But he was telling us that, you know, this tool was so much better. So we're looking at that and possibly running the two concurrently together or going away from ADB completely and going to PCR recruiters. So we're still trying to figure it out for a year and see how it goes. Okay. All right. Let's see. Okay. All right. So I guess that's pretty much it. So with your training, you're going to get 10 hours, and I will be very upfront with you that the first couple sessions are going to be a lot more set up. Like we're going to get you set up with your username, get your email integrations going. So you won't really be using it too much after that first session, but at least that gets you set up for things that we'll do down the road. And then for the training, what I like to do is keep it no more than an hour, so I keep your attention. Because if we go more than an hour, you're going to forget half of what I show you. So just be prepared. You know, it's going to be, you're going to have 10 sessions spread out. And we'll kind of, after each session, see where we're at. I like to focus, like, for the first one, definitely it's going to be mostly setup. But the next session, we'll probably focus on companies, names. And then another session, maybe like putting the jobs in. We want to do job order, maybe like a little bit with pipeline setup, so that way when you're putting the jobs in, It has kind of like a workflow that works for you. And then after that, that's when we could do the job board. So there's definitely going to be some work that we'll have to do first. But just be patient with me. I will get you there. But if I show you like super, super high level, you won't be good in any area. So each kind of area builds on the next because it's a very relational database. When are you looking to do your first training? Let me look. Like are you looking for something this week or? I have some time Thursday and Friday. So I guess that's tomorrow and Friday. Okay. What openings do you have if those dates have worked? Well, let's see. I have, I'm not available at 9.30 tomorrow, but I could do, let's say like 11 or I could do three Eastern tomorrow. 11 would be amazing. Okay. Let me send you a meeting invite for that. And then I use just Google Meet for the meetings. Let me get your email address out of here. Okay. Let's see. I'm so sorry. Okay. So that's it. Thursday. Trying to make sure I don't like overbook us where we're all on the phones and nobody's available to answer phones either. Okay, so. So, how's that window? There it is. Okay. I am going to send the first one right now for tomorrow at 11 a.m. Eastern. I should double check that though. Let's see. You are also Eastern time, I assume. Are you, but being in Indiana, I know they kind of are a little different. Is it one o'clock or one 12 right now for you right now? Yeah, they used to, it would, the time wouldn't change here, but we, we stay with Eastern standard time now, Indiana time. Okay. Oh, they do. Okay. Yep. I remember they used to like parts around Indianapolis. Okay. So that's probably why I don't have a time zone option for that. I think Arizona is the only one that kind of does that a little bit now. Okay. All right. So that one's it. Now, do you want to go ahead and book for Friday now as well? We could maybe do the same time just to keep it consistent. You can read my mind, Robin. I was going to ask you if you had 11 the next day as well. Yeah, let's do that. So we're going to put you for 11 the next day too. Okay. so that was Thursday and then we'll do another one for Friday and I'll put the number two after the second invite so because each one's going to have a different uh different link in it okay all right so those are now sent over to you and we are scheduled perfect okay well as we go through if you need me to go slower faster talk about something you don't care about you have issues, concerns just let me know I want to make sure it's a good experience for you so just let me know whatever you need okay Absolutely. I definitely will. And then if you need to add any users down the line, let me know on that. I can help with that. Or if there's anything you don't know who to talk to, I can get you the right person. Perfect. Yep, and I've got the second invite. So it's up on my calendar. We're good to go. All right. We are all set then. All right. Perfect. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. I love this. You guys are on it. And that's what I enjoy. We'll get you going. All righty. Well, have a great day, and I'll talk to you tomorrow. Thanks. Have a good one. You too. Bye. Bye, John. Thanks, Ron.",
