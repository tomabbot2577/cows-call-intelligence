    "text": " Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. It's Sandy Welch with Beardmore Auto Family. How are you? I'm well, Sandy. How are you? I'm doing well. So I got in under Ted's admin username. Uh-huh. And then, so now I guess I need to figure out how to go to my username and give me full admin permission. Yeah, you can do that. If you're in there, go to the System button in the main menu bar. Okay. And then the first option, Users. Yep. And then Manage Users. Okay. And then you should see you in the list down there. Yep. And if you go into your username by clicking on it, there's going to be some tiles on the left-hand side. Security should be the second one down. It's a little lock icon. A little lock. Yep, there it is. And then there's one all alone at the top that's a system administrator. You'll want to hit that drop down and make sure that says full permission and hit the little disk icon at the top of that. It's kind of in the middle of the screen, but it's the top of the lower portion. That will save the change. Full permission and then the disk kind of in the middle of the page there. So that'll do it and now you are a full admin user. So you can go in and have a full admin user and everything like that. Are you all just one user now? Yeah. Is that being adjusted? Well, I need to have – I'm trying to get our GSM viewing capabilities. So that's what I need to do. I need to get him as a user probably. Okay. Is there a difference between a user and a viewer? Not really, but I will tell you. Is that like a manager who's just going in to look at kind of what's going on? Yes. Okay. Okay, what they can do is you can let them use the admin username, A-D-N-I-N. That is in there. That's kind of one that's in there like a freebie because it's for if someone loses their username or if you have someone that needs to go in and occasionally just look at like a little report or do a quick see what's going on, but they're not actively recruiting. They're not moving people through the pipeline. They're not sending emails and doing things like that. Yes, yes. And then what is the password for that? That I don't know. Do we create one? Or do I use the, oh, I used the one that Ted had. Oh, well, there should be one in your user list. Is there an admin? The very first one? Okay, just a second. Admin, system administrator. Yeah, if you click into that, that is your admin username. You can put the new password in here, whatever you want it to be. Do I go to security again? Yep. No, no, no. should be right on the information screen when you click on the username. Oh. There's some gray bars and one is going to be security information. Oh, okay. And you'll see the password, verify password there? Yeah. Okay, if you put a new password in there, put it in both places. Okay, so I have to do that. Okay, um, okay. And then now that you have admin permission, if you need to change this password you can do that but this would be a good way that he can log in just to view some data it's not going to be a build user and then just whatever username or whatever password you give here that's going to be the password that okay let me make sure I get this done right And then after I verify the password, typed in the password, typed in verified password, and then do I have to save it again? Yep, hit save. To that disk? Yep, that little disk. And if it for some reason didn't match, it'll tell you now. Okay. But if it matches, it's good. Okay, yeah, I just did it and it's good. Perfect. So you're all up to date there. Perfect. Okay. to check with you is I need to get a new signer because Ted was the listed signer. So he would be, if ever you needed a backup of the data or if you ever needed a password change or anything like that, our team would say, oh, I need Ted's signature to get that done. So it's not going to be him anymore. So who would be a good signer? That'll be me. Okay. Okay. So may I send over new paperwork? It'll be the same pricing, the same term, the same everything. just with a new name on it. Perfect. Let me make sure that I have your correct company name and address here. I've got your name in here because you're in my system. I have Beardmore Automotive, and I have, I don't, what is your street address? For some reason, there's not one in here. Okay, it's 418 Fort Crook Road, Bellevue, Nebraska. Oh my gosh, what's your zip code here? Let me think. 005, 68005. 68005. I'm seeing I've got that. Okay, perfect, Bellevue, Nebraska. So what I'll do, I will email over paperwork for one user at the same price, same everything, just to get you signed. And I'll send that later today or early tomorrow, and then just sign that. You need to do other than sign it, and then we can get you as the listed signer. you're already admin so you're all set okay perfect thank you so much I appreciate your time my pleasure thank you okay thanks Jim bye bye",
