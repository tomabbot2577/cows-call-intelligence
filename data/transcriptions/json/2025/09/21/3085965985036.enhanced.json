    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Jim Luzar at Sales Consultants here in Brookfield, part of MRI Network. Having a little trouble with capture, PCR capture. Can't pull it up. Oh, okay. Let's check to see. first let's check to see if you're logged in so if you go to the top right of your browser are you seeing the little capture icon up there by the puzzle piece if you click on that does it list a menu that has a bunch of websites like linkedin and indeed or is it asking for a url well there's that's the issue what i get is a little narrow bar coming out with something hidden in there so there's nothing to go to. I see. I actually did have a customer two days ago that had the same issue. So basically, I think we fixed it just by... I think we can fix it though just by uninstalling the capture tool and reinstalling it so I'll walk you through that start by going to the three dots at the top right of your browser and then look for extensions and then visit Chrome Web Store under extensions perfect use the search bar up at the top of this this new page that will open up and type in PCR capture and hit enter and that'll give you one search result just click on that and install yeah okay got it yeah click on that and then at the top right there'll be a button to remove from Chrome yes do that click on that and then remove and then once that cycles through it should only take a second or two it should show you the button to add to Chrome again yes in that same spot okay perfect click on that and then add extension and once that completes at the top right of your browser there is that like white puzzle piece I think it's a puzzle piece icon if you click on that it'll list all of your extensions. We just want to make sure we pin the PCR capture tool. Okay. What kind of an icon did you say? Extensions? Yeah, exactly. Extensions one, where you can then hit the pin next to PCR capture. It looks like a puzzle piece, I think is the... Okay. Got it. Well, if I hit it, it puts an X through it. That's good. If it's blue with a line through it, that means it is pinned. Okay, got it. So that's good. Okay, and then, so yeah, you should now see the PCR capture logo again back to the left of the puzzle piece. We'll just get you signed in. So if you click on that, it might ask you for your PCR URL. So you can, gotcha. It might be just putting some placeholder text in there currently, and you'll have to go over to PCR in a new tab and copy your full web address and paste it in there. Copy this, what I'm seeing here? What you're seeing there, if it ends in something like my company, that means it's just placeholder text. So we need your actual web address for your PCR. So go ahead and open up PCR in a new tab in the browser, and then at the top grab the full web address and copy it. Okay, so I'm opening up PCR new browser here. Perfect. Okay. Yeah, and just grab that web address, copy it, and then you can go back to the little icon, the PCR icon at the top right, to paste in that web address. Okay, got that. And then hit login and it should ask you for username and password. Yep. Database. Okay. Now we're back in. All right. Good. So, yeah, if you want to test that while we're still on the phone, maybe jump over to LinkedIn. And if you have a LinkedIn page that's already been pulled up, just refresh it once to take on the new settings we just adjusted. Okay. Okay, I'm going to refresh that. And I'll pull up a guy that I just wanted to pull in here. And did that click to add button appear for you on the right? Oh, good. Okay. Yep. Excellent. Okay. Hitting it twice now. Yep. Okay. We're good. It's coming up. Excellent. Yeah. Let me know if that pops up again, if you have any other issues, but you should be good to go here and out. That's weird. I mean, that one I've never seen, just a really weird little bar coming down. Yeah, that was strange. I saw that the other day. At least I knew how to fix it based on some troubleshooting with that last customer. So we're all good now. Thank you so much, Garrett. Appreciate it. Thanks. Have a good one. You too. Bye now.",
