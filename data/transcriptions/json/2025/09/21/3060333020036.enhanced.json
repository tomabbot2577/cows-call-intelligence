    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm calling because I sent out a form letter to a group of names on a roll-up just now, and I still have the pop-up window up, you know, that, like, send letter pop-up, and it says composing email messages 23 of 23. It shows the, you know, roster of emails, The screen kept updating. It goes all the way to 23. It says bulk email complete. Duplicate email addresses will only receive one email. And it says 22 messages sent. And it says error could not send mail right up at the top in like a red banner. and I wanted to, I mean, I'm comforted by the fact that it says 22 messages because presumably, basically, if I go through the activities, I wanted to vet my approach here. If I go through the activities records of this roll-up, one of them will be blank, right? Even though... Most likely, yeah. The activities would be the place to look. If you do see an activity, that means that the email did go out. And so does it list anywhere in that list, like somebody's name that it didn't get sent to at all? No, it looks like Microsoft timed out, the server timed out. Oh, okay. Yeah, so normally I go through there and I'm like, oh, here's the problem. But it sounds like basically I wanted to verify because I obviously don't want to send somebody something twice, you know, the same email. If it's not, if it didn't go through, it won't be in activities. If it went through, it will be in activities. I mean, that's my kind of, all right, perfect. Thank you for this handholding. Yeah, no, no problem. No problem at all. Anything else kind of weird with that? We did, I think we had, oh, no, it was Gmail. We saw reports that Gmail in general is kind of acting weird today, even outside of PCR. But you said you were using Microsoft? Yeah, this would be this is through Liquid Web is our server. And then it's verified through, you know, through the Outlook. Yeah. OK, so it wouldn't be related. OK. Yeah. Thank you for trying to connect dots that I might know exist. I appreciate it. Yeah, no worries. Wonderful. Well, again, thank you for just that confirmation. You know, I'm a nervous Nellie, so just making sure I'm not going to be sending somebody the same thing. I appreciate it. I hope you have a really great day and that the Gmail thing resolves itself. Oh, thanks so much. Yeah, you as well. Reach out if you need anything else. I will. Thanks. All right. Bye. Bye.",
