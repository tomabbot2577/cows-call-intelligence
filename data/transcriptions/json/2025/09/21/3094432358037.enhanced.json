    "text": " Hey, Tyler. Hey, Robin. I got a quick question for you. Okay. Let me just see one. That won't do that. Okay. Let me just make sure. Okay. What's up? So let's say I put an offer letter as an attachment on somebody. Okay. For the record. And I want to email that attachment to a colleague. Okay. Would I have to like download it from PCR and send it? Like there's no real way to send like an attachment from a name record to someone else, right? Oh, no, you can. Wait, so are you in the pipeline or? No. Okay, so you're just on the, where are you at? So if the file is attached to the candidate, for example, you have to start from the candidate's record and go to attachments and then click email. So you have to start from the candidate with the file, not from the recipient. Otherwise, you would have to download it. You can't start from one name record and grab an attachment from a different record. Yeah. But when you do the email tab, it pulls up the name record. Yeah, you would just have to clear that out. It assumes you're going to email somebody about that, but if you clear it out, you could send that file to anybody. Just clear out the two lines. Okay. Now, if they're in the pipeline, then you could do it like all in one area. but not if you're starting from the name. Because if you had like your ad step screen pop up or if you right click and did email you could select who you're typing it to and then when you go to PCR files you could grab files from the company, the position, or the candidate from attachments. Does that make sense? Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, my headset just... Oh, okay. For some reason. Where did you cut off then? I don't know if you heard me then. I got like if you're doing it from the name record. Okay. So if you go to the name record and click attachments and then hit email, it'll default that candidate's email, but you could clear that out and send it to any email address. We just got to start from the candidate. The only way you can like email one person in a file about like something else is if you're in the pipeline, because that's the only place where it recognizes the relationship. I'm just alrighty well that's all I needed alrighty thank you thanks Robin alrighty bye",
