When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hello, Scott. Jim Lombardo calling with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just circling back with you. I caught your voicemail yesterday. I wanted to follow up, see how I could help. You were inquiring about the new features of PC Recruiter. I think you mean the AI suite of features, the content generators and search and whatnot. Give me a quick call when you get a moment. I'm happy to help you learn more about those or answer any questions you have. My direct is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. I will talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
