    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Mark Martin. Hey, yesterday I talked to somebody, I think Brian maybe. Anyway, I've been having trouble with my PC recruiter online with the global timeout. It seems like it's setting, it's timing me out like every five minutes. And so I called yesterday, and he walked me through clicking on setting or system and in the space typing. Now, since the time it took me to call you, since I dialed and got off the screen, it logged me out. Okay. So something's wrong here. Yeah, there are two or three things we can look at. It doesn't sound like it's going to be the inactivity timeout setting in the database because you probably have that set a lot higher than a few minutes. What it could be is if you're using a VPN. Are you using a VPN at all to access the Internet? No. Okay. So that would log you out, but it's not that. Next would be if you have too many tabs open on your browser. So do you have more than 10 or so tabs open at a time? Right now I have five. Okay. So it might not be that. Five should be fine. All right. And then the only other thing is I can whitelist your IP address and see if that helps. So let me just log into your database. Which company are you with? Markin Executive Recruiting. Got it. Okay, perfect. And then I'm just going to check to see the recent user logins so I can see your IP address, and then I'll put that on the whitelist for IP addresses. Okay. That should help. Let's see. Username mark. Yes. Perfect. What color could I be on if it's – I don't understand the color things for IP addresses? Yeah, sometimes I'm not sure why, but certain IP addresses have to be whitelisted on session-based websites like PCR session-based. But we – I just set up one for your IP address. It does look like the IP address changes every once in a while. That's probably where you're getting the logout. Okay. Let's see if this helps. So go ahead and log out of PCR and log in again, and then that should help where you're not getting logged out every five minutes. Okay. So I'm out. And I am back in. and you said it usually takes a few minutes then yeah so you know let's assume that you fix this and if i get timed out in the next the next time i am not clicking around in it for however long it is it's less than an hour i'll call back perfect yeah just give us a call back and we'll continue. Well, I could look at one more thing while I'm here. Okay. Yeah, that's already set. Well, okay. Yeah. We'll continue to troubleshoot if you still have any issues. Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much for your help. No problem. Have a good one. You too. Bye.",
