    "text": " Good morning, GPSG. Hi, is Sydney Britton available? This is she. Sydney, this is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I got an inquiry from you yesterday. I think you came over and wanted to give a call back and see how I could help. Hi. Yes, we were interested in, I guess, just learning more about your product and if it is on-prem or just cloud-based? Only cloud-based. Okay. So it's a cloud-based product. Is that what you're looking for? We're definitely interested in that too, but we also need – we're also looking for an on-prem one. So I'm more than happy to, if you guys have, like, some information you could send over, kind of more in-depth about your product. I couldn't really find much on your website in terms of how it works. Well, usually what we'll do is we set up a demo, kind of do a share screen, show you around. I actually have a couple different software options, and one of them does have an on-premise version. It's like a self-hosted. Okay. So we can look at both versions, compare them, see what features, functions you might want, and kind of take a look at both. Because like I said, one of our older product offers an on-premise, our newer one doesn't. Okay. That makes sense. Yeah, that would be great. Okay. And maybe a half hour or so just to kind of look around. We could go longer or a little shorter. I'm very open Thursday, if Thursday the 21st would work at all for you. Let me just pull up my co-worker's calendar because she's going to sit in with us as well. Sure. One second. If we could do Thursday, maybe early afternoon. Maybe like 1 p.m. Eastern. Would that work? That would be great. Perfect. What I'll do, I've got your email here. I'll send you over an email with an invite and a Zoom meeting so we can log into your share screen and take a look around. Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate the call. Fantastic. We'll talk with you then. Sounds good. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
