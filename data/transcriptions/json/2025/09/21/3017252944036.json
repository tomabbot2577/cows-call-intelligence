    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yes, hi. My name is Jamie with Management Recruiters of Davidson. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good, thanks. I'm trying to print a report, and I know there's got to be a really simple way to do it, and I just cannot figure it out. I'm wondering if someone could help me. What kind of report are you trying to run? Well, I'm trying to run a report of all of the companies that I entered yesterday. okay um you're probably better off doing well let's see let me think something because like i can figure out how to pull up how many like it was 25 but i don't know how to find out what all the names are okay you just want the companies okay yeah and is there something you're going to want to export or like print out or just see like in a list or yes i definitely want to print it out okay I gotta go back through all of them okay so depending on what you're looking for um there is a report that you can run under reports if you go to company reports okay and then click on summary report okay because the other thing that you could do is you could just search and put them into a roll-up list and then export from there, or this is more of a report. It kind of depends what you really want to do. Like, if you want to go back to them or have quick access to the records, it might be better to just do the search for them and then put them into a roll-up list. Oh, okay. Yeah, it just depends what you want to do. Like, if it's really just, I only need a report, then a report's fine. But if you actually want to have the records in a list, you might be better off making a roll-up of it. Okay, so I'm going to see if I can see what this gives me so far. Yeah, if you go to, like, company and go to advanced. Oh, okay, yeah. So this shows, oh, awesome, and it's in alphabetical order, too. Yeah. Oh, this is all the activities. It's not, how do I do it to just once I add it? So, okay, so let's, can we do a screen share? It would probably be easier that way. Okay. Sure. When, what do you, do you have RingCentral by any chance? No, I do not. Okay. What is your email address? It's jebjeb at mrdavidson.com. Okay. I'm going to send you a Google Meet. Okay. Let's see. Here it is. Okay. So I'm going to go to new meeting. Turn on instance. I add it to this meeting. Okay. Just sent you a meeting link. Okay. Let's see. Now, when you join, it's going to ask you about showing your camera or using your microphone. We don't need those features because we're watching your screen instead of your camera. and we're already on the phone so we don't need to all right so I just click join yes okie dokie oh here we go no camera found okay that's okay we don't need it anyway okay I'm gonna meet you in all right so you're in the meeting and then what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of the meeting screen there is the share screen option. It's in the middle like bottom but like in the middle of the toolbar. Yeah and then you're going to want to go over to entire screen. Okay and then if you have more than one monitor or actually you'll want to pick which screen to show and then click share. Okay. Let's go over to your database. Oh, I don't know if I did it right. You're fine. You're fine. Yep. Yeah, just go back over to your tab. Leave this meeting screen open. We just don't want to close it. Otherwise, you'll be kicked out of the meeting. So you'll just go over to your main PCR tab. Okay. Okay. So here's what I'm going to have you do. I'm going to have you click Company on the main toolbar. and then go to advanced and then let's go to you on let's expand the search parameters area and then date entered is we're going to want that field actually would you cut the company's all as you were I'm sorry would you have kept the companies all as like your own name yes and you just used like the ad company just general like you didn't do an import or anything right right okay all right just want to make sure i'm picking the right answer yeah okay just making sure i'm using the right criteria for you okay so um leave the first drop down set to predefined fields and then change that second drop down to date entered. Oops, you just went past it. Oh, there it is. Okay, and then put in the date that you're looking for and then hit add. Okay. And then going back to that top line again, let's switch company name to username. So if you created it, it should have your username so that should be fine okay now type in whatever your PC are you so it's just Jamie hit add now there's one like this and then sometimes it appears in all caps as well that's just um it doesn't really matter because this part's not case-sensitive when you log in typically it's going to show in all caps it's only the password that's really case sensitive so basically what we're doing is we're searching for any company entered with yesterday's date and the record has your username. Click in the username field. So up at the top where it says advanced search, click on that magnifying glass icon. That's going to give you your results. Okay, does this look about right? Okay, so from here what we're going to do is click on that select column heading way over at the left. there you go and select all results and then above this list there is the add to roll up option it looks like the little spiral notebook not on the main toolbar but on that perfect right there so we're going to put these companies into a roll up now if you want to make a new list we're going to go at the bottom right where it says add roll up because we're going to create a new one okay and you can call it like 715 companies or something like that okay okay hit save so what it's going to do it's going to make this roll-up list and we're just gonna let it process let it add those records okay let's click on that number 25 and that should open the list so here you have them all grouped together so if you just need to like work with them, they're in the list. And then as long as you have the security, over here at the left where it says select, select all results. And then up at the very top where you have your options for your rollup, let's go to that three-lined icon because I don't see it listed. Let's see if you have the feature. Select export, which is a – there you go. so that now you just hit CSV okay that's gonna be the cleanest format like if you need to move things like kind of do some things with them there they are and then this way too you see also like the same columns like if you are working from a roll-up and but then if you were actually need to go into a record you already have a group together instead of having to go back and do all these searches. Okay, cool. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate your help so much. Oh, you are welcome. Have a great week. All right. Thanks. You too. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
