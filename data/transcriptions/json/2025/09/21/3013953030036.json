I'm following up to an issue we were having regarding deleting activities last week and them not being deleted. I was just trying to find out what the status of that is because it's setting us behind. I need to be able to get this report printed out for everybody. Yeah, so that, I actually just confirmed that ticket this morning, and it is currently up with our QA team and development team to look into how we can correct that issue. Okay, so when do you anticipate that'll be looked at or corrected? I don't have a definitive timeline as of now. I do have a meeting with the QA team a little bit later today, and I can update you in that ticket as soon as I ask them. Okay. Hopefully it's something simple. It's just I need to pull reports for a bunch of people, and I've been waiting. I thought I was able to do it, but obviously, you know, there's an issue with those activities not being deleted. So, yeah, please. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me just confirm that it's it's the one that's in the custom report. Correct. Right. It's not it's deleting the activity from the record, but not updating like the actual last activity in on like the back end of the record. Right, right. And I deleted a few names from the recycle bin, and that didn't make a difference. So something's going on. Yep. Yeah, it's almost like it's not updating a column on the back end. It's like deleting it from the front end, but not as the last activity on the back end. Correct. yeah like I said I have a meeting with the QA guys at one today so I'll make sure I bring that up that way it gets put yeah please it's a priority anything you can do would be appreciated yep I will do that thank you have a great day",
