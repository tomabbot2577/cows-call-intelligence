    "text": " Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Robin, James from Cogent Resources. Hi, how are you? Good, you? Good. I've been traveling the last couple months and I tried to get your system to pay. Okay. And what the initial problem was I couldn't put Canada in there. Okay. Then you sent me a note that it was working. I went back in. It still wouldn't let me do it. But I did register as Ohio. Oh, yeah, that's not ideal. Can you check online? Because it looks like I can't get in either to the database now. To the database or the billing? Because that's something completely different. Yeah, the database. so I don't know if they put me in the lock or not or not no we didn't do that on yours yet let's see but anyway when I put Ohio they let me save it finally because I couldn't get anything to save before yeah you probably need I wonder if the invoice itself doesn't have the right criteria but then like in the billing portal then I'm now I don't think I was seeing it but then now I'm seeing hold on one second I got like a bunch of screens open I have to hold on one second okay did I write that hold on one second let me make sure I saved it otherwise I forget who I talked to and then I get in trouble for not writing activity okay okay look at that I'll be right back in a sec okay look at the thing I'll be right there anyway it's me Robin, you're still there? Yes. Okay. Okay. So what I just did is I had an email generated to you to – hold on a second. I'm going to do another one too as well. because I want to see. Yeah, but you did that to me last time and it still didn't work, eh? Yeah, I want to see it now. So let me do a... Do you have RingCentral or do you... No, actually, I'm at a cottage right now. I'm having a really hard time with internet. Okay. But I need to get this billing figured out because I get messages every week here. Okay. Can they not go ahead and... I'm going to do a Google Meet. Well, no, it's got the wrong – no, it's got to be changed on your site, I believe. Okay. Because it's part of the authentication on the card process. So let me do this. Let's see. Do a Google Meet meeting. I'm going to send you a meeting link because I want to see – I might have to fumble around with you there in the site. I don't think it's going to work because, like I said, I'm out of cottage and there's no limited internet access. Let's see if we can do it. But do you still have my old card and all the information on file? They could just charge me, couldn't they? Well, it's all through the new billing portal, so we need to just get this kind of fixed. Right, right. And how many months am I behind now? I only see one, I believe. Call the resource James Bonner. Invoices. There is only one. Okay. So the last time I called in, I talked to Wolf, and he used my old card, I guess. You talked to who? Was it Wolf, I think? no there's no email somebody now there's no one name will be see or let me see nobody started with a W anyway excuse me you anyway so as far as you know that the account has not been locked out then no okay that is definitely not locked up so it might be yours are you getting to the login screen and just not putting in your username password or are you not getting to the login page. I'm getting to the login screen and I'm getting my name and James and all that is there and I go to put the password in and it's telling me it's invalid. Yeah, so that'd be... Are you picking the correct database? Like which database do you log into? Yeah. Which database do you log into? I don't think I still have it up here. I'll just try. I'm not getting your email either. It's just my reception. So you're telling me even though I saved it with my company information or my credit card and my name because it's Ohio and I'm not in Ohio. It went through but that could possibly mess up. It may not. Did it go through? No, well the last one I see there's a payment. I don't know. There's currently an open one though so we need to get it worked out and if it's better that we just do when you're back in the office you know we can do that again an invoice you're saying for july is still outstanding right so was july paid or no no it's not paid july is not okay so july is not paid okay i'll have to do when i go back in the office then because um yeah because when you sent me the last email said here james go into this view and and I've definitely seen where I found it so we could try a different couple ways I'd rather it get done right the first time so that it gets accepted and there's no issues down the road so when you are back in the office you know just let me know and we can do a screen share then yeah okay because I couldn't find anything that dropped down for anything for Ontario at all or yeah it depends where you go you got to select the country first but yeah and i was trying to yeah and i was trying to like lately i'm like okay there's this way like it wouldn't if you went right to the invoice but then i was doing other things i'm like okay it's showing there now so i don't know if they've kind of changed things recently i just wanted to so i kind of want to see what it looks like today because okay i'll have to wait till i get in the office but can you go into that system and look at my account and just change Ontario or so it looks like you might be trying to log okay so your looks like you normally log into the database named cma copy with a username james but your password is math i can't see your password yeah so So did you have your password saved or did you change it? I don't see anything. No, I don't have it changed. Did you have it saved? What would you use before? Maybe your caps lock is on? Well, I'll check. Yeah, it could be something still there. My number lock is on or something. Okay, I'll check it again later. I'll try it again. All righty. But anyway, I just want to make sure. Yeah, just saying username and password. Actually, hold on one second. Yeah, today you tried to go to CMA. Today's the 23rd, right? Yeah. Yeah, you went in last week and you went in earlier today. Yes, I tried today with CMA copy there. Yeah, CMA copy. Yeah, so I choose my usual password. Yeah, maybe check the keys. that something's locked or something. Yeah, okay. I'll check it out. Okay, yeah, because it's just saying invalid username and password. Obviously, the username is right, so it's got to be what you're entering as the password. What I wanted to quickly connect, just to let you know that we're trying to resolve this. It's just a matter of getting in the system and having that drop down. Okay. Yeah, whenever you're back, just give us a call back or give me a call back, and then we'll set up a time. We'll go through it together. Just make sure we have it done right. Yeah. No, because I did go there and set up all the information, saved it. I went into auto pay, and I believe it saved that. It's just the only thing that was Ohio that's wrong. Yeah. And one of the reasons I certainly don't want to go into Ohio is I don't know really if it would affect taxes because we're in Ohio where you'd get, like, county taxes. So I just want to make sure it's selected correctly. Yeah. Okay. For customers that are in Ohio, we have to charge their county tax. Yeah. Okay. And I don't want you to get flagged later saying, oh, you never paid taxes when you were never supposed to. So. No, no, I understand. All right. So yeah, give me a call back when you, when you are back in the office and we'll go from there. Sound good? No, that's good. Thank you. You are welcome. Have a good vacation. It's raining, but we're supposed to get a nice date tomorrow, so I can't complain. That sounds better than working, right? Yes. Thank you. All right. Go enjoy. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
