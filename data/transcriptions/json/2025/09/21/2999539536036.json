Hi, Sharon. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just to confirm that the data was there and you were logging in. Everything was done with the data transfer to get your data over from Iowa City. I'm going to be entering the ticket to cancel that out and I just wanted to make sure you have the data that you needed. Please give me a call if there is anything more that you need or any questions or anything more that I can do. Or even let me know that the data is there and everything is running just fine. My direct is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks.",
