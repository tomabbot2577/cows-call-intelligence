    "text": " Hi, this is Robin. How are you? Okay, Robin. I got on that system and I created an account and I went to the vault thing. Okay. And I don't know what the hell. I tried to put in the CVV code or whatever the hell it's called. Okay. It's on the front of the card because that's the only... I got a new card. That's what the problem was. Okay. So I guess that little thing changes the CVV code. Now, is it the same card number? Yes. Okay. So I think what happens is like when it's the same card number, you can only delete it and then re-add it. That way you're being prompted that someone's not just kind of changing it for you. Do you have the card? I can help you with this because it's still showing as, let me pull it up again, Sharp Solutions. it is still showing an expiration i mean you don't have anything due right now you're good for now that was more like a head dot maybe i should have worded it better um because i happen to notice in going through a list of people who's either card just expired yours it looks like it expired in july so when you make your next payment it won't go through what i can do if it's okay with you week I can delete the card out that we have that expires and then re-add it is that okay with you you have that card with you okay so let me delete this one yeah hold on just a minute I gotta go get it okay Okay. And the other thing I found, too, is if you have it set up for auto pay, you have to turn the auto pay off on the card first and then delete it. It's above my pay grade. Yeah, I got it. I got you. Don't worry. You just take care of the old man. I'll take care of you. Yes, I will take care of you. All right. Otherwise, I'm going to tell Bill Kubitschek next time I'm in Hawaii. I love Bill. He's crazy. Isn't he funny? Oh, my God. He's so funny. He's one of the best sales guys I've ever seen in my life. He's so funny. Yeah, he's been crazy. When he just laughs, I laugh. Like, he's got the most contagious laugh, I think. Yeah, yeah. He's such a good salesman that I've sold about 200 users licenses. Wow. The PC Recruiter over the years. Nice. I really appreciate that. So it's, yeah, I should have got compensation from Bill, but he told me to go pound sand. Let's see, where am I? Okay, you need the number? Yeah, I'm going to have to redo all of it because I deleted out the card. All right. What is the name on the card? Okay, the actual name on the card is Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N-G, sharp, S-H-A-R-P. Okay. And then the card number. It's the name of the card. And then it's 3767-328-280-21000. Okay. 3767-328. Gosh, I need to be on my bigger screen. I can't see numbers anymore. 328-8- Sorry. Let me start over. 3767-328-280-21000. Right. Okay. The expiration date? 7-30. Okay. That's what went wrong on the old card. Okay. And then the security number? This is in American Express, right? Yep. Okay. Tell me the number. So that should be the four-digit number at the front of the card. 5134. 5134. And what's your state? North Carolina. Okay. North Carolina. What's the zip code on the card? 2750. I'm sorry, what was that? 27502. 502. Okay. I don't think I need address, but I think it will require state, zip, and country. Okay. Add card. Now, do you want me to put this on auto pay for you, this card? Yeah. Okay. All right. Hey, you know, I have a question, and I don't know if you're the right person to answer it, But what I was thinking about doing was I was thinking about possibly selling my database to multiple people. Because I'm about at the end of, you know, the trail. And I'm not selling the business. I'm just going to sell the database, the information. Okay. you guys got any problem with that i so as far as i know what we would do is whatever price you arrange we don't really have anything to do with that that's all on you and then i believe you would um pay like a you would have to sign like a release form to give that data to somebody else and then there might be some charges if we had to get involved to move it over i think they're pretty minimal though they're not too bad um but we don't do anything like as far as the pricing of it that's completely whatever you arrange oh yeah yeah yeah it's really just the release of it it would have to be like if there's like a form that they would have you sign and then um the person that we're giving it to might have some cost to like if it's an existing customer things like that. Now, the one thing that we can't do, let's say they are a Peace Recruiter user, we can't take your data and merge it into their database because there's too many tables that would be unrelated. So it'd be like a separate database for that customer. And then they could do like a move between roll-ups, but you don't get like everything. So it'd have to be like a separate database. It can't really be fully merged into their database. How come you know all this stuff because i've been here 19 years interesting yeah i'm an old time okay and the reason when you think about there's all these tables what if you have positions with the same id numbers or you know things like that like you know no i i got you yeah so but it's it's certainly possible as a separate database and for you it's just you come up with your price and then you sign it off but i mean i could do it i could do it a thousand times if i wanted to it's no problem right correct you just have to sign a form a thousand times yeah yeah that's cool yeah i gotta do i yeah i gotta i gotta make money somehow yeah you know ai is gonna put me out of business ai is a risky one and when people want to use ai it's a risky one i think there was like some wasn't there already some legal stuff about being not getting a somebody didn't somebody file a lawsuit against somebody for not being chosen because it was using AI to come up with it plus AI doesn't develop the relationship you have so make sure you point that out to your customer nobody cares about relationships anymore that's out the window isn't that sad well it's just it's the way it is I'm 68 years old, right? And I'm old school. I like to talk to a human being. I don't like to do stuff over the web that drives me freaking nuts, okay? And when I say I like to talk to a human being, I like to, let me qualify that, a competent human being, which is getting fewer and fewer. but you know the it's just a different world these kids they grow up with this stuff so the old farts like me you know most people my age are retired I'm not that far behind you 55 maybe 56 oh yeah you're still a baby I wish well you may not You may not be looking at it like that, but I mean, I was still in good shape at that age. I mean, I was still pretty. I don't know. Once I hit 50, it all started going downhill. Well, from 50 to 55, there was definitely, I noticed some, as they say in IT, system degradation. from 55 to 60 it was so I probably got probably from 50 to 55 was 10% from 55 to 60 was 20% okay from 60 to 68 oh oh don't tell me that's going to get worse that summer right before I turned 50 it was a rough summer I have colitis I had like the worst flare up of my life it was bad then I had like all bladder went it was like all within months of each other like I was in the hospital four times what your your your intestinal I mean your colitis is intestinal right yeah yeah well the first two so was it September or was it August I think August and September I think I went in each time six days and then like they had been high really high doses of prednisone which gave me um a blood clot and pneumonia and then prednisone is only one of those things you take short term like yeah yeah very very short term yeah yeah i was on it for like really high doses for like a couple months so yeah it's not good yeah so then i had that and then i started like i wasn't better but i was like you know getting somewhat back to normal. And then my gallbladder, and I'm like, what the hell? This turning 50 really sucks. It was all within like five months of each other. Did you have your gallbladder removed? Yeah. And it was so inflamed, they couldn't even get it out normal. I have this big scar now. It was like at 27 staples. It's supposed to be like little laparoscopy. They go in, you know, three little small holes. No, not me. So that was a lot of fun. Because it was too inflamed? Yeah. Do you have to take anything to aid your digestion? You know, I probably should because at first I was kind of chalking it up to all my colitis issues. But now after talking with people, I think it's more the gallbladder stuff. Like after eating certain foods, they just don't agree with me as well. Like really bad indigestion and stuff. Pineapple juice is like the worst. Yeah, but doesn't that produce bile? I haven't been getting that I know it was going bad when I was in the emergency room that's all I could taste and I'll just say get rid of was vile it was horrible right but that age in your digestion yeah it's not fun after like certain foods they really bother me that didn't before so it's a it's a i know my my buddy had colitis he said it was very painful yeah do you have a crappy diet or a good diet i'm in the middle i love i love my sweets and i like pasta but i i yeah good mix yeah good mix like i like to go to five guys and get a burger i don't really like McDonald's. I go to Five Guys. I can't eat it. Yeah, I'm not, you know, I mean, I'll eat a Big Mac when I'm traveling. You know, because you know, that kind of thing. I mean, if I eat seven Big Macs a year, that's a lot. Yeah, that's about like me. I just, they don't agree with me. So, I don't I have no problem with my own hamburgers. Yes, those don't bother me. Or even Five Guys. That's why I got there. Five Guys is pretty good. Yeah, they're pretty good. Yeah, those are fine. How's the food in Cleveland? Pretty good. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. We have a lot of good food places. A lot of good pizza, too. Really? Oh, yeah. Got a lot of Italians. In Cleveland? Mm-hmm. Yeah. A lot of Italians? Yeah. Especially in my area, there's a lot of Italians. Italians can cook, boy. Yeah. Yeah. My mother-in-law. She's from Italy. Are you Italian? No, I'm actually Irish, but my husband is Italian. Oh, okay. Yeah. His parents are from Italy, so... I tell you, I'm from, I'm from, I'm from Jersey. I mean, I spent most of my time in Jersey, Jersey shore, and I hung around with a bunch of schooners, Italian guys from, from New York, right? The biggest wise asses. I'm going to tell you something. And my first love was a Italian girl. And the, the, the, the Italian families, you know, people, I, I, you know, I'm down here in the South since 2006. And this other is always telling me how the people from New York or this, that, or the other thing. And I sit there and I go, what are you kidding me? They're like the friendliest people in the world. It's just that they're wise asses and they're sarcastic. And if you can't handle that, then you're in the wrong place. But I mean, the Italians will do anything for you. But if you cross the line with them, then you're dead to them. and that's how I am too I will do anything for you but in fact when I was years ago one of my Italian friends said oh my god you've got to see this show The Sopranos and I go why I go because you remind me of Tony Soprano and I go what do you mean because I didn't get HBO he goes well you're a big guy you're funny you do anything for anybody but the minute that somebody does something across the line, you want to whack them. And I go, I said, yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah. We watched that. That was like, couldn't wait for Sunday nights to watch that show. We loved it. Yeah. I get a kick out of it. But, you know, I knew so many of those guys. I mean, I had two of my friends from New York. Their dads were in the mob. And big, big Italian dudes. Holy. I mean, I was almost 6'4\". And these dudes were like, one of the fathers was 6'7\". And he was like 285 pounds. And he used to punch us in the arms all the time. and he used to say, I know you did something stupid, but, you know, okay, so now we're even, all right? And, but we would, you know, we got in trouble a couple times with the cops and he walked into the cop station and the whole place parted like the Red Sea and we walked out of there, no problem. It was like, it was beautiful, you know? So, I mean, I knew a whole bunch of guys that were like that and I got to be honest with you I never had a problem with the mob guys it was like if they said they were going to do something they did it but you better do what you say you're going to do it was all done in a handshake your word you know and I don't know I never had a problem I thought they were basically good guys you know yeah like I said I got a kick out of them because they're the biggest wise asses I've ever seen. You know, I mean, New York, New Jersey, forget about it. But anyway, so, so we are, but that's 100% though, right? I mean, I can, I can start, you know, I'm thinking about like maybe in a couple of weeks, starting to advertise on LinkedIn about, you know, buying the database. Yeah, I don't really know. Have you guys ever done that with anybody before? I mean, they've done it. You know what? Bill might actually be a good person to talk about. I don't really know because I guess, too, you know how much data is it? How old is it? How current? I mean, that could actually – I don't really know what people typically would charge for their data because I guess it would all depend on the industry. I've got over one and a half million records. Oh, wow. And, yes, a lot of it is dated. There's no two ways about it. every place I ever worked for the last 20 plus years, I, I, the, the, the first place I worked at when I was doing recruiting back in 98, okay, was a system integrator and they had plenty of money and they didn't understand the value of a database. And so I bought PC recruiter when it was local to your laptop. to your computer. Right? Oh, the old Windows version. Yeah, yeah. And so I found this other company that would scrape Monster, Career Builder, whatever the case may be, whatever pay for site. And, you know, I would, Career Builder, my God, one year I think I scraped 300,000 resumes. Right? And I was working at a place that was paying for a career builder, and then I was loading my database with it because they didn't want to buy it. They didn't want to buy the database. So I said, that's fine. And no problem. And so every place, it was either I was paying for it or they were paying for it or whatever. And, I mean, over the years, I mean, I'm asked a lot of resumes. and so I figure I mean it's got to be worth 40, 50 grand it's got to be I mean if I was getting into recruiting I would pay that I don't know if they go for that much Bill might Bill probably knows some stuff about it What the hell is his number these days? Can you email it to me? Yeah should be the same number it's not like a military secret or anything is it no no not at all here I'll just reply back on one of these emails check is it 440 is it 364 hold on one second I'm going to my cell phone do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do check 44036 7500 Alright, sending it to you now. so I will yeah I'd be interested to see what he thinks because he's the ultimate salesman right I couldn't shine his shoes that's funny well I'm good but he's great you know and you got to give it up no I always love Bill I like the Snyder guys too. I thought they were pretty good guys too. So I know that when I was trying to get various companies that I worked at over the years to buy PC Recruiter, I did get a few. I got a few companies to buy it, but they never utilized it properly. you know and I sure as hell wasn't going to load it for him because I knew that I was going to have my own company one day so I figured you know you do the work not me so but I don't play well in the sandbox of corporations too much well it's like Bill I'm sure Bill didn't either I mean, Bill's an entrepreneur, you know? Right. Most entrepreneurs are renegades, you know? He's definitely one of those. That's for sure. Yeah, they break every, they find every rule, they're going to break every rule they can, you know? And that's just the way it is. I mean, I can't help it. It's where I'm wired. I got one of those. My middle, I got three boys. My middle guy is a carbon copy of me. Oh, boy. Yeah. I mean, it's just the way it is. They can't, you know. Every one of those guys I hung around with from New York, every one of those Italian guys, I swear to God, I don't know how the hell any of them didn't wind up in jail because we were all wise asses. We had no respect for authority unless it was, you know, like a guy who earned it, we had no problem with, but, but, but usually the people that are, you know, imposing their authority on people are usually fearful little, pardon my French assholes, you know? And like, I'm always nice with people. I try, I try to be nice with people, but like when people start getting stupid with me, then the New York and New Jersey come out and then all of a sudden they go, Oh, what did I do? You know? And that's just the way it is. But you sent that to me, huh? Yes. And you got it. Yeah. What the hell? That's weird. Oh, okay. I just got it now. Cool. I'm going to give big bill a call and see what, see what his thoughts are. That'd be interesting. Okay. I appreciate your time today. No problem. Anything else? Let me know. Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks, Robin. You are welcome. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
