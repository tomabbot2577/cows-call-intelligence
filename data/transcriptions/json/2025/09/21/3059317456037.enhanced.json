    "text": " Thank you for calling me. This is Garrett. How may I help you? I'm sorry, who is this? Garrett. Garrett, okay. I recognize your voice. My name is Ann Subarich and I'm calling from Professional Search Network and I have a question in regards to how does it work if I want to drop somebody from – drop a seat and – or Or how does that work? And then would I also be able to keep the emails and the notes from the past? We're just basically trying to rearrange some things. And again, can the person work as an alias? So I don't know how that works. Okay, yeah. So there's the inside your database. you can keep a username and just disable access for somebody so that nobody can sign in under that username anymore. But for the billing or contract side of things, I would just have you reach out to your account rep. They'll take care of any changes in user accounts or the billing side. Let me check to see. It looks like you are currently at Professional Search Network with Jim Lombardo as your account rep here. And I can forward you over to him and he can help you with the actual changing of your number of seats. But yeah, in the meantime, if you did want to disable a username, I can show you how to do that in PCR. that was one of your goals? Hello, can you still hear me? Oops, I'm muted. Yes, can you help me with that, please? Sure, okay, no problem. So if you open up PCR and go to System in the main menu up at the top. Hold on, hold on. Let me just get out of here and go back in. Okay. Okay. I'm there. All right. And then go to Users on the left and Manage Users on the right. Okay. Then select the username you want to adjust from the list. Okay. Okay. And then in the bottom frame, let's see, the bottom frame, I'll have you go to security on the left. It's like a padlock icon. Okay. And then scroll all the way down. There's a heading to expand called security policy. Okay. And under that, it says account is disabled. You can check that box and then hit the save action button, the little floppy disk icon in the action menu. And that will make sure nobody can log in under this username anymore. But you will retain all of the information related to that username, such as emails and activities that have been created over time in the database. So all the emails and any entries and things like that. So I'm really not going to lose any information, just disable it from the previous person. Right. Yes. So nobody can log in under that username. OK, so then and so then with a new person, if I want to I mean, so I can't really just transfer that seat. Oh, you can. You can just create a new username inside of PCR. and yeah that's fine we won't even have to adjust the billing then and get you over to Jim Lombardo since you are taking away user and then adding a new one so that's totally fine I can send you if it would be helpful I have an article on how to create new users and also okay awesome yeah I'll send you that and I'll also give you instructions from our Learning Center on how to to connect up their email once the user is created. We just put a video on that article to help walk you through that as well. So let me send that. What's your best email address? Oh, go ahead. It's anne, A-N-N-E, at psnri.com. Okay. dot com. Okay. Got it. Professional Search Network Recruiter. Okay. Yeah. Professional Search Network Recruiters, Inc. Inc. Got it. Perfect. So then, so right now we have, then that would leave us with three users. So there's one user that doesn't really use it, but he, we have someone else that uses it, you know, and does like all the entries and stuff, but it's his seat. So how does that work if, can we add someone else's email on that seat? Basically the same person who would be entering information that they've been entering under that seat, Peter. so is there any way to like add her name on there so that she can go and change it to her account but still have an alias or how would that work you understand what I'm saying I think so so any username can have multiple email aliases so you can have that username and then send out from a list of different emails so it could be Peter's email and then somebody else's email and you'll get that option in the from field as you're about to send an email out. Do I want to send from this email address or this one? All under one username, if that makes sense. Okay, but I can go, okay, so basically I can say from this email or this email, but it's all going to be basically a drop down I can click and it's that easy. Is that right? Yeah, yeah. So you just have to add that email alias to the username. So it becomes an option to choose from when you're sending email. So let me let me find there's going to be an article for creating email aliases. I'll send that to you as well. Perfect. Perfect. So basically, I'll get you the creating a new user, that article, and then incoming email setup and outgoing email setup that you would do typically with a new user. But the outgoing email setup article will help in this scenario where you're just adding another outgoing email address or email alias to an existing username. Okay, okay, okay. Awesome. Yeah, let me just look if you could just, I'm just trying to see something. Security policy, I'm just looking under the one that is under Peter to see what I could click. Okay, that's right. I thought there'd be something else. All right, I'll look for that information, Garrett and thank you so much for your time I appreciate it no problem yes questions come up or you get stuck on any of those steps just let us know all right great thank you so much thanks have a good one",
