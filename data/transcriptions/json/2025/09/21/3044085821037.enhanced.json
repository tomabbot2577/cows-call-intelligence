    "text": " Thank you for calling MainSignature Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Tom Zelenay calling from Aspen Associates in Denver. I'm having a challenge with the PCR inhaler. The problem I'm having is when someone sends me a resume in Outlook as an attachment, if I click on the documents right click on it and select inhale a pop-up screen will pop up and it will show the status of it while it is inhaling and then afterward it used to show like that person that I could click on the name and and view the person that was just inhaled and it doesn't do that anymore okay so that's in Outlook I was working with Robin yesterday or the day before on that and she thought it was a setting that was in edge for notifications and pop-ups so we changed that but that didn't have anything to do with it but when I do inhale it it is traditionally it opens up PCR and edge versus Chrome which I usually use but it has worked in the past and it stopped working about a week ago. Okay so Edge, you check the Edge pop-ups. Are you using Windows as your machine? Okay let's check if you want to go to the search bar at the bottom of your screen by the Windows logo and just look for the settings so we can open up Windows settings okay and then said it's settings it says find a setting which does it have the settings app as part of Windows okay let's actually let's jump on a screen share it might be a little bit easier you just want to go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings that ring central calm try that again it's meetings plural and then a period okay meeting ID go ahead that is 454-891-564. Okay. Awesome. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Yep. and then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Okay, okay awesome. Yes if we go back down to oh yeah you're in settings now perfect then go to system on the left. Awesome. Then go to notifications and take off the do not disturb toggle the second one down. Kind of above that, yep. And then what you just expanded where it says to turn on do not disturb automatically, deselect those four check boxes that are already selected. Okay, expand the one that says focus as well a little bit lower. Okay, that's just if we wanted to start when we don't want that. Okay, go back at the top left and then scroll down we're looking for your browser maybe it'll say edge or Microsoft edge see oh it's all the way at the bottom I think there we go Microsoft edge go ahead and expand Microsoft Edge just by clicking on the arrow. Okay notifications are on. Notification Center. Try turning on the show notification banners as well on the left there. Yeah I would check that and then hit back one more time at the top left. And just in case we might want to check for Google Chrome too in case it's trying to get that notification sent through Chrome for some reason. I think that was listed towards the bottom as well. Okay, yeah, toggle that on and then click the arrow. Okay, and that's good. Alright, so let's try opening Outlook and seeing if we can get that notification to pop up now. So usually when I press OK then there will be a name here that I can click on and go to. There's not. Go ahead and close that pop-up and go to file in the main menu of Outlook and then at the bottom left go to options and where it says optimized for best appearance switch that in the middle there with the two radio buttons to the other one that says optimized for compatibility and okay so that'll require you to restart Outlook once before that setting will take effect but I think that's going to contribute to it as well yeah definitely check to make sure there's nothing you need to save And yeah, let's try it one more time. Fingers crossed, I think. I'll go back to Chase. I'll try him again. Yeah, that works. There we go. Okay, awesome. Perfect. Yeah, in the past, it wasn't popping up, and it doesn't always upload the person's right information. It may have first name Chase, last name Nurse, or something like that. So when I tried to look the person up, it's really a pain in the butt. Then you have to go to the resume and try to find a keyword and type it in that way to find it. So this is just a ton easier if it pops up and I see what it is. Yeah, I would recommend, too, when you click on that resume that's attached to the email, there's an other option next to inhale that says parse. That actually lets you look over the information before the record's created so you can see that the first name's in the correct field, things like that, rather than just inhaling. right above that yeah parse that will let you look that over first okay so after I do that then I just did you just hit save at the same right okay okay well maybe I'll change the way I do that that way we can just make sure we have the right people in the right fields the right names the right field actually okay awesome sounds good well thank you Garrett I really appreciate your help with that. That would have taken me forever to figure out. Yeah, no, no problem at all. And reach out if you notice anything else with that that's giving you trouble. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you again. Thanks. Bye.",
