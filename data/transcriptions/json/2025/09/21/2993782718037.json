Let me see if I can get Robin on the phone, see if she's still available. I got just a quick check. All righty. I'm going to try and cop this. Okay, here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. John? Yes. Okay. I was going to say, do you have that Zoom that we could jump right back in? Because Robin just chatted me and said she could jump back into the Zoom. If you have it, might be able to start it right now. You may have. You know, I checked my email about 45 minutes ago, and I didn't hear anything since our last exchange of emails. I'm not sure if that was looking for a Zoom link. I will send it over. I'll resend the invite to you right now. Okay. Okay, I just sent it right over. So that'll kick it up. It's going to be there. And let me hang up with you. If you would, I'll dial right into that as well. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Very well. Talk to you in a moment. All right. Bye now.",
