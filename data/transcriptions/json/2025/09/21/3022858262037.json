    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. It's Kaylin with Hawthorne Lean. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good, good. I wanted to reach out. I had sent in a ticket, I think it was last Tuesday or Wednesday, and I just didn't have any follow-up on the ticket, which was super abnormal. so I wanted to see if it was assigned to someone if we could kind of start to troubleshoot the ticket is about the default format our summary section for the profile changed from the paragraph form to being like one line if that makes sense Oh, okay, because that's because of the AI feature. Yeah. Yeah, so it's more like a formatted HTML. Okay, do you need that off? I can't follow up on that. We could turn it off for just that AI summary. Okay. Do you want to, like, let me see what yours looks like. Give an example of a person. Let me see here. So, yes, Jennifer Refuse, R-A-F-U-S-E. I think ideally we would love to switch it back to the default paragraph form. So if I did that, what's this pre-formatted option? You know what, if I switch this from pre-formatted to paragraph, it looks ten times better. Yeah, let me see. Yeah, it's strange. It used to be defaulted to the paragraph form, and it sounds like that changed with the AI update. I don't know why. Yeah, we're... Or did they? Yeah, because they didn't take out the thing. Can I just try in this one, like, if it looks better, if I switch it to paragraph? I wonder why I did that. Because really there was no HTML editor at all before. Let me see what that does for that. Let me look at the source code now. Okay. Let me go into one of my dead pieces. I don't want to have to summarize too many people, though. See, 9 says formatted. What's another person you have one? Another person would be Euclid Matthews. I saw the first name or first few letters. Yes, it's E-U-C-K-L-A-N. Why is yours? I've never seen it say pre-formatted. I switch it to paragraph. How was the setup? Did you have like spaces in between or things like that? or no before we just it was always the paragraph form and for some reason now you have to go in and like click paragraph and then it goes to the actual paragraph like view um but ever since that rollout it changed so that it's like one long line instead of the paragraph even though it says paragraph, which is very odd. I'm going to have to look into this. Because rather than take away a feature from you, I'm kind of wondering why it's saying, because the HTML code behind it is saying pre-formatted. I don't know if that was done intentionally so that you can at least flip it to where it's cleaner before you use it with this AI search. because the AI search basically what it's going to give you the ability to do is where you can have bullets and all the stuff you didn't have I'm not sorry not AI search the AI summary it will probably be keeping that going forward I believe where because people have been wanting where you can do basically format it just like a job description I see okay so ideally it'd be better too just when you want to use it flip it to paragraph hit save because if you go to like euclid matthews before i do any changes with this right if you went to summary yeah um go to the less than greater than symbol okay and there's like a pre-tag in there which i'm not really sure what the pre-tag is But if you switch it to paragraph, it swaps out that code to paragraph. Yeah. It gives it the right HTML tags. So before I take it away, I want to see if other databases are there. Mine's not doing that. Let me see. Interesting. Let me go to somebody else, although I don't know if they're going to have summaries. Probably not. And it's doing it for everyone on our team. So it's not just my team. I'm in another database now that has it. But I actually had that feature. Okay. Let me find out a little bit more on this. Now, do you want that HTML editing at all or no? That's a great question. I'd have to ask Karen what she wanted. I think the priority was us getting that format back to the paragraph. So if we get to choose one or the other, I'll have to check with her. I'm going to add a code in here real quick and see if it makes a difference. Let's see if that database just sent you. It's probably behind my other screen. Why do I open so many windows? Here it is. So easy to lose windows for me. Okay. um let me just see if i do something okay go back to Euclid now and hit summary okay yes now it's paragraph okay so really you don't have formatting by taking out the ai summary feature i see okay so okay so let me check with karen if because it sounds like if we take that away for everyone we won't have the AI option. Is that correct? Yeah. Basically for the AI summary feature to work on that trial, it has to have that. It also includes that formatting. I see. Okay. Let me check with Karen and see if she wants to permanently turn that off for us or if she wants to keep it and And then people just navigate to the paragraph button to change it. But I want to check with her before we do that for everyone. Okay. And then I'm just curious, do you see the support request in the system? I just want to make sure, like, my end for reaching out to PCR wasn't wrong. It was so odd. Yeah, it was assigned to McKenzie. Okay. Where did I find? Let's see. It looks like I thought there was a reply on it. I'll go back to it again. Hold on. It was assigned to McKenzie. Yeah, I think, let's see. Caitlin replied, that's you, four hours ago and then five days ago. Maybe just think of a follow-up in it. Okay, I'll just tag him in here. Yeah, that'd be great. Because I responded a few times and there was still no response. So I just want to make sure there's not something weird going on with my email and the support team. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, I'm just going to let them know that I took away the feature for now. Okay. Okay, perfect. I will reach out to Karen, and then I'll just respond on this ticket if she wants to keep the AI. All righty. All righty. Okay. Thanks, Robin. Have a good one. You too. Bye. Bye.",
