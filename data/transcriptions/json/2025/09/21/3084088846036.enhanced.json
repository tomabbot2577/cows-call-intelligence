    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Ernie Bivona. I cannot get PCR to load. Yesterday, it would only go, when you hit the URL, it would only go part way. And I don't know, and I try to get rid of history, but I can't get it to load the full way. I don't understand the issues. Yeah, I can walk you through specific steps on how to clear the cache. That might help. Let's try that. So if you're on the screen that isn't loading, just start by going to the three dots at the top right of the browser. Right. And then go to more tools towards the bottom. And then developer tools. Uh-huh. and that'll open up a window of stuff that you can just ignore, leave that off to the side, and then right-click on the refresh button. That's going to be to the left of your web address up at the top, the www. It says normal reload, hard reload, empty cache, and hard reload. Awesome. Choose the third option, empty cache and hard reload, and that should slowly kind of refresh the page and reload everything and hopefully that's all it needed. Well, let's see. I think so. I'll let you know in a second. Okay. Yep, there we go. That's working good. Okay. How did that happen? What's the deal? causes that to happen? I think that your cache, it's like stored data related to your browser, just gets full and it's hard to load like our session-based website when all that information's full. So yeah, clearing cache helps sometimes. If you want, I can actually email you those steps in case you need to do that in the future anytime. Would that be helpful? no I got it because I had gone initially to history and go I gotta go find where the cache is so I got the theory so I go okay and then because usually you just go into Chrome and up pops the you know the direction for it and you just hit that and up now while I have you though PCR capture tool they said there's a whole bunch of new stuff what's the the cliff notes version on the oh um the capture tool uh we had two major updates um where you can now just pull up a company's profile on linkedin rather than a person's profile and capture the company um and then the second thing is you can highlight a block of text on any website now so So maybe you're on like a website that has a person's name and their email address and their job title listed under their picture. You know, some random website. You can highlight that text, right click it, and there'll be an option to capture that information as a new name record. So it'll actually make it a name record. right yeah yeah any so yeah it doesn't have to be one of those websites that we are initially compatible with you can highlight text on any website now what about sometimes companies will list their products or their marketplace that you know these are the markets into which we sell would that could i capture that information and load it into notes there's nothing with the capture tool that would help with that you would still just kind of have to copy and paste that over to a company record but yeah you could use this highlight and right click on instances where you do want to create a new name record or a new company record okay sounds good let us know if you have any other questions alrighty appreciate it thanks bye",
