    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. You have not... Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise... You are in the meeting now. There are three participants in the meeting. It's showing that my video is on, but it's not showing me. Your little slider is not closed, is it? Or you're not on the laptop camera with the lid closed? No, I've got the Logitech one, and it's open. The slider's not over it. Let me try. Let's see. It's usually when it's a full black square, it means like the camera is closed. Like the . Yeah. Oh. You know what? I'm going to log out and come right back. Sounds good. I fixed it, Chris. That did it. I don't know what it was. Yeah, sometimes a good old-fashioned leave and come back or reboot. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. So I wanted to chat with you today. I think we're going to take a look at some of the premium features of PC Recruiter that you all don't have right now. And wanted first to kind of see if anybody had heard of the premium features. Are you familiar with any of them? Do you have any particular interest in any of them? I'm going to show them all, but any initial thoughts? I'm not sure we're aware of what they are, so if you could give us a quick overview, that would be helpful. Fantastic. Fantastic. So what the premium package, so you're in the enterprise package of PC Recruiter, which is the base package of PC Recruiter. The Enterprise Package would actually add an email campaigns feature to be able to set up mass emails. There's also a nice reporting tool so you can see clicks, opens, unsubscribes, replies, kind of see the results of your mass emails. Building on that, there's also going to be a sequencing piece. So there's a sequencing of drip campaigns engine within PC Recruiter so you can build your own sequences. So you could say, send an email, pause five days, send a second email. If they maybe open that one, put them on a call list. If they don't, send them a text through RingCentral. So that is going to be included. And then also the analytics reporting that will include all of the custom reports, as well as the reporting on your email campaigns and sequences and stuff like that. And I think I might have talked with Tina once about sequencing some time back. I think that's how we eventually arrived at this. So I do want to show you just some of the things that the PC Recruiter does that might be of interest to you there. So I'm going to share my screen here. All right. And you should be looking at my sign-in screen for PC Recruiter. Do you see that all right? Yes. Fantastic. So I'm going to go ahead and get myself logged in. So the biggest thing, kind of the biggest thing you would notice, there's not any change to the look and the feel or anything like that, but the premium package adds some additional tiles up top here, sequencing, analytics, the email campaigns pieces in there as well. So the analytics kind of ties everything together. This is going to give you the ability to build custom reports within PC Recruiter based on anything relating to the pipeline activities or custom activity types. So if you wanted to look at something like pipeline activities, I've chosen to build a report here that only shows first interviews, second interviews, and phone screens. But you could include every interview step you have in your pipeline if you wish. You also, when you're pulling these reports, can go ahead and pull them for different periods. Last year, this week, last week, make a custom range. So you can kind of pick and choose what data set you want to look at in what period of time. Then once you have that data, you can also, with one click, narrow it down by job. narrow it down by client you worked with narrow it down by recruiter I only have one so it's only showing me or you can even build teams if you want so you can actually work with your data to see what's going on and this is going to be something that will allow you to build reports off of any pipeline related activity or any related activity that you might have in the system like names added companies added incoming calls email sent any number of different things so pretty much anything you can get into PC recruiter as far as activity is going to be able to be part of these reports and you can create goals and KPIs and different things in here as well these analytics are also going to contain the reporting for your email campaigns so email campaigns is a whole different section on the report and that's going to show every email campaign that you sent and it's going to show you an instant report of how many people opened it how many people clicked one or more of the links how many people replied unsubscribed or bounced and cool thing about it is if you scroll down you can actually click into see who clicked and you can see who clicked what when how many times so you can see all that information there you can also see who opened it so you can see who opened your email when they opened it there so you have a little bit of stats here you can even see replies bounces it'll even tell you if it was a hard bounce like it no longer exists or a soft bounce just a vacation or out-of-office responder so all that data is going to be reported upon within the email campaigns report piece here the sequences are also reported on here as well so that's kind of one big piece is this whole analytics dashboard it is customizable by user so you could give certain users certain views and maybe certain users don't see each other's or something like that and And then the email campaigns piece is also a large part of what this does. So if you send bulk, do you send any bulk emails right now through PC Recruiter? Yeah, she's shaking her head no. No, I think mostly they're using it to post the jobs on the web. They're not sending out advertisements to anyone. Perfect, perfect. And those emails, many times it is advertising jobs or something like that. But sometimes it's a little email to update your contact information with us. You'll give them a little link and they can click in and update their contact information in your database through a little portal So you can kind of space those out you can send 50 a day or you can put a pause between each send or anything like that You're also going to get hit the sequencing piece and the sequencing is going to be a little more engaging to people That is going to let you build a template in here and maybe you have one for business development perhaps If I go in and look at my branches, I'm able to kind of build a custom process here that the very first step is going to be send this specific form letter. If they reply to it, they're done with the sequence. They read it. That's what I cared about. If they don't interact with it in three days, move to the next step. That'll add them to a call list. And then I'm going to have on my task list that was just up a minute ago when I opened up the sequencing piece, that task list is going to show me all of the calls I have. And then when I make each individual call, I can also click dial with RingCentral. You can populate a script in there if you wanted to when I make said call it's going to be able to it's going to be able you can select one of these options so you can select it was connected that'll complete the sequence or left message moves to the next step which could be another email so the sequences could be straight up your campaigns using only emails or it could be something that might include calls texts other items that might end up here on your task list so this is especially helpful if you're doing business development maybe these are all the the contacts of the companies you're trying to market toward and if I look I've got 18 of them had opened my email I know they're on my call list so I can go into the first person it's going to give me a little synopsis of their fields their activities there's my script I can hit dial to call right from there and then that's going to let me mark them as whatever no answer not interested whatever and it would then talk or write to the next person so I'm to be able to kind of go through there. So it does include these sequences within PC Recruiter as well. So it's kind of a nice piece. It also includes a contract and temp features if you're looking to track timesheets and stuff, but not a lot of people are using those. Okay. Any questions? Anything that was of interest? No, I appreciate you running through it, but I'm not sure that we've utilize those services. Okay and that may very well be why you never had them because it wasn't anything you were looking for or anything like that. Yeah if you're using it just for posting jobs do you have the new pipeline? That would be one thing no cost to add it but I just want to make sure you have it. It would be I'm going to go into it here into one of my job openings and if you're doing any kind of posting collecting your applicants the new pipeline is going to be an easier way to track people through the pipeline process. Do you have the pipeline looks like this? Cheyenne, do you know? No. It doesn't look like that currently. Okay. It looks like you're on the older pipeline. It looks more like Outlook. It's got folders and you drag and drop and everything like that. Well, this new pipeline is something that was released a while back. It wasn't applied to every record. I mean, it wasn't applied to every database automatically because what it did, it switched your whole process. So if you upgraded this new pipeline starting that day, every new job would run under the new pipeline, but the old ones aren't converted. So you have to finish up your few older pipelines, but the new pipeline is going to be a lot easier to use More colorful you have up to 18 steps and as you move through you're able to just drag and drop And then that's going to create that searchable trackable reportable event You can also have multiple pipelines if you want. It's a little bit easier to look at you also could look at a list view So if you wanted it, you know, whoops too quick there if you could you could have a list view to drag up and down something like that so if you were interested in this no cost to do it i can throw in a ticket if at any time you wanted to do it and you could upgrade to that okay that's something we can certainly talk about and figure out if we think we can make use of it thank you certainly certainly yeah i think we're looking so it sounds like we want to stay on the version that we're currently on like as far as like we don't want to upgrade from our current to enterprise. I don't think there's a need, no. That's kind of what was the purpose of the meeting, so that's good enough. Good to explore nonetheless. Right, right. So, Jim, this is where we wanted to move to an annual contract, so we'll just need, I think we just paid our bill for July. I think I just got an email that the July bill went through. I think it was on the 20th. Yeah, so if we could get a quote for an annual contract starting in August that runs August to August, we're going to do a PO to pay for a year in advance. Okay. I will go ahead and get something set up. It could just be a quote in an email. Would that be okay? Yes, it has to have your, like, you know, the company, like, letterhead kind of, you know, with the address on it and all that kind of stuff, so that we can include it with our purchase record. Perfect. Yeah, I will go ahead and draw something up and get it over to you. And you are still the same package. Obviously, I'm not upgrading that. And I have you at four users. Is that still correct? Yes, because we just added. We made that change, yeah. Yeah, we made that change recently. Yep. Yep, I remember that. Perfect. So I will go ahead and get that on out to, and that was Tina? Was that you speaking that I should send it to? Yes, yep, yep. You can send it to me. We're going to work with our, I'll work with our admin to get that PO going for an August payment. Fantastic. I'll go ahead and get it on out in the next day or so, and then we can work to get that moved over. Great. Jim, thanks for your time. I appreciate it. My pleasure. Thanks, everyone, for the time. All right. Have a great day. All right. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, everyone, for your time. Tina, thanks for organizing. All right. Take care, everyone. Bye-bye.",
