    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? I'm not sure you can help me, Garrett, but I'm going to give it my best shot. All right. Hold on just a moment, please. All right. Okay. Okay. I'm with Summerfield Associates in Memphis. Okay. And I am trying to inhale or parse a resume, and I am not having any luck. Okay. Are you doing that through Microsoft Outlook or just on your web browser like Google Chrome? No, Microsoft Outlook. Okay. Do you know if you are using Microsoft Outlook Classic or Microsoft Outlook New? I guess it's new because we updated our computers, so I guess it would be the new. Okay. So our add-in is what it's called. Our add-in for Microsoft Outlook is only compatible with the classic version of Outlook. Microsoft doesn't allow third parties to have add-ins on their new version, so we're kind of locked out of that. we can check to see, I could give you quick instructions here to see if Microsoft Outlook Classic is still on your computer. So if you go to the bottom of your screen by the Windows logo, there should be a search bar down there. Search bar. All right. What am I going to search for? Just look for Outlook and then hopefully one of your results will say Outlook Classic. No, it just brings up my email. Okay, so when you typed in Outlook in that search bar, did it have any programs listed as search results? It would be, it's a search bar way at the bottom of your screen, as far down as you can go, right next to the Windows logo. Well, I'm probably not in the right place then because I'm not. Okay. No worries. Okay, so if you look at the very bottom of your screen, are you seeing like a date and time at the bottom right? I'm not sure I'm even in the right spot since I've gotten this new one I'm having trouble navigating it and I'm really not sure where I'm supposed to be and that's kind of been my biggest problem hopefully we can get you back over to the Outlook Classic if you still have that So, are you looking at the very bottom of your screen, bottom right? You should see a date and time. Is that visible? Yeah, 11-24-7-17. Perfect. Yeah. So, on that same row, if you go to the left more, you should see a search bar. In Nikon, OneDrive. It's more on the left side of the screen. If your date's on the right, this search bar will be on the left side of the screen on that same row as the date. I don't see a search bar on the left side. Okay. Is there any search bar like in the center among those icons? No. Okay. I don't see any. Do you see a Windows logo anywhere on that bar at the bottom? Microsoft Edge, Word, Excel. It would be farther left than that. There's a start, and when I bring it up, it shows me what's been pinned, which is Edge, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft 365, Outlook, Microsoft Store, Photos. Okay, so when you're hitting start, does that give you a place to use a search bar anywhere? Is there a search bar near that start button? Well, there is in this particular right here. Okay. And I clicked on it, and it says get started, Microsoft Edge, email an account, check for update, paint them. Got you. Okay, so those are all your programs there when you click on start. And if you do see a search bar when you click on start, we want to type in Outlook there. O-U-T-L-O-M-A, Outlook. All right, and then hit enter on your keyboard. I see Outlook Classic right now. Excellent. Click on that. We want to open that version of the program. All righty. All right. And it comes up open, new emails, new appointments, new meetings, new contact, new tasks. Okay. And it should be launching Outlook Classic on your computer. And it should look kind of more familiar since the update to Outlook New. Well, I don't use Outlook New. I've been going back to the old. Oh, good. Okay. Yeah. So that's Outlook Classic. Gotcha. All right. So did Outlook Classic open up on your computer already? No. Okay. Let's see. Let's try jumping on a screen share meeting. Maybe that will help and I'll be able to see your screen. So you're going to want to go to a website. So open up your browser, and I'll give you a web address when you're ready. All right. I'm ready. That is meetings.ringcentral.com. Ringcentral.com. Meetings. Ring. Central. C-E-N-T-R-A-L.com. All right. and make sure there's a period in between meetings and ring central so meetings.ringcentral.com i got it all right let's see it come on come on there it's working a new tab okay all right air calls aren't closed ring central meetings RingCentral Solutions? It should be prompting you to put in a meeting ID. Check that web address again. Make sure it says meetings, plural with an S, meetings, period, ringcentral.com. All right. Let's see. M-E-E-T-I-N-G-S dot ring, R-I-N-G, central, C-E-N-N-T-R-A-L dot C-O-M, right? Excellent. Yep, and hit enter. That should get you to the right place. Ah, join a meeting. Perfect. And let me know when you're ready for the ID. Okay, cool. So the meeting ID is 960-738-963. 960-960-963. Join. Perfect. Enter my name? Yeah, just put any name. That's fine. Okay. Let's see. Cool. I see you've joined. So do you get any pop-ups asking you? Yes, it says allow while visiting the site, allow this time, and never allow. Allow while visiting the site. That's good. Got it. All right. Now it comes up. Choose how to join audio, microphone or HG24. Say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Gotcha. All right. And then finally, click on the blue share button down at the bottom and select entire screen up at the top. Share. Entire screen. And then just click on screen one to select it. You should be able to hit share at the bottom right. Excellent. That's loading on my end. Great. I can see that. All right. So it does look like you have Outlook Classic and Outlook New kind of both open. so down at the bottom of your screen with those icons in the gray or in the tan bar right click on the outlook logo that's kind of in the middle the the blue one just right click on it this one yeah right click on that okay go to close window excellent and then all the way to the right is your outlook classic that's the right one go ahead hover over that and open one of those. Excellent. So this one, oh there you go. So this one doesn't look like it has the Outlook add-in, the PCR Outlook add-in installed yet. So we'll have to install that and also get you Java and Launcher. So let's go back to Google Chrome, your browser, down at the bottom there. Perfect. And then, oh, yeah, if you click on that black preview box on the left, the black preview box, that'll click it and select it to open it. Perfect. Go ahead and add a new tab up at the very top. and go to java.com, J-A-V-A.com. And that should load up here in a second. Taking a while to load. go ahead and click on that web address again to highlight it and hit enter. It'll try going to that web address again. There you go and just hit enter on your keyboard. Huh. That is strange. Okay, to the left of the web address is an icon that looks like an arrow in a loop. To the left of the web address. At the top? Yeah, so where you were clicking on that web address a second ago, java.com. Go to the left of that. Yeah, go to the left of that. There's an arrow in a loop. Click on that. That's to refresh the page. Okay. Still nothing. Okay. I am not sure. Java.com slash EN slash is what came up. Yeah, that just, I think, bringing it to the English version of the website. But you can click on that and backspace the EN just to see if that's causing any problems. Let's go to Java.com. Let's see if that helps. It still comes up that way. Okay, let's just try going to, maybe go to google.com. Okay. And then in that search bar where it says the lake, backspace that and put in Java, J-A-V-A. All right. And hit enter. Okay. And then below that AI overview, it says Java Oracle. Click on that. Okay. Okay, taking us to the same issue. Try hitting back maybe at the top left. Yeah. And go to download Java. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully that'll work. There we go. Okay. Let's see, I'm not sure, this isn't the usual page that we see. Scroll up to the top again. All right. And go to the top where it says Java for desktop apps. There we go. Click on Download Java for desktops. That will start a download at the top right of your screen. And once that completes, we'll open the file to run it. Okay. Yeah, when I got this new computer, I lost everything, and I'm having to go back and download everything, and I'm just not. Now it's going to where I need the password. Yeah, so if you need passwords in order to install something, that might be something that either you have or your IT department has or an admin. Yeah, I got a call into my IT guy. Okay. So he's going to have to do the Java. Yeah. He's going to have to do the Java too, isn't he? Yep. There's three programs that we need to install. Okay. What I could do is actually give step-by-step instructions to install the three programs, and then maybe you could forward that to your IT person, and they can let me know if they get stuck on any of the steps that would work oh he won't get stuck he's great oh awesome but I just put a call in to him and I'm not sure what I need to just tell me the apps I need to install You'll need Java, PCR Launchers, the second one, and the PCR Outlook Portal is the third one. Portal. Okay. And while we're here, at the bottom of your screen, let's get rid of that Outlook New icon so you don't accidentally open that one. So right-click on the Outlook icon in the center at the bottom. Right-click on it. That one there. Yep. Right-click. Right-click. Okay. And then Unpin from Taskbar. Perfect. And then right-click on the one at the end, the correct one. Right-click on that. and go to pin to taskbar there we go so that one will be readily available can use Outlook Classic moving forward. Right, right. So, yeah, what is your email address? I could just email you the instructions for completing those three downloads, and then Okay, okay. You can forward that to whoever. Yeah, I can do that. It is the letter K. All right. M-C-L-A-N-E at Okay. Summerfield, S-U-M-M-E-R-F-I-E-L-D dot net. Perfect. All right. I will send those instructions shortly here. And like I said, give us a ring back if there's any trouble or you get stuck on anything. Okay. Garrett, I really appreciate your time and effort with me. Happy to help. Thanks. You have a good day. All right. You too. Bye. All right. Bye-bye.",
