    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Alexia. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Doing good. Doing good. I am on my PCR dashboard right now. My boss has tasked me with fixing a couple things in analytics. I tried my best to do it myself, and I'm having a bit of a hard time with it. I added some values in for placements revenue and for some reason in our key metrics everything has gone blank and saying not available including the revenue tab that we have here. So I just wanted to see if maybe we can help out with that. Let's see hold on one second here let's see. Wow, I opened a lot of databases today. Let me just clean out some stuff here. Bear with me one second. I've got to find my screen to get to information about our customers. Okay, this is, these are all client editors. Oh my gosh, this is crazy how many things I've opened. How do I do this to myself? I get it. I feel that way too sometimes. Oh my gosh. And I swear, like ever since I got two screens or, you know, like a second monitor, it's like 10 times more. I'm a huge multitasker. Who knows what I'm in. I jump from one thing to the next constantly. Okay, let's see. Getting closer. Unless I close it down. That could be. All right, I'll just go back in. Okay, what is the company name? It's a trusted human capital. Okay. Okay. So trusted human capital? Yes. Is it Trusted Human Capital? Yes. Would we have you a different way? Or what's your last name? It's a brew, A-B-R-E-U. My username is Alexia, my first name. It could be under Career Building Solutions, but I don't use that database. I use the Trusted Human Capital one. Yeah, I'm just going to see. Oh, there it is. Okay. Career Building Solutions is how we have your company listed. Gotcha. Let me see. Okay, so you said the database was Trusted Human Capital. Yes. And what was your PCR username? Alexia. Okay. And I should have full admin capabilities. Okay. So what is it that you did under your data set configuration? So, yeah, so I was able to add, like, I went into all of our recent placements for 2025, and I added specifics in there for the placement. So like exactly how much, you know, revenue we've taken in. And in our key metrics under business development and recruiting key metrics, everything just says not available. And they used to not say this. It used to give actual figures. Okay. So if you go under administration, go to data set configuration. Yeah. there is a page main placement a page named placements and revenue and then revenue but there's nothing in there okay now however those would just be like counting step types so i don't think you're really going to need it for that okay um what you would do instead is just go to um instead of under metrics you go under placements and then there's like a summary time value is that where you're trying to look you're just trying to see your placement so yeah my my boss wants us to have like literally like a figure um an analytic that says how much money we've made since january basically okay like that would not be a data set configuration that's just something we pull from the placement so i think under administration under data set, you can get rid of those last two that you see below at the very bottom. Okay. Okay. I just deleted them. Okay. So, because the data sets are more like where you see like the blocks or groups, we call them, where it's counting either a pipeline step or an activity type. So, neither one of those are. Well, while we're in data set, is there a reason why all the other things are not, all the other tabs are not reflecting correctly? Because they used to also reflect well? It depends what you mean by reflect well. So anytime I put somebody in a pipeline step for like a client submittal or an interview, like all the steps that we have set, it used to reflect in the key metrics. Like it would say one, two, three, whatever it was. And now it just, everything just says not available. It could be the filters that you have maybe or who it's assigned to. So let's go over the placements first and we'll have to look at that because that would be something completely different. Because key metrics are based on a data set, but then having a goal and then that being in key metrics, which is different than just metrics or placement. Key metrics are more like goal based. So it could be that you don't have goals. We'll have to look at that in a moment. If you go under placements now though, you'll see like summary, by time, by value, so that's, or by employee. So you'd have to look at your filters, like if you're looking at mine or other users, which database, and then the time frame. But that information just pulls from that section, from the placement record. Gotcha. Now for your, let's go back to administration and then let's look at configure key metrics. So you've got a recruiting key metrics that's assigned to three different users, meaning that's who has access to and can be counted. Yeah none of this has changed in years actually unfortunately. Okay, so it could be that But you don't have goals. So under administration, if you go to goals. Uh-huh. We've never filled out goals before either. And that's what's so weird. That's why it would not work. Because they're all goals-based. Okay. Yeah, that's so weird. We've never set goals before. And it used to reflect. So that's, I guess, why I was kind of confused as to what happened. Because one day it was there and then the next day it wasn't. For the key metrics, basically what it is is saying if you had a goal for, like, for example, how many clients submittal? It'll say, like, okay, what you have versus your goal. And that's what you see at the top of your key metrics page. Okay. Got it. Like, let's see. What's in your design for, like, recruiting key metrics? Like, you have initial interview scheduled. initial interview conducted, internal submittal, you would have to have a goal for those that you see in the design portion. Okay. So, like, let's see. So, if you go to administration, go to data set. I'm sorry. Under administration, go to configure key metrics. So, you got two pages in there. Yeah. And then when you go to action, you'll select design. Okay. These are based on those groups you have in your data sets. So these are the ones that you'd have to have a goal for those. So for like initial interview scheduled, if you go over to goals, look for initial interview scheduled. And then for each year, you have to put in that user's goal. Okay. Got it. All right. And you also want to make sure the users are assigned to it as well. Gotcha. Okay. I forgot to figure that one out. And then, yeah, as for revenue, like, is there any way I can get my boss, like, this revenue tally for the year somehow, some way? Well, it's only based on the placement fee field. But if you go under placements and go to summary, if you look down at the bottom and you could even slide um that bottom section up so you don't see the bubbles you see the data uh-huh you kind of drag and drop it up so it's showing 81,678 okay got it so that would be the place to find it then there would no there wouldn't be like any other um I guess, I don't know. I think you've probably spoken with Mike before, my boss. He's actually recommended me talking to you, Ross, before. He's crazy. But he, like, wants, he has all these requests, these crazy requests that he wants me to go ahead and try to do for him. I mean, the other thing, if you didn't want to run an analytics, you could maybe do, like, a report. But, I mean, you've got it right here. Yeah. So it depends, like, what users. You might have to say, like, all users, which databases, your time frame. That's all dependent on your filters at the top. Okay. Got it. Got it. And I'm seeing here, let me see. What's that coming up as zero? That's a Capasso comes up as zero. How can I, and so does Kai here. How do I fix, um, like an old, I guess, placement? Um, I'm seeing like two of mine here showing $0 in revenue. You would have to go to that position record within Peace Recruiter, not within Analytics. And there's a placements tab. Okay. And then if you open, the date is the link to open the placement. You'd have to make sure you put in the amount for the placement fee. Got it. Oh, okay. Got it. I see. now just keep in mind your analytics pulls data every 15 minutes so when you make the change you have to wait for the next data pull okay actually show up okay perfect no this this actually helped me a lot i'm going to let him know that um to find the revenue he's going to have to go to there and then i'll set some goals for the other um for the analytics okay yeah all right perfect thank you so much all right no problem have a good day you too bye",
