Make sure PC Recruiter is working okay for you. I noticed your training ticket had been closed after 30 days of no activity, so I wanted to see if you needed any further training on our end or if there was anything more we could do to help you use the PC Recruiter. Please give me a call. Let me know. My direct is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. We'll talk to you soon. Hope you're well. Bye-bye.",
