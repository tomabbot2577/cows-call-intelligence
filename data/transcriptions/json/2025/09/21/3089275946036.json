    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yes, this is Rob Houghton. I have an account there at PC Recruiter. I'm having trouble with my emails. I haven't gotten an email since, believe it or not, yesterday at like 12 noon. And I don't think it's a problem on Main Sequence because I went to my Outlook account and I didn't see any emails coming through. But I'm wondering if you could just take a look at my email set up and make sure everything's OK. Yeah, let me pop in and take a look here. And then which username do you use? OK, and you're logging into the MR Fairfax database? Yes. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Let me just pop in and take a look here. Yep, everything's authenticated correctly on the PCR mail side. So everything looks good, huh? Let me just double check here. Yeah, and I'm even seeing some emails in here from today. Really? Some test emails that you sent. Yeah, yeah, but the only one that came through on my Outlook was test six. That's the only one that came through. that's the only one I'm seeing as well so yeah it looks like nothing after before 12 you're seeing the exact same thing in Outlook yeah so it's definitely a problem at the GoDaddy end the ones that host my email yeah I would reach out to them and see yeah are there any specific questions that I should be asking them Let me just double check to make sure. Yeah, I would just ask them if they're having any issues with email deliverability. messages coming into inboxes. Okay. All right. I'll get with them. Thank you very much. Yep, no problem. Have a great day. All right. Bye.",
