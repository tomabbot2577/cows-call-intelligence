Yeah, I appreciate you doing that. So we're going to be winding down our agreement with PCR Main Sequence, and I wanted to know what steps we needed to take to make sure we give notice that is needed, if any, as well as to get our data. Okay. Give me one second. I think it might be best to speak with your sales rep, which I think at this point is going to be Jim Lombardo. Give me one second. Let me see if he's available and I can maybe transfer you over there. But if not, is it okay if I send you Joe's voicemail? Absolutely. Okay. Give me one second. I appreciate the callback. Yeah, it looks like he's in a meeting right now, but I can send you to his voicemail. Okay, that'd be perfect. Thank you. Okay. Yep, absolutely. You have a good day.",
