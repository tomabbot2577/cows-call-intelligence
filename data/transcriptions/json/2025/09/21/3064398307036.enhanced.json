    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Al Bourne. I think we just spoke. Yeah. How's it going, Al? Good. I got up to the AWS where it's installed Amazon Coretta 8, and then I didn't know where to go from there. So in that box, like you'll see that there's a box full of downloads on that page? you'll scroll in that box until you find Windows x86 okay I think I did that one farther along than that and then you clicked on the link to the right where it said JDK I think so yeah right now I'm on Amazon Corretto 8 installation instructions yeah so you just click through that download like you'll hit like the next installs parts I'm in the it talks about a .msi file from the downloads page Microsoft Download Center so you clicked on the link right that download link next to the JDK yeah I believe that then you would need to go into your downloads folder and click on the link that link in there to run the file I don't think I downloaded anything yet I think I just got this far Well, if you click on that link, that MSI link that's next to the JDK, you'll see it pop up into your downloads folder. Okay, I didn't see that happen. Back to the boxes. So I hit the Windows x86 JDK, and there's two within the JDK. But you'll click the first one, the top one. Okay. Oh, now I see it downloading, yes. Yep, and so you'll just run that file when it's done downloading. Okay. That's a lot less confusing. Yep, and then once you download and install that, you'll go back to our PC Recruiter Downloads page and just click the one that says PCEXE, and that'll do the download link for you. Let me just see. The second one is, what was it? You'll go back to the PCR downloads page. Yeah. And then under the launcher, you'll see one that says PC and then in parentheses EXE. Yeah, okay. Okay, so I've installed the other ones since we were talking. So now I'll just go back to the PC recruiter. Yep. Okay, I think I got it. Yep, and then you'll do just the same thing with that one. Okay. All right, I'll give that a shot then. Yep. Now, if you run into any issues, just give us a call back. All right. Thank you. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye.",
