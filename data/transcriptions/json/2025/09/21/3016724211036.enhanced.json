Hi, Soma. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just to circle back. I got your cancellation request today. Just had a couple questions for you. I wondered why you were looking to cancel your PC recruiter account, what was lacking, or where else you're going, perhaps another software or something. And I also needed to know if you did need a data return to be able to process that. You would have an early termination fee also. It looks like your contract goes through January. So I wanted to let you know about that too. But please give me a call. Let me know. And then I can get this in process for you. 440-856-0314 is my number. 440-856-0314.",
