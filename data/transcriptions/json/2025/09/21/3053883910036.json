    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. It's Jim Quinzane, Recruiting Solutions Network. How are you? Hey, Jim. Great. Happy Friday. Happy Friday to you as well. I just had a quick question, if you could maybe walk me through a briefing. Yeah, what's going on? Well, if I was going to search for a civil designer in, like, a certain area code, what do I do? Do I click on the title and click civil designer under names? How do I do it? Yes. So you do name up at the top, and then that would bring you to your basic search screen. Oh, we're way up on top? Basic search. And then where it says first name, you can go into that drop down and select title. Hold on. So I click on the basic search, that little, what is that called, glass, that optical glass or magnifying glass. I click on that. Not yet. You have to put in the criteria for the search first. Okay, so go to the title and click, do I have civil designer? Okay, and then, so I don't put any key, do I put anything under keywords? Nope, but where it says last name, if you wanted to do zip code, you could. Okay. Okay. And then, what about like area code? well that that's the zip code are you talking like phone number yeah work phone so then what you could do is go into that third one or the second one if you don't need zip code you just need area code there's in that drop-down there's a one called all phone oh got it all phone yep and then just go ahead yep then you can put your area code in I had to put it in parentheses nope okay nine to zero all right and then nothing under keywords I shouldn't put anything under keywords nope you don't need anything under there it only pulls up one name I know I have more than that so in the title field before the word civil designer uh-huh put a percent sign Okay. Is there a space between them or not? Nope. Oh, we're just showing the one. I'm going to try. We should have more than that. I've I've been doing this 20 years. I'm going to check 414. It doesn't show any. I thought it had to do like civil plus designer or something like that. Yeah, for some reason it's not showing it. Is the civil designer the actual, like, title? Or is it separate things that you're looking for? the title huh I think civil I got C-I-V-I-L I thought it was civil yeah it could be civil that's funny it should show more than that. I mean, would it also search in resumes if I did that civil design? So you would have to do that in the keyword section if you wanted to search the resumes. Yeah, I definitely want to check resumes. Okay. So then you could do civil parts design. So is it, Are you searching for just a civil designer title or civil, then you would put in quotes, civil designer? Okay, so put in quotes like those two hashtags to the upper paragraph. Yeah, like the two quotes. It would just be civil designer. Okay, search. I'll just try that once and see how that works. Gosh, it doesn't show it. That's really weird. Oh, last name. It switched. I'll go back to all phone. Yeah, it doesn't show. So I got percentage, percentage, civil designer, percentage, civilist all together. There's a space and it says designer. And I got in parentheses, civil designer. I'm going to search. So the four one four. Are you looking for just the title civil designer? yeah I mean ideally I mean there's okay so get rid of all the other stuff in the search except for the all phone and just leave the keyword and the also so under the search field to do that? Yes. Get rid of the title one. We don't need anything in title. We don't need zip code. All we need is all phone and then what we have, that civil designer in quotes in the keyword section. Okay. So I'll put civil designer and then I'm sorry you said something else to put in there? yeah just whatever nope the civil designer and quotes yep with the all phone and 414 area code gosh that doesn't show anything that's crazy well even without getting the even just getting rid of the all phone I did in your database just civil designer in the keywords there's only four people that have that title in their resumes okay if you got rid of the all yeah oh really yep yeah i got one two three four yeah okay um um all righty and then uh oh so i'll So anything, what if I had just civil? I wonder what that does. And it shows like 1400. And I did just designer and it was like 812. But there's not, looks like that civil designer is very niche title. Okay. Okay, I'll try civil engineer. That's weird. But I had a lot more than that over the years. So I did civil engineer and I got 157. Okay, so that's basically what you, so when you get the civil, like, okay, I got civil, I got civil engineer. 157 so if I want to add them to a roll-up list or create one I can click on all results right yep check them all and then do I go to roll up then next so in the search results there will be an options menu where it'll say roll up names Where's that at? I just have roll-ups on top. So you do select all results, and then there's an options menu in the top right of the search results. Kind of looks like a cheeseburger, the three lines. Okay. Yep. Options. And then roll-up name? Yep. Okay. when I go to the three line and I go to which is options and then I just go to go up alright and then I can just and then I go to there and I just either add a row of this or click on one right yep okay so just say click add roll up on the screen right yep yeah that's if you want to add a new roll up list okay oh that's right civil engineer i'll try that yes So, it's in Wisconsin. And then if I wanna share it, I just click all users, yes. Okay, okay. And that's, then if I close this out, I should, there it is, Civil Engineer 157. Okay, all righty, yep, just wanted to just go rehash on that. So thank you. I appreciate it. Yep. No problem. You have a great day. Yeah. Thank you. Enjoy your weekend. You too.",
