    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Nanette Foster. I've been working with you guys, oh, I don't know, 13 or 14 years now and previous to that at my old firm. I wanted to reach out because I'm hearing some rumors about PCR that I'm concerned about, And that is about the financial stability of the organization. Obviously, everything's in the cloud, and I'd like to discuss why I'm hearing these rumors and if there's any truth to them. Oh, nothing that I know of that anything that's alarming. We're still fully functioning, operating. I'm not sure. So let me see here. We did have a few changes in our administrative staff, if maybe that's kind of where that originated from. I'm not sure. I have now heard it multiple times, including through a large network of recruiters that I'm a member of. So I, you know, I am concerned about that because I finally decided a few years ago to trust PCR in the cloud and everything. So all of my contracts are loaded in, you know, I mean, over a decade of notes and things such as that. So, you know, I'm just trying, I mean, I realize PCR is, you know, certainly not Crelate or Luxo. I mean, it's more of a digital filing system. But, you know, just wanting to make sure that the health of the company is good. Yeah, we're in good shape. Sometimes people want to maybe get a request to backup of their database if, you know, if that makes you feel a little safer or, you know, just to ease any concerns. We can give you a full data return of your database for $175, and you would get a file that contains everything stored in your database up to this point. So you have that backed up, and you can store it kind of off the cloud in your own hard drive or something, if that would help at all. Okay. So, I mean, do you have any idea why these rumors are out? Yeah, my best guess is that we've had some changes in the administrative department where people high up in the company have switched around and we brought in a couple of different people. So that might be I'm guessing that's probably where the rumor originated from. Maybe that instability just meaning that we've changed people and the higher ups. But everything now. Yeah. With the new people, they're great. Everything is working as intended. So that's my best guess on where that originated from. Okay. Is PCR privately held then? Yes. Yeah. And is the owner remained the same or is it new ownership? There is, let's see, I think there were four owners and then currently, I think two of them have been replaced with more of like a administrative manager. So two original owners still remain. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Just reach out if you ever want one of those database backups from us, and we will send that your way. Yeah, appreciate it. Thank you. All right. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye-bye.",
