    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Sonia Ippoliti calling from Princeton Legal Search Group. Haven't spoken to you guys in a while. Hope you've been doing well. Yep, doing good. How are you? I'm doing well. I have a couple of questions for you. Setting up a new user with PCR integration with Gmail integration with RingCentral. haven't done it in a while and just a couple things I'm a little shaky on wanted to confirm with you yeah so for the first thing I think this one will start with the easiest how do I make the name tab the default when he opens PCR right now I'm going to company yes so if you go to the little gear icon the top right hand corner yeah there's the user preferences yes and then there's the navigation configuration yeah and then open PCR action is to do hold sub navigation for no please where is it I know it's like what I think I figured it's an easy fix but I just didn't know where it was buried yeah I always forget where this one is ah all right click my PCR up at the top so I exit out of that menu. Yep. And then go into the options list for the MyPCR, like the stats down at the bottom right. Go to the customize option. Hold on. Am I in the configuration? Configure MyPCR? Or no? I'm under standard stats, like I'm down there. Yeah, so you'll go, there's like that options menu for it. Like above where it says like the standard stats? Am I going to the cog wheel, the little customize? Yes. Okay. And you'll see that there's that dashboard. Yeah. And so where it says startup screen. Oh, there it is. Company. And I want name. Name search. Great. Yep. All right. So where was that? That was in my PCR and then in the little, got it. The little cog wheel. Okay. Let me just jot that down because I have another user to set up to. MyPCR. Is there like an actual technical word for that? Some symbol? I would call it the cogwheel. I call it the gear icon. The gear. There you go. That's probably better than cogwheel. Okay. That's great. Thank you. um the the other question i have is so i enabled the um gmail integration um i just want to confirm the two-step verification is required right to leave on the gmail account so that's what it's the documentation says but there was at one point somebody told me otherwise i just want to make sure because it's been a while that that still holds true yes because gmail doesn't uh allow Gmail and Office 365 really don't allow simple verification anymore. Yeah. So that two-step verification is needed. Okay, great. The other piece is I know we're supposed to turn on the IMAP settings in Gmail, and that is no longer specifically there as it's shown on your documentation. so um like the toggle to turn it on is not there anymore um oh like in gmail itself yes yes yeah take a look yes i'm always the one finding these things you know yeah that i'm not are you talking about like in the admin side no no so like when the person needs to go into their gmail settings to turn on the imap um into this forwarding so they go into their settings forwarding and pop imap they have to enable IMAP. So you used to have to enable IMAP and it was a toggle. It was disabled or enabled. That is no longer there under IMAP access. Oh, yeah. So I'm pretty sure for Gmail, that's just automatically turned on now. Yeah. And I think you're right because I think most of my integration is working fine, except for one thing. I'll have to fill in my questions. But again, I just wanted to make sure that I'm not missing something. Yeah, it's automatically enabled for Gmail now. Okay, great. So you don't have to manually enable it like you used to have to do. Yep. Okay. That is great. Then let's see. So I enabled the integration and I sent a couple of test emails that are not tracking to the record. I gave it a good amount of time. I think it's been more than an hour just because I know there's a delay. Yeah, so let me do – once you have the IMAP set up in PCR mail for a user, it takes – we always tell people it can take up to 24 hours to do its first initial thing. I see so if you just set it up today check back tomorrow okay and if I set it up today and sent some test emails it will catch up so I don't have to like test it again tomorrow correct okay alright so I will I will save that for testing tomorrow and my final question is I also configured the ring central integration. And I thought I'd followed the instructions online, but when I tested a call from a quote-unquote, you know, a number that's in the system coming in to our new employee, it's not giving me the pop-up, the PCR pop-up showing who that contact is in the system. Who is the user? So the user is GK. It starts with a C. The name is GKUKA. Yes. Because you do have to allow notifications. So I do have notifications. So when the call came in, my RingCentral window popped up. The Google notifications popped up, but the RingCentral did not pop up. like just the ring central notification didn't pop up yeah but the pcr one did no i'm sorry because they're two separate notifications yes yes yes yes the the the p sorry the pcr did not pop up the ring central popped up i was able to answer the call The Chrome, like the Google notification popped up, but the PCR did not pop up. What do you mean by the Chrome? So here, I'm going to test it right now so I can tell you because I'm using a different – hold on one second. I'll tell you exactly what it is. I apologize that I'm mincing my words here. um seven two eight nine four all right oh google chrome ring central for google incoming call from sonya ipoliti and then it goes away i haven't i didn't do anything with it then it goes away um my ring central is still up and ringing so I can answer the call but the PCR pop-up never popped up with the contact. Let me take a look. And what's weird is I didn't understand so I was following the instructions for the notification, and it says here to disable the toggle for, you know, within RingCentral, to disable the toggle for launch an external app or website for incoming calls. I thought we were supposed to have that enabled. No. Yeah, because the notifications now come from the browser, not a separate app. Okay, because it used to, if I remember correctly, some time ago it used to be you did need to have that toggled on and there were a whole bunch of settings you had to put in a link. But anyway, it is off. It is toggled off, but it's still not coming up. It's toggled off in RingCentral, but the PCR pop-up is still not coming up. Are you getting the pop-up for capture? on your computer, like if you capture a record? I let me go to LinkedIn. One sec. LinkedIn. Hold on, I have to sign in with my account here. Let me just, bear with me for just a second. What number did you call from? I called from a phone number that's attached to a record in PCR. So I input my personal cell, I attached it to a test record in PCR, so I can test these things. Gotcha. Oh, yeah, I'm seeing the call activities there. I'm trying to log into LinkedIn on his account, and I just have to put in a code. Just one second. Almost there. Almost there. There it is. Okay. LinkedIn verification. 439-022. 439-022. Okay. I just want to get LinkedIn up here so I can test and check on the PCR capture extension. So I'm logged into PCR capture, the extension. And you know what? I am on LinkedIn and it's not popping up. Like it's not on the little side of the Chrome bar. Is that what you meant? Yeah, you might need to... Let's hop on a quick screen share here. There's a few places we might have to turn these on. Okay. Let me start up the meeting here. What's a good email for me to send this to? Yeah. I'm going to have you send it to GKUKA at princetonlegal.com. I'm just going to do this on his system. One more time for me for the email? Sure. GKUKA at princetonlegal.com. All right, I just sent that on over to you. All right. Hasn't popped in yet. There we go. Okay. Okay. It's opening up RingCentral. Please wait for the host to let me in. The host has a due to the meeting. Okay. I am going to continue without audio since we're on the phone. Yep. Okay, great. All right, so here we are. I'm going to do a screen share. I'll do my entire screen so you can see everything. And here we are. Let me minimize RingCentral. go to that little search bar down at the very bottom of the screen yeah search the web search that and then just start typing in settings oh we're doing a setting on the system itself yep going to settings here yep Okay. And then it should be system over on the left. And then go to notifications. Yep. and go ahead and scroll down. Go into where it says Google Chrome. Can I turn these off? No, we'll want these on. Oh, because that's just so annoying for that, because there's no purpose to it. But okay, if it needs to be on. yes because that's where the notifications come from is the browser got it okay and then go ahead and scroll is that all that it has in there or can you scroll down at all so that looks good Thank you. All right, go ahead and exit out of there for me. Okay. You can just exit out of the settings. Just entirely, got it. And up at the top, go ahead and go to your PC recruiter page real quick. and then click the little notification over on the right sorry notification oh got it okay so that's just the credentials Next to the WW2, click the notifications are turned on. Yeah, I did all it. Yeah, this is looking familiar. I think I did all of this. Yeah, go to where it says site settings for me. Yeah. Go ahead and hit that. Okay. Site settings. go ahead and hit delete data yep and then reset permissions yep then reset go Go back to your PC Recruiter page. It'll have you reload. Then go ahead and hit that click here to turn on notifications. Then hit allow. let's give it another try there. Another try. Just like that? Yep. Okay. One sec. Let me get back to my sound here. Six, seven, seven, two, eight. Oh, I think I missed dialed, of course. again six oh nine seven two eight okay yes you see what's happening i get the google chrome i'm going to ignore and i get ring central but i don't get yeah go ahead and hit ignore there it is So you have to hit ignore to get the PCR notification? Well, anytime it puts two notifications up at the same time, it can only display one at a time. So we can prioritize the... We can try and prioritize the PCRecruiter one, but that's just how Google notifications work. Got it. Okay. Yeah, because it used to be it came, yeah, it didn't come through Google before, so it was sort of like a standalone pop-up that would pop up. Okay, so I have to let my team know that if they have the SAT on, they just have to ignore the first notification if it's just Google, and then they'll see the PCR icon notification after that. Yep. Okay. All right. And then I guess the final question I have for you is there's just a weird delay. So I just want to show you. So if I go to a record and I want to make a call from this, wait, where's the number? Oh, here it is. And I wanna make a call from here. There just appears to me to be a significant delay. I'm just trying to figure out if this is, I don't remember this being the case. I'm just gonna make a phone call from the record here using the, so this opens, and then you kinda have to wait, And then that opens and this opens and then it starts to ring. So it's a little bit slower than what I remember. Does that look okay for you? Yeah, that's about right because it has to push over the information to a separate program. I'm so used to like instant gratification with everything. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That's great. So really the only thing outstanding is the tracking of the emails. And the fact that the tracking of the phone calls was like the inbound phone calls did track relatively quickly. And the inbound emails have not yet tracked. So you still think those might proliferate by tomorrow? Yes. Yes. Okay. All right. So I will just keep a look on that for tomorrow. Yep. Yeah. We always tell people just give it overnight. Got it. Okay. Okay. All right. Great. Well, you answered all my questions, Tyler. I really appreciate it. More than happy to help. Yeah. Great. So I think I'll hopefully I'll be in good shape for the other person I have to set up. But I know who to call if I'm not. So thanks again for your help. All righty. All right. Have a great day. Thanks so much. You too. Okay. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
