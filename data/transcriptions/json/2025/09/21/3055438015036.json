    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by your email address. I watched him leave. He didn't look packed up or anything. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good morning. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. Good morning. How are you? I'm well. John, how are you? Good. All right. All right. So, yeah, thanks for joining me. I wanted to talk with you a little bit about PC Recruiter and kind of see what you've learned, what questions you have initially, or did you have any initial questions before we get started, kind of outline the process? yeah I mean I I did a little run-through with with our our our technology team and they showed me the system it seems pretty intuitive I've used many a test systems in the past so I'm kind of used to how the databases work and so forth so they're all they'll have their their their quirks and they're the way they work the different things so it's just something I would have to dive into to learn but you know how customizable is it I guess it is very customizable so since you've had experience with these you kind of know the basics of how they work and how they look and everything like that um it's very configurable so what fields show where you can add in custom templates custom sequences email templates and stuff like that and the The nice thing about dimensional search is they pre-populate the database with a lot of customizations that are based around their training. So we have a specific template that is more than what a standard PC recruiter customer would get that would kind of give you a lot of stuff that they have used over the years and kind of developed. So they give you a custom template, and then you can change it on your own. And the training that we give you trains you how to do that if you want to tweak it or you think it would look better this way or that way or anything like that. Okay. Okay. And it integrates fully with all their systems. I know that. Does it integrate with LinkedIn as well if I decide to do that in the future? Yeah. Well, what it'll do with LinkedIn, our capture app will allow you to pull people in from LinkedIn. So you can pull a record right in with one click. It'll then create a record, import their photo, import a copy that is searchable of their summary. So you can do that. There's also a way to share jobs on LinkedIn that you can have people route back to your website to apply. So that'll work as well. So there's a couple different ways you can work with that. And then, of course, it'll integrate with HireEasy, ZoomInfo, RingCentral, all of those there too. Okay. I mean, is there anything that you think I need to know from my standpoint? Not really. Just what I'm going to share with you just kind of about the setup and everything like that. They give a great demo and they really do a good job of kind of giving an overview of it. And then the added benefit is that when you get set up on PC Recruiter, you have 10 hours of training with our trainers here. And then you also have full training with Dimensional Search. So our trainer would be a person that would get just started. They give you two to three sessions before you even go to your Dimensional Search training. And are you in the October class? Yeah, I'm in the October class. Yeah, so what they'll do, that gives us a good month to get everything in, but they will go through and you'll have your PC recruiter trainer, you'll work with the same person each time, and they'll give you two to three sessions before that point. They'll get you up and running in the system, show you how to create it, how to customize it, how to add users, how to do a lot of the configuration and the setup and everything like that. then dimensional search will pick up and they'll train you more on the recruiting side how to utilize pc recruiter in their version tips and tricks and then they'll kind of hand you back over to our trainer for a couple more sessions so they kind of balance each other and you essentially have two companies working with you to get your train on the system so like i said 10 hours training included and that uh the pricing i'm sure they told you 750 setup that's just a one-timer that includes setup and creation of the database, assistance hooking up any of the integrations you want to use, setting up like the capture piece, hooking it into your website, all of that. And then you're also going to be having those 10 hours. So you get the 10 hours training included in that. And then $50 per user per month. I would assume most people are just one user. Is it just you for now? For now, it's just me. Yeah, that price was surprising at the cost of per user, which is great. I might expand users for this tool, which would be great at $50,000. Yeah, they make it really very easy to do that. And when you add a user, it doesn't reset the contract. It doesn't change anything. You can just add a user, drop a user with a quick email to me. It's very easy to do. So it's pretty flexible on that front as well. Right. So remind me, because I know some things go right through them and some things are separate. Everything is paid for separately through PCR, not through dimensional, correct? Yeah, this is separate through us. So you work directly with us. So what we'll do today, I'll collect your company name and street address, and then I'll email you the paperwork. You can review that, take a look, sign that, and then once you sign it, then my accounting team will send over an invoice for the setup in first month. And then what happens as soon as that's paid will get you in queue to have your database created. So you'll have the brand new database. You will have the template that they give you. So that is kind of created in a couple of days after that. And then they set up recurring so it just gets charged to your credit card each month for the 50. Okay, perfect. So definitely send all that stuff over. I'll get over to you as soon as possible. I'm having a little issue with Microsoft and the website and the setup of my email. So I'm hoping to get that resolved today or tomorrow. I'm still waiting for them to get back to me. I should hopefully have all that set up shortly. But as soon as that's set up, we can move forward with that. I know they need about 30 days before my training starts to get – is that correct? 30 days before my training starts is probably the best time for them. Yeah, that way that they have some time that they can get just set up on two to three sessions. And I think it's October 8th, I think, is what runs on my mind, or 6th? The six or the eight. Yeah, I can't remember exactly. It's one of those. But yeah, I think it's the six because they usually start on a Monday. But yeah, that'll give you the whole month of September to get a few sessions on under your belt, get everything down. So I can email the paperwork as soon as you're ready, let you review that. And then once you sign and get paid, it takes a couple of days to get the database set up, takes a couple of days to get a trainer assigned. But we can get moving on that anytime you'd like. yeah yeah send me the information hopefully the next day or two once once this issues result i have a domain issue like i bought a domain it should be fine and i'm setting up my email i'm trying to consolidate everything under one email so i'm using a different business email that i set up i have my personal i'm just trying to get my business email set up so i can get everything flowed it through there and it just makes it easier to track i've got like three emails in front of me. It's just going to be the same. But hopefully in a day or two, that'll all be resolved. I'll sign it and we'll get this thing started. For sure. And I have the email, yourfirst.last at jbsconsulting.net. Is that going to be the best one? No, that one's going to be going away. Let's use John Aiello 747 at Gmail. No dots or anything, just first name, last name, 747 at Gmail. That's my personal for now. In the future, it should be jiello at jbsrecruiting.com. That's going to be the new company name. I'm just laying it out. I'm having an issue with Microsoft. As far as we'll set it up under the Gmail for now, but as far as changing the main email user, that shouldn't be a problem, right? Yeah, I'll email it to your Gmail right now, and then we can just put the new email address once it's ready into our system here and use that from that point forward. So that's no problem there. Okay, and that will only happen if this email is not set up in the next two or three days, because I want to sign up and get this started within two or three days at the worst. So if I still have an issue after two or three days, I'll use my personal email instead of the business email. Okay, perfect. So what I'll do, I'll send it to the Gmail for now, and then the company name is going to be JBS Recruiting? Yes. Okay, and what is the street address associated with you? It's 26 Randolph Street, R-A-N-D-O-L-P-H, and that's Lincoln Park, New Jersey 07035. Perfect. And what is a good number for you? Just so I can update you in our system or phone number? For now, I'll use myself, 484-620-9155. 9155. That's mobile. Okay. So, yeah. So, what I'll do, I will go ahead and put the paperwork over to you. It's going to come over in a DocuSign style format. It's actually called PandaDoc, just a different name brand of DocuSign. take a look at that there's signature places on there once you sign it it'll come back to me I'll countersign it then I'll put a ticket into my team to have the invoice sent and then once that invoice is paid a day or two you'll have your link set up and ready to go and then we can get a trainer assigned then have an initial intro call and then that trainer and you and I will kind of work with you to get the first several sessions on the schedule and get everything going okay great and then I guess once I set it up I should just let dimensional know so they I guess I'll add them to have access so they can start importing the information they need to import yeah they will I think they'll ask you for your link and your username password to populate data do some setup work and stuff like that so you'll share with them once it's created and set up perfect perfect okay yeah please send it over Jim I will take a look at it like that hopefully a day or two this was taken for way too long from from a Microsoft standpoint, but at worst two days, we'll sign in and we go to shoot the email. Cool. We will be quicker than Microsoft. I'll give that over to you this afternoon. Okay, great. Great. Thank you so much for your time today. Very well. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you, Jim. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
