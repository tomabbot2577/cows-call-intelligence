    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Maggie Cunningham at Bank Search. I can't get my emails to go through, and I also – it's weird. Let me go over there. I just got off another call. It says it won't send it. Let me try to send one, and I'll tell you what it says. How's that? Yeah, that works. It's not there anymore. But it didn't send it. Maybe it did send it. That'd be my luck. Yeah, let me take a look at your settings here. Okay. Okay. Hmm. It won't open an email. Which email address were you sending it with? I'm sorry, which one was I sending it with? Yeah, the Maggie at BlancheSearch.com. All right, so that one's testing properly. You know, I'm trying to like click to send an email, and it won't even do that. Like the box isn't popping up? Right. Can you try logging out and back in? I was just going to say, should I log out and back in? Okay, yeah, I can do that. Maybe it'll work. I changed, I didn't actually change the internet providers, but I went from residential to business, so I have a new Wi-Fi thing. Oh, boy. It's not been a good computer week. And who are you trying to send the email to? Bren Bemis B-E-M-I-S I see the issue already Do you? Good. What is it? So in their email address that you have on the record there's a special character at the end of the .com that you need to get rid of Okay But when I was trying to do Let me save that Okay. Let's see if it will let me send one to her. Okay. I'll try that. Let me send it somewhere else. Let me send one to somebody where I can put in test. And he'll say, huh? Thanks. Yeah. Okay. That's working. It was me. Yeah. So, yeah, if there's that special character at the end, that's going to throw it off. Yeah, but it didn't say wrong email address. It just said something, alias. Yep. So that's just like a generic error. because what happens is we're trying to make the connection, and it's saying, no, you can't make the connection. Okay. The other thing on the email setup, I wanted to change my team signature. Yep. And that's going to work now before I would click on it and it wouldn't do anything. Yeah, so to change your signature in PC Recruiter, you go to System. Yeah, I think I'm there. Yep, email setup and then email signature. Okay. I got it. See, before I logged down, I needed to log out and log back in. It would not even let me. It wasn't letting you open that box? Yes, that's correct. Gotcha. Yeah, it looks like you just needed a fresh session there. Okay. Okay, well, thank you very much. Yep, not a problem. You have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
