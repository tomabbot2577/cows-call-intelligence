    "text": " Hello. Oh, hi, Robin. I think it's already working, but when I clicked on the phone icon before it routed me to the RingCentral app, there's still a pop-up window there. is that yeah the ad yeah the ad activity window that pops up as it's passing it over in case you want to write an activity for the call that you make with a specific activity type and maybe do a follow-up so if you don't want to do that you would just exit it but it does pop that up oh okay see well um i think it's working now okay yeah i think you just had the wrong app They had the wrong app selected. It just had an older app. It's like an older version. They used to do it where it was like your phone and your meetings were two separate apps. And then later they came up with this all-in-one app, which is what pretty much everybody has. But like when you first create and go into the settings, it defaults to that older app. So that's probably what confused you. It was just never switched over. Like we just used. Yeah, so it was an issue with selecting the right settings through the PCR tool, not the RingCentral app. Yeah, it was in PCR here. I can send you a screenshot. Let me see here. Actually, I have it in the ticket. Hold on one second. Let me just grab this screenshot. Okay, what's a good email for you? It's going to be Hannah, so H-A-N-N-A-H at N-P-W, so that's November Papa Whiskey LegalRecruiting.com. I'm going to send you this email just so you can see a screenshot. And the issue probably is when you first go in that drop-down, that's kind of why you don't see this. It's not easy to tell all the options in there, but it defaults to their old ones. I'm going to actually ask the developers to change that, that when you're first setting. so what was happening when you get that email your setting had ring central desktop phone selected and it needed to have ring central app which is they're all in one okay got it okay yeah that's the setting that I switched for you awesome so yeah I was able to receive your email here I'll just forward this to Donna as well because she's my admin well I think we're all set here. It's already working. Thank you so much, Robin, for taking the time to help me out today. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
