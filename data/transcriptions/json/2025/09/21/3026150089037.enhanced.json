    "text": " dial it at any time to speak with Jeff press 1 to speak with sir yeah I just got disconnected from you yeah hold on a sec There you are. You back? Yes, here I am. Okay. Yeah, what I was saying was the, I saw that come through on the sign in that you've, that PCR has added these, some of these AI features. The part of it that's the most intriguing to me would be, you know, improved search capabilities as it pertains to candidates. I played with the AI a little bit, but I couldn't figure out how the AI works from a search perspective in regard to candidates. And so I was curious about that, which I'm not where you can show me anything right now. I'm not in front of my screen or anything. But that was intriguing to me. And then, of course, I got the impression that there was going to eventually be an increase in the rates if you chose to use those tools. And I was just curious what the cost is going to be for those tools once you get past kind of the beta side, I guess. Well, for you, it would just be $5 per user per month because you're already on the premium. so that would upgrade it to premium plus, just an additional $5, no setup. We'll just kind of increase it a little bit if you wanted to keep it. And it includes all four of the functions there. The search right now, if you're looking to search resumes, the AI search is not going to be very good at that. It's just not really good at that. So the AI search, candidly, is my least favorite part of the AI features because it just doesn't usually get it right. I don't like searching like that. I like Boolean. I like very concrete black and white sales and marketing. I just look for both. I don't want to do like show me people who I haven't – that doesn't appeal to me. But it just doesn't quite hit like it should to me. And from what I've heard from people, the search just doesn't really – like it will return – like you can use it for show me people in Ohio or show me interviews with no candidates or rather jobs with no interviews, stuff like that. So you can find just kind of some broad searches throughout the database, but one thing you can't do anything with the data. So you get the results, but you can't email to them. You can't save them to a roll-up list. You can just go to each one individually and look at them. So it's still being worked on, so it's not really the best, in my opinion, right now. We're also working on the ability to setting up a little auto match so you can go ahead and when you go to a job, there's going to be a button on the job screen that will give you the ability to click that button and it'll pull forth the 15 closest matches through your database searching through some candidates. That'll search resumes, notes, and stuff like that. But that's not quite out yet. That's going to be out in a couple of weeks. Yeah. Yeah, I wish, yeah, PCR is so far behind everybody else. It's, as we've had that discussion before, you and I have. I continue to be patient. We're working on it. yeah I get it I get it but the way technology moves and how fast it's going nowadays I don't know yeah the only thing that keeps me from really even getting serious about looking for something different is the hassle of changing if you find it so that's what keeps me hanging on but I so much we've been through this before so I don't want to You know, I don't want to bore you to nauseam, but everything is so complex. Sequencing is complex, you know. We got a little instruction, a little training. I paid for some stuff, but at the end of the day, sequencing is a raw pain in the neck. Trying to set it all up, trying to make it work. you know I'm paying for it but I'm not really quite honestly I'm not really using it so anyway and that's probably the true same problem with anything you do you know but we're all just we're all just running and gunning right now I know that you know you're in the business you know the business is crazy right now finding good people is the biggest challenge and then connecting with those individuals. So anyway, well, I was just curious. It doesn't sound like there's much to get too excited about in regard to the candidate portion of AI just yet. I'd give it a little time, yeah. Yeah, and I figured you'd bring clarity to me, as you always so kindly do. Sure. So, you know, I'll play with the other stuff that is there. I don't even know what the other three are, honestly off the top of my head the other three functions of it but when I saw it come through I was like yeah because I have the hardest time searching PCR I've tried different things and bullying and all kinds of various different searches that's not an easy database to work with anyway I there are no reason for you to have to listen to that I appreciate you though sir very much for sure no problem yeah I think keep an eye on it in about a month once they release the auto match I think they're trying to also improve that searching and the the boolean searching it I think it works great are you on Lucene do you get the score up top when you do the search yeah yeah it you know we use it but and it's just I don't know it just doesn't to me it doesn't really do such a good job maybe I don't have a bunch of good candidates in there I I don't know. I'll probably have 30,000 people in there, which I've deleted hundreds over the years, just so it doesn't get overloaded. But because, you know, stuff gets old. It's the craziest thing. You know, databases used to be a big deal 15 years ago. And nowadays, almost every search is from scratch. You know, I start with my database, doesn't really pull the details. So, you know, LinkedIn, Zoom info, and other methods that we use are where we end up turning to. So, anyway, I appreciate you, sir. I have one other question. I'll let you go. When are they planning on having the whole new system that they keep promising? When is that supposed to truly, seriously come to fruition? Oh, it's out. PCRM? Yeah, it is out and available. it's not a replacement for nine it's a CRM product that works kind of side by side with nine so they kind of went in a little bit different direction there so what's it supposed to do what it does it's going to give you a different interface so it's a more modern interface it adds a deals pipeline so you could put in like a deals pipeline where you essentially take companies and move them through the process there's a simpler sequencing tool in there called simple sequencing, which a lot of people like because people were saying the sequencing is so hard to set up and utilize. They added a simple sequencing piece in there as well. So that's been added in. Well, I have not heard of the PCRM. So that's news to me. So that's going to be their modern version of what they were going to come out with. that that's the one. Yeah, what it was instead of replacing 9 with a UI upgrade, they just went to a whole new separate product that you could use instead of 9 or in addition to 9 because it's not a conversion. You don't convert your 9 into PCRM. You just can use both. So you could keep on 9 or you could add the PCRM link to access the exact same data and database but in PCRM. So it gives you another option there. If you want, maybe we could set up a time to look at a demo sometime in the next couple of weeks. Yeah, I would like to do that. I'd like to at least see what you've got cooking there. The company, maybe I just don't pay attention, but it doesn't seem to me like the company does a very good job in keeping people updated in regard to what they're up to. Yeah, they don't. They don't even keep us always updated on what they're up to. but yeah, that's kind of, kind of, they, they haven't done a formal release. So that's why you haven't seen anything. It's just been kind of people hearing about it and word of mouth and stuff like that. So just kind of, that's how they've been doing it. But I could get something maybe early. I'm out next week, but maybe you want to get something set up the first week of August. Take a look. Yeah. If you want to reach back out to me, I'm not, I'm not in front of my calendar right now, So if you want to reach back out to me, we can get something set up for the week after next. I'll call back. Take a look at it. Early that week at the 4th, I'll check you and get something set up for later. Yeah, that's great. I'd at least like to see what you guys are doing at this point. So what kind of additional cost is that going to be? That is only $10 more per user per month. It includes the AI piece and $3.50 to set it up. So $3.50 set up includes four hours training on it, and then it also includes the AI. It's just $10 more per user per month. Okay. All right, sir. Well, then what about, well, you know, I'm already paying more for sequencing on the current scenario. So I don't know how much more I'm paying, but for these few additional things we've added, there's been, I think I'm paying like $50 a user more. I think you're, let's see what I've got out there. you are paying $100 a month per user. So you'd be like $110. Earned user. Yeah. Wow. $110 with the PCRM and everything we have. So it wouldn't change my pricing very much then? No. Okay. All right. Well, call me when you get back. I guess you're on vacation. So if that's the case, have a nice trip. Will do. and give me a shout when you get back in the office. We'll coordinate something. I'd at least like to look at it, sir. Sure, I'll do it. All right, appreciate you. Thanks for your follow-up, Jim. Thanks, sir. You take care. Take care, buddy. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
