    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, this is Jim. Hello, this is Jim. hey how are you i am doing all right uh still recovering a bit from this covid spell but happy to be with you and thank you again for being so flexible uh and accommodating i know you've got i think a vacation coming up next week so um i appreciate you making the time no problem no problem where are you headed i'm going to the outer banks in north carolina that's where we'll be oh my gosh how fun i've never been well no i don't think that's north carolina in general but i've heard of the outer banks so that's cool it's cool i was there 10 years ago. So it's been a little while. Oh my gosh. Well, that will be fun. For sure. Did you get the COVID where it's the really, really sore throat, the one they were talking about? It's so interesting because I wasn't originally going to test because I didn't have the sore throat. And I heard from so many people that that's kind of what they've experienced with this new strain. And instead, what I had, and now, you know hindsight so it's 2020 right and you probably don't need my full medical history but I did go to the dentist the day before that I left because I had this like crazy out of nowhere like back of my jaw toothache and you know kind of went away and then when I was on vacation one morning I woke up and my like whole right side like my ear was just fully um it just felt like it was totally blocked or plugged like and that whole side of my face just felt really not normal. And so, but for me, it kind of went upward. So now I'm kind of dealing with like the fogginess and the just extreme, like, you know, it just, you don't feel like yourself. Right. So, I mean, I think I sound relatively okay, but you know, I definitely feel like something's kind of off still, but yeah, I guess it, you know, it has been picking up, which I, shame on me, I guess we're not paying attention to, you know, that being kind of on a surge, But, yeah, so. Yeah, I remember the pressure. I had COVID years ago, like in 2022 or something. I remember heading to Washington, D.C. for the holidays and going through the mountains of Pennsylvania. My head was so stuffed like that. And I've driven that way 100 times off to the East Coast. But that day, it was just, it hurt so bad I could barely even stand. My eyes were tearing because the pressure and the elevation changes were just hurting so bad. It was terrible. I bet. It was the worst. Yeah, no, that is horrible. I was nervous about getting on the plane because I thought, okay, this could go one of two ways. And thankfully, I was able to kind of sleep on the flight. I think I was just so exhausted from everything else. I got lucky with that. But, yeah, it's lingered longer than I would like it to. So I'm ready just to feel better. For sure. For sure. Well, glad you're on the mend. Glad you're on the mend. So I want to show you around PCRM a little bit. What have you heard about it? I'm excited. Have you seen it? Have you heard anything? Okay. You know, I want to say I might have seen one screenshot from, oh, my gosh, Dave Reith, I believe is his name. I don't know if you are familiar with Dave Reith. He has his or his, you know, business is a part of the Dimensional Search family. He might even be SRA now. But I think I saw one screenshot from him, but I really haven't. Other than that, I don't know much. So I'm a sponge excited to learn. Okay, excellent, excellent. So, yeah, so the CCRM, I'm not sure if you know, it was designed, it was started a couple of years ago. It was going to be a whole replacement interface for 9. But what happened is as they were adding more functionality, more CRM functionality, early this year it was decided that we were going to spin it off into a separate product almost, but one that shares the same database as PC Recruiter. So the nice part about that is that you can utilize both versions at once. And if you add a PCRM, you don't have to convert your data or move your data or anything like that. You can still log in under PCR9 or under PCRM. So you kind of would have both interfaces if you wish. The PCRM interface is going to have almost everything that you currently have in PCR9, but it's going to add a simpler sequencing piece, a sales funnel, and this whole new interface. So it's going to add a whole new way to look at PC Recruiter. So we're looking at the sign-in screen here. I'll show you around kind of the basics of what it looks like and some of the stuff that's in here that's not in 9. So as I go in, I'm going to go ahead and log myself in. And once I get in, you'll see this is my dashboard that pops up. But how we've set it up, everything's kind of down the left-hand side of the screen. So rather than putting the menu bar at the top and making it something that goes up and down and top and bottom, this is going to give you the ability to use a little bit more of your screen. You have a full screen here. You're going to be able to, if I look at names, let's say it's going to go into the name menu. It's going to show me the last bunch of names that I looked at. And if I click into any one of these records, it's going to load in from the right. So it's going to kind of go on top of the list there. And then you have a custom workspace. You can kind of design whatever you want in here. I've got a little version of the resume, some basic fields. Maybe I want my activities, and I can even kind of full screen it if I needed to. and then all of these other the buttons that you're used to at the top of the PC recruiter name record they are now tabs and you can actually very easily move them so if I wanted to make my resume tab go next to positions I could do that so it's easier to navigate the screen easier to configure and it's kind of a drag-and-drop so if I go into my workspace I can click the little edit and then I'm able to pick to own resumes activities candidate field list I could drag different things around as I go. So it gives me a lot more flexibility than the other version of different things I could do with it. And the thing I like about this version, if I go under details, details is going to be every field I have on that person all on the screen there and it gives you a quick search. So if I need their phone numbers I could just type in phone. That's going to immediately filter my search to only my fields that are called phone and that's going to show me all my phone numbers. Or I could do the same with email. So it gives me a nice easy way to navigate the system the keywords are nice too because you can actually tag so you see I have a couple of keywords tagged up here up next to the header of his screen I can tag up to three keywords right up at the top there which is kind of a cool piece there and it's also going to show his title company he's linked to location it's going to show how many interviews I think that shows only we hover over that I don't know what that shows let's see I think that's roll-ups. Roll-ups, that's what it is. Roll-ups and positions, yeah. So how many positions he linked to and how many roll-up lists he's on. So kind of gives you some different things. And then your action menu, still going to be these options up here, your map, your link to position, add to roll-up, all of that stuff. It's going to go up there. Add to roll-up, add node, add activity, and everything like that. What we've also kind of kept it is we've kept it the same throughout. So if I go to my names, I'm going to be able to look at my name menu. I have an edit in line now. I also have my quick actions right from there. I can email, call, SMS. I can add activities, add them to a roll-up, do some different things right from there. So I have some different things, a little bit more functionality, but then if I go to companies, it's going to look and work just the same. It's going to give me a list of companies, all the same terminology. If I go into the record, same customization, same edit, same workspace, same details. So it's easier to pick up and easier to learn as you go through. Same with the position. You'll be able to see all your position information there. Now, the position, we've kept the same pipeline. So if I kind of go into full screen here, I always full screen it for pipeline. But if I go into my pipeline, pipeline is going to look and work just the same. So that's going to be something familiar with what you're using now. A couple of other things that are the same, the analytics screen as well as the sequencing screen, those are identical to what you're currently using because when these features were built, we were already developing PCRM, so we already knew it was going to look like this, so we made it so it was going to look the same in both. So it kind of gives you some comfort, but a lot of new features there. You're also going to have a cooler way to add something different is adding records. So if I go to my add up here in the upper right hand, kind of where that little lightning bolt button is, I can drop a bunch of files in here or I can go, maybe I want to add a name and I can add that name and I can go through here and I can put Frank in there and then I'm like, oh, I want to put in this company. I can go down here. I can add a new company on the fly. I can go X, Y, Z, and I can go ahead and actually go back to Frank, and I can link him to that company that's a draft record. So I can kind of create multiple things at once. I could even upload an attachment, maybe make that part of his record, too. So I can upload some attachments, I can upload resumes, parse things, and I can add multiple records at once and have them connected to one another as I do. So that has been improved for ease of use. Still going to work with the capture, still going to work with the job board, all the integrations are going to be the same because it's the same back end database. Just this new interface gives you this new interface for a lot of the screens there. now I really like this is probably so minor but for me the first thing that really jumped out is exactly where you're hovering right now that name icon it's you know some people are just more visual learners I will say and with the amount of individuals we have in our database you know that's to me that's really nice I think that will just help my brain to be honest yeah and it lets you also that icon is going to be useful because it'll not only open the record but if you hover over it you can kind of page through the individual records you're looking at. So you can kind of page through by clicking the button. So that's kind of a nice function. And the roll-up lists, they have been updated, so they're going to look a little bit different. So you have your roll-up list here. You can see how many names, how many companies, how many positions. You have some actions right on here, so you can add a name to it, add a company to it. You can edit it, write in lines. You can change the name if you want, put a description in right from there. So it's a little easier to do that. One big difference, something that didn't make it over into PCRM is roll-up list stages. And you're with Dimensional Search, right? Yes, I am. And I think they pretty heavily train on roll-up list stages. I don't know, do you use those pretty heavily? I do, yes. And I think early on in our conversation, you mentioned something about sequencing. And I will say for me, I started in sequencing and I felt like it was a little bit disconnected, to your point, kind of how we were taught and what we were, you know, really advised on from the roll-up standpoint. So, for the past couple months, I have been working more through the roll-ups and, yes, kind of using those stages, but I do know how to use both, I should say. Yeah, well, what we've done here is the stages have been pulled out and they were not included in the PCRM but they changed up the sequencing a little bit and made it so that it kind of almost there's a simple sequencing piece that almost replaces the the stages so we show you what I mean so if I go into a specific roll-up list what I can do is I can build a simple sequence right on the fly so I can go here and I can build a sequence right here the fly I can say it's going to be an email automatic it's going to be a work email it's going to be this form letter then I add another step and maybe it's a call so I can kind of throw together a quick sequence here save all and activate it right right at once so under a minute you can create a much simpler than the old interface which is still here but this one's going to be a little bit easier to use further once you have a sequence running like I do on this simple sequence test one, I go to that roll-up list, kind of very similar to the roll-up list stages, you're going to have a sequence column that's showing there it's stage one or stage whatever in that sequence. So the sequences are the stages, so it's going to show you what stages they're at, but it gives you the ability of automated emails being sent out or maybe the stage was a call or an email or something like that. So there are stages, but they're not called roll-up list stages, they're actually stages in a sequence. So a little different way of thinking and I know that the team of dimensional search I think is kind of figuring out a different way to train on this Because people are starting to move over and utilize this like someone I demoed the other day There they wanted both and then there's a couple other people that are starting to get it like yourself They kind of heard about it wanted to get it. So they're starting to figure out Some different ways of working with the stages as a simple sequence here Okay, and then Also, another new feature is going to be the deals pipeline. So there's this deals pipeline. It's a pipeline been created in here entirely for companies. So you can take the companies and move them through a pipeline here so that maybe they're qualified, they're contacted, they need assessment, contracts sent, contracts signed, and what have you. So you can go through and you can kind of drag and drop your companies one to the next. And as you do, that's going to go ahead and move them. And that's going to kind of give you a little process here. There's going to be forecasting on here because if you go into the actual deal there, there's some things you can put, whether it's warm, hot, cold, cool. You can put your confidence level in there, projected close date, potential value. So you can add as much or as little info as you wish, and you can drag and drop these through this process, and you can report on kind of where things stand. It helps you keep better track of your sales in the system. And it's also going to give you the ability very soon to send out like a DocuSignable agreement that's going to be integrated with PC Recruiter. So the DocuSign is sent from PC Recruiter, assigned, and then pushed right back into the database. So that's going to give you a nice piece as well. That's probably going to be maybe a month or two. Interesting. And that will be, okay, so you're saying that's not there yet, but that will be in the next couple of months. Will that be an additional, like, because I know DocuSign, they have a, I'm assuming they charge, right? They're not like a free service. So does that, is that rolled into kind of what we pay monthly for PCR? Or would that, do you know if that would be like an additional add-on? I don't think it's going to be anything extra. To my knowledge, it's not any extra because they're working on having the ability to just include that in there. So I think we've worked on some integration with them. So I think it's included. Cool. Okay. Awesome. So that's going to be nice. Either way, I think that integration is very helpful, right? So I just, yeah, just serious, but that's awesome. Sure. So that's going to be very cool. So that deals pipeline, really, really nice. Nice and great interface there. and it's just a fresher interface. You'll see it's easier on the eyes, it's easier to pick up, it's easier to use. Some of the things too, like the schedule. That hasn't changed much yet. It may be in the future, but it's pretty much the same. And then, but like all your records are much more refreshed. So it's going to be more variously there. Yeah. And I do like the hamburger menu on the left hand side, I think. And just to your point of being able to kind of see more information within, you know, your single window, if you will. So, yeah, it definitely looks refreshed and more modernized. And so my background, I was at Amazon Web Services for almost seven years before I decided to leave and, you know, start this business. And over my time there, I have seen my fair share of terrible tools and pretty good tools. So for me, I have been fairly invested in trying to really figure out my tech stack and understand what is going to be the most seamless and, you know, best for my business. So, yeah, just even seeing this, I feel like there's a lot of really good potential here. So I'm excited. Yeah, so it's going to be nice. And to add it in, it is a little, it's like $10 more per user per month and a one-time setup of $3.50. And that 350 not only creates and generates the new link, so you'd get a different link to access the same database, but it also includes four hours of training on the new features, functions, and use of the system. So if you wanted to go that route, you could add it. I just send over a new agreement, and then we can get everything added very simply. Perfect. Yeah, I think that would be great. I would love to start that process. Very well, very well. What I can do, I can email that over, send you over the paperwork today. Let me just hop over into your record, make sure I've got your correct company name and address. It should be correct. Let's see. So I've got 2145 Shenandoah Court, Unit B. Yes, that is correct. However, company name, so that was just kind of, that's actually my, I think, C-suite name. if we can update that to DataCare, that would be awesome. So data and then care, all one word, but the C is capital. Perfect. Yep. And then separate word. You got it. Separate word, then talent solution. And those are, yeah, two separate words. Perfect. That's how I was going to write DataCare, just instinctively. So it made sense. Yes. Oh, I'm so glad. Awesome. Yeah. So what I'll do. Perfect. That would be awesome. the paperwork there, just one user, that's all good. And then, so you'll still have the nine, you'll just also have the PCRM. You can kind of bounce back and forth and maybe eventually you find you're only using them. It's really up to you. Awesome. I love it. I do have, if you don't mind, Jim, if I could ask you just one quick question in regards to duplicate, if you know anything about that or if there's any potential updates on kind of the system catching some of those things. I've just noticed, and again, it's because I'm new and I'm, you know, gathering information. I'll get somebody from LinkedIn or I'll get them from the HireEasy tool or, you know, wherever. And oftentimes I've found like, okay, then all of a sudden I end up with three people that are the same person, right? And it is somewhat of a manual process to kind of go through and mark that. So I'm just curious if that is anything in the new version or if that may be on the roadmap in the future. Well, they've improved the duplication. So what they did in that click to add when I was going in and adding a name, there's a check duplicates button in the lower right-hand corner at any time you can go through here. So if I went ahead and I added Jim Lombardo and I just put in that, I can hit check dupes. And it's going to check under your status. It's going to tell you has duplicates. So it's going to give you an easier way of doing it than getting it all done and creating. Just throw in a name. Then you can click right into there. You can see who they are. You can go through. You can pull the record information, update it, or you can discard that. Maybe that's not a do, but I can pop this. I can pull that information. So it's going to pull some information here. And then I can go through and kind of add it, merge it, update it, anything like that. So we've kind of worked on that a little bit better here. And then the capture is still going to work the same. And the capture will look for dupes as well by LinkedIn address or by name and phone number, email address too, I think. Perfect. Okay. That's awesome. Thank you. Very well. Well, I will go ahead and send everything over, and I'll touch base with you. Tomorrow morning I'll be in, and then I'm going to be on email off and on over the next week. Go ahead. Okay. If I happen to check in, I'll see you. But we can get you rolling as soon as I get everything back in. So what we'll do, we will send over the paperwork. You can DocuSign that. It's actually PandaDoc, just a different name brand of that. And then once I get that, they'll invoice you for the setup. As soon as that's paid, you will, within a day or two, we'll get the new link created and emailed out to you. amazing oh i'm excited okay well i will yes i'll be on the lookout for all of that um and get that over to you today um and if i don't speak with you before you take off um i do hope that you have you know safe travels there and a really fun time um just yeah hopefully disconnecting a little bit so sure yeah i appreciate it i appreciate it all right well i will get that over and uh then we'll talk to you soon. That sounds great. Thank you so much, Jim. Thank you. Take care. Bye now.",
