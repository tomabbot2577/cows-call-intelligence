    "text": " Hello? Hi, this is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hi Robin, how are you? I'm good. So I did change your users when you requested before. Awesome. Fortunately, here's what happened. We had like a bookkeeping consultant, they were going in and adjusting like for taxes and making sure all of that was applied because there's so many tax changes. and I think it got reverted back to two. What I can do for you is either skip the next invoice so you don't get, so your next invoice is going to go August 1st where we just skip that one and it makes up the difference. Okay. Or I could, I've already readjusted it to one year. I can let it go ahead and like create it now for August 1st, but with a credit or would you prefer just to skip it? If you've already had that done, Let's just skip it. Whatever is easiest for you. We don't mind at all. Okay. All right. So you will not get an invoice on August 1st. Okay. And then you'll get one for September 1st for one user. Got it. Is that okay? And then everything evens out? Yes. That's totally great. No worries at all. Yeah, because otherwise it will probably take longer to get a refund because I would go through somebody else to do it. And this way I'll just skip. Yeah. All right. All right, so I'm skipping it right now. I wanted to see what you want to do first. Okay, so I have skipped August 1st, and you will be September 1st for your next one. Okay, sounds great. All righty, thank you so much. Thanks so much. I appreciate you getting back. All righty, thank you. Bye. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye. Bye.",
