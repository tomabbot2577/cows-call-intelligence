    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey Robin, Mark Wysocki, MRN Bonita Springs. How are you today? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. I have a question for you because I've been doing this manually for a while. We changed the due date to be or the pay date for the auto pay to be the due date. I'm sorry, not the due date. Whatever the heck the 15 days, you know, we had set up the way we always had it um as far as when i was making it i don't know if you remember this conversation or not maybe not but we went to the vault to try and set up the auto pay and um i'm finding that it doesn't stick so what what happened when i log out yeah when i log out it takes me out of it again i was going to send you an email it's like yeah this is goofy so i thought maybe we just talk through it. Let me see what's going on here. Okay, let's see. So it looks like you have a card ending in 40, I'm sorry, 8436. Correct. Okay, your auto pay is not on. Do you want me to set that up for you? I, yeah, you can do it from there. I mean, I just went in and what happened was I went in and did it. I said auto pay invoices. Yes. And then pay on the due date. Okay. And not on the invoice date because the choices are due date and invoice date. Right. Yeah. Okay. So I can set it to due date. I wonder if there's like a save option that maybe was overlooked. There is. There's a button at the bottom. Once you, once you do that, you click save and it takes you to another screen that says the name on the card has to be the same as the name on the. it's a debit card. So it's management recruiters of Bonita Springs or management recruiters is the name on the card. Okay. And when I, when I click that, it'll say, okay. And then when you go out, save it, and then it takes you back to that screen again. So some, somehow or another, I'm not doing something right. Or, you know, maybe I can't use the debit card. I don't know. You should be able to, I don't think that, I mean, it does have a start stored card. So here's what I will do. I have it set right now that it's on for the due date. Okay. 436 I don't really see much details about that card right let me see can I I know I can't see the full number let me see what else I can't see about it store payment message so the name on the card management recruiters like exactly Yeah, it says management recruiters and then under it, it says Marche Wysocki. So it has me as the individual user for the account. There is only one individual in this company, as you know. Yeah. So, I mean, it says management recruiters as the name here. Right, right. And that's how that should be right. Okay. I mean, we set it up 15 days from invoice date. So that would be tomorrow to Saturday. And I went to go into it. I was like, well, you know, because I have another two things, one that goes automatic out of my checking account, one that I do manually, and then this one that I was doing manually that I thought we could automate it. Well, I have it on for now. Okay. So I'll check for Monday. What I can do, yeah, let me put a little reminder to myself. And I'll look just to make sure it went through on Monday. Okay. Or maybe on the weekend. Well, Tuesday because it'll be Monday. Monday's processing date, right? So then it would be Tuesday probably. But I just don't want to be. Okay. So it is due the 16th. It should process tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Well, then with any luck, you know, in the banking world, I've worked in banking for a long time. It may have changed. But in the banking world, Saturday is part of Monday or becomes Monday because it's not a bank day. But on the digital side of things, if I make a payment through QuickBooks, it posts the day. Whatever day I put it in, Saturday, Sunday, doesn't matter. so probably going to work that way but let's um you know if you could just maybe take a peek at it and if we need to do something different um that's fine if this doesn't work for some reason i'll just make a point of just the heck with vault and i'll just do it manually i mean yeah so yeah we'll just have to see if the card gets declined for some reason but if it let you save it i think it usually won't let you save it until whatever right right so it is saved so that's And it works. Yeah. Yeah. Because I've been doing it manually the last couple of months and I'm getting ready to go out of town. And I mean, for like a while, I got a week out in the beginning of September, two more weeks in the middle of September. And that would fall all over this next thing. So I'd rather get it squared up if I can. It would be better. OK. All right. I put a reminder for myself for Monday morning to check. cool and i might even talk to this weekend but um yeah i'm not trying to do extra extra stuff but i you know for me if i can get it set up it i mean that's what we're trying to do a couple months ago so if we can that's great if not um but i have been doing is just doing it manually and if i gotta pay forward or pay advance or pay head or whatever um we could do that for a month yeah it's yeah it should um it should go through tomorrow but i'll let you know i'll definitely check on it for you. Okay. Awesome. I appreciate it. Alrighty. Well, have a wonderful weekend. Thanks. You do the same thing, Robin. Alrighty. Thanks. Take care. Bye.",
