I think we're on two phone calls. Okay, so I'll stop this. Well, I think I ended the other one, but now it's echoing. Okay, so... Are you on audio? Oh, you know what it might be? I think it's the here no you left the meeting okay so I sent you a password reset form but it comes from William Kubitschek okay so you'll need to go into that form open a document okay okay Okay. Okay, I got it. And if I knew my username, I might have been able to guess my password, if that would have made things a lot easier. But it's probably too late now, right? Well, we could try what you thought it was going to be, because once you sign that form and I get the confirmation, I'm just going to go in and reset it to whatever you want it to be. Okay. Just trying real quick. Does it have to be a, like a, okay, I think we got it. I got it. Are you in? I think so. So I'm going to save that. Yeah, I appear to be in. Yeah. Oh, okay. Then we don't need this form. We didn't actually, we didn't change anything at this point, right? No, not at all. okay all right i'm in and i saved it back to my password manager okay so what i'm going to do this um form i just sent you don't even bother signing it i'm just going to delete it perfect and i'll just put email okay yeah i didn't do anything as far as getting you in yet so well good and that's probably what your other stuff is connected to and no change is needed anything else i can help you with well do i okay i won't worry about it right now if i have any more problems like if i have any problems on the other piece of it i'll call back it's not okay all righty we'll have a great fourth of july you as well all righty bye",
