    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hello, Garrett. I see you're on, but I see you're muted. And that's okay. Everyone needs to be muted sometimes. Hello, Bernadette. Do you hear me? Hello. How are you? I'm doing okay. How are you? I'm not too bad. Not too bad. I've got Garrett on the phone as well. yep so i first started using pc recruiter when i was with a um a search firm called global search group do you remember them i i've heard of them yeah yeah global search group they were based in south florida yeah excellent i'm just just looking them up there seeing if they're still using my batman hot because it's been a long time yeah i don't know if he's still in business he might have retired Mark Wench, it was a W-E-U-N-E-S-C-H or something. Jerry Wench, maybe Jerry. I'm just looking them up, seeing that name sounds familiar. I don't find them. But yeah, anyway. Anyway, so welcome back to PC Recruiter. Glad to have you back on board. and so what we wanted to do today is I know you're familiar you were a super user weren't you in the past yeah I was at some point so I'm very familiar with you know the roll-up concept and then you know also you know just adding things in there and then moving them around to like a requisition and having the open jobs and I what I really need to do is I need to customize the system, you know. And so I kind of went around and tooled around a little bit. And yesterday, I added a company, I added a, you know, I added some candidates, I added some activity, you know, just a handful of little things. But, you know, I, what I did was I, I outlined, I made a little outline for myself for fields that I want to, you know, kind of just change the name of them, maybe existing fields. And if they already had a drop down menu, just redefining that, and then also adding some fields. And I didn't see how to do that. So I don't know if I have the functionality in there to do that, I guess. Probably you do, most likely, I would imagine, because you're logged in as admin still. I did. And I saw some customizations where I could add certain fields, but I didn't see where I could add a field and then decide what kind of field is it going to be. Is it going to be an open field? Is it going to be a predefined field? Is it going to be a pull-down menu? I didn't see how to do that. Oh, it's like numbers. They're just like field type 1, 2, and then they're kind of explained in the drop-down in the custom field creation area. But we can take a look at that. I'm having a hard time hearing you. My headset's starting to go. I think I've been on it all day, so I think it's starting to get a little low battery there. But I'm actually going to turn you over to Garrett, because Garrett is going to be your trainer on PC Recruiter. He's an expert. and he is going to be the one who's going to kind of get you on the system, go over all the how-tos and all of that good stuff. And to start today, he has about, I'd say about a dozen, maybe 15 questions to ask you to kind of get an idea of your experience, your setup, what you're doing, what you're looking to do, stuff like that. At the conclusion of today, if you wish, he can get a call or two on the schedule for you to get some training hours set up. I'm going to be anyone, if you need to add usernames, have account-related questions, anything like that, come to me for that. Or if you don't know who to get, I can get you to the right person. But Garrett's going to be the primary person to go through your training and everything like that. So let me turn everything over to Garrett to go through those questions, and then he will go ahead and get something scheduled. So Garrett, I'll turn everything over to you. How's it going? Thanks, Jim. Nice to meet you, Bernadette. Hi, Nick. So a couple of questions we have here. what industry are you going to be recruiting in or working in? Yeah, so we're in the insurance industry. And what I'm going to tell you is that I'll just give you a background. It's probably going to answer a bunch of your questions, if that's okay with you, right? So we're in the insurance industry. We're a small regional broker. We only have 120 employees, and we only have a handful of types of positions that we hire for repetitively. Okay, so we hire for sales producers, but those sales producers could have, you know, certain specialties. So there could be under sales producers, there could be like, you know, four different kinds of sales people. And that's it. You know, and then we have account management, so we have sales and service. And then we have service positions. And the service positions are kind of almost categorized together. And we just really hire, you know, some of the titles might vary based on the amount of experience and the complexity of the accounts they do. But in general, we call it account management. Okay. So we have sales, production, and account management. And those positions are repeated, you know, for the life of the organization. You know, then they have, you know, sporadic needs every once in a while where we might need somebody in accounting. We might need somebody in IT. We might need somebody that just is like, you know, office administration, you know, that type of thing. But mostly what I'm going to be using this for is those repetitive positions. You know, so I'm going to be having, you know, I'm familiar with the roll-up concept. So I'm going to be consistently adding things to the roll-up. and as I see fit, I'm going to move them open to open requisitions that we have. And so that's probably the way I'm going to be doing business. So what we do is very specific, and I've used PC Recruiter in the past. I haven't used it in probably almost 10 years. So the interface is different, but it seems like the functionality is pretty much the same. It looks like you've had some enhancements with, you know, some integration with social media, which is wonderful. The tools that I'm going to be using are going to be LinkedIn Recruiter. And we don't actually have a career site right now, but I'm recommending that they update their website with the career site. So that is something that we would like to do as well. So that probably answers, I hope that answers a lot of your questions. Yeah, that's definitely helpful. Awesome. And will you have any more admin level users besides yourself? So, no. Okay. There won't be any. No. All right. And then let's see. We'll have Learning Center. I'll cover that in our first training just to show you where that is. Do you use a Windows or a Mac? I use Windows. Perfect. What's your preferred browser? Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge? That's my favorite. And who's your email provider? So I have I have a Gmail. And then we use Microsoft, I think with ours, we use like Office 365. Yeah, I think it's Office 365. It might have. It's not an exchange account. It's the other Microsoft, whatever that is. Yeah. OK, excellent. So you said you're going to use LinkedIn recruiter. I noted that. Excellent. And then the job board might come later. That's perfect. OK, cool. Yeah. Those are all my questions. I think probably not job boards, you know, because in our industry is so specific, you know, our postings are probably going to be mostly on LinkedIn and then our personal Web site, you know, which we don't have a career website right now. You know, we don't have any jobs posted on it. So not job boards. So I just wanted to clarify that. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Well, when you are posting your positions onto your own website, we just call that the job board feature. But that's coming, you know, down the line, it sounds like, which is totally fine. Exactly. Perfect. Okay. That looks good to me. So let's schedule our first training. These will be an hour long. And you do have a good handful of hours there. Um, so maybe just put one or two on the books now. And then if we decide we need more, we can schedule those at the time of our meeting. Um, all right. So I do have availability. Uh, I have one slot available tomorrow at 1130 Eastern, 30 AM Eastern. And then next week I have a lot more availability. If there's days next week, you would prefer. Yeah, right now. I mean, I just started with the company, you know, this is my third week. So, and my priority is to get this thing up and running right now. So what I've been doing just to let you know is I have a bunch of stuff in a spreadsheet. I also have a bunch of stuff, resumes in a little library that I want to, you know, upload. And then I also have the LinkedIn recruiter account that I'll be transferring information. So right now I've been cultivating all that stuff. So I have stuff that I need to put into the database. And that's before I start using it more proactively. I just want to get the system customized. And once it's customized, get the stuff uploaded. And then add my jobs. And then I'll start, you know, doing my actual functions. That sounds good. Yeah. So 1130 for me works great tomorrow. And then next week, you know, the sooner the better for me. So, let's see. Monday, I have one slot. That same slot is available, the 1130 on Monday the 22nd. Tuesday, I have 10 a.m. and 1130, as well as 230 p.m. Okay, why don't we do Tuesday at the 23rd at 10 a.m.? 10 a.m., okay. Excellent. So tomorrow, 1130, and then the 23rd, Tuesday at 10 a.m. Yeah, that works. Perfect. I'll send you invites to each of those. And then, yeah, as we hit our trainings, we can schedule more. So that'll be perfect. Sounds good. That's everything I needed today. Anything else you wanted to add, Jim? No, I don't think so. I look forward to just getting something scheduled and getting up and running. But, yeah, I don't have anything more at this time. Awesome. Any questions for us, Bernadette, before we hop off? I don't think so. Okay, excellent. Well, thanks so much for your time. I do have one question. Is there anything we just talked about that's not included with the initial training? Initial training, the plan is to make sure that your email is connected to your username, that you have the capture tool installed so you can use LinkedIn, and you did mention the resume pile of resumes you have, so we can get the resume inhaler set up as well. So once we get those pieces set up, with any remaining time, I'll just show you the quick tricks to getting custom fields added to your database. That's what I need. Yeah. Okay. All right. Awesome. That's it. Very cool. I'm ready to go. All righty. Well, thanks for your time. Thank you. And we'll talk to you soon. Oh, the training's not today? No, the first one is going to start tomorrow. Yeah, that's what we just scheduled. Oh, okay. I thought it was a training session today, too. Okay. This is just an introduction to talk about scheduling training. Okay. Gotcha. Sorry. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Then no problem. So, tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow at 10 a.m. Sounds good. Tomorrow at 11.30. 11.30. Got it. Yep. Perfect. All right. Thank you. All right. Have a great night. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Bye-bye.",
