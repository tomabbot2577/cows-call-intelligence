Yes, just one moment, please. Thank you for calling Survival Systems. This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance. John speaking. Hi, John. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, I'm doing well, yourself? Not too bad. Not too bad. Wanted to give you a quick call and follow up with you. I got an inquiry from you, I think, mid-last week or something. I don't know if it was around the AI or what. Oh, is it the AI searching stuff? Yeah, just wanted to see if you still needed any assistance or had any questions or what. Yeah, yeah. So we – and I'm going to probably botch it, but I think it's like Lucene. Is that the new indexing? Yeah. So we pulled the trigger on that. I don't notice any differences, though, in my front – like in the search. Like the AI doesn't pop up as an option in the search bar yet. So I wasn't sure if we ended up doing the right, because we have four different databases, I guess, within our stuff. Maybe we accidentally pushed the wrong one. I'm not sure. Well, let me see if they have a ticket in or anything showing. Okay, well, which database should it have been in? It should be the uploaded data one. Okay, and it looks like just yesterday they pushed down. So the reindex may not be done yet because it was late yesterday that it was sent over to our tech team and asked to update. But I'm going to update the ticket to make sure they get the right database. Once they do, the searching will be a little different. Then you'll notice the AI searching is going to be up there as well. It'll be good to go. And then if you have any questions, give me a call and give me a ring, or our support team can help you as well. But I'll add that it should be the uploaded data database. Perfect. All right. Thank you for reaching out. I really appreciate it. Not a problem, sir. I'll update that ticket for you. All right. Have a great day. You too.",
