    "text": " It was too sunny out. Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, this is Ernie Bivona. We spoke earlier today about the mail issue I was having. Oh, yeah. Well, it's doing the same thing. And I was able to get it to open up, but it doesn't, it's hiding. So I don't know how to do that. It's the pop-ups that are kind of still appearing weird or not popping up completely? Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, and I just put this person's email in, and then it just disappeared. So I was going to show you on this particular candidate, but I can't do that. I mean, the whole screen seems to be a little bit too big. I'm not sure how I can – it's not fitting the computer screen. Okay. Okay. Here, yeah, let's do a screen share, and then I'll get a better sense of what you're looking at. If you just want to go to a new tab in your browser, and then go to meetings.ringcentral.com. And that's meetings plural, so meetings.ringcentral.com. meetings yeah meetings period meetings period ring central dot com okay join meeting perfect and I can give you that meeting ID whenever you're ready yeah I'm ready Okay, that's 117-958-042. Join. Cool. I see you joined there. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio. It's already on the phone. Use your microphone. Use your camera. What am I doing here? Can I allow all this time? Yeah, you can hit allow, but we won't turn it all on. It'll be just allowed, I guess, but not used. Okay. And then... Join audio. by computer or without computer? Can you hear all the noise? Continue without audio. No, I can't hear any noise. Cannot. Okay. All right. And then once you continue without audio, you should see a blue share button down at the bottom of that RingCentral meeting. Click on that and select your entire screen up at the top. it'll say entire screen and then you could choose if you have multiple screens or just click screen one you just have one screen okay i did yeah and then hit share this should be yeah where's share um it might be at the bottom right so if you hit um Here, let me try to do it. It's not lit up. Oh, you'll have to click on screen one to kind of highlight it and select it first. Then you can hit the blue share button. Okay. There you go. There we go. I can see that. Okay. So, perfect. I can see RingCentral pulled up. Go ahead and open back up PCR. It might be kind of hiding behind this screen if you want to minimize it way up at the top. Where do you want me to go? You could minimize this screen and then we could take a look at PCR. You might have that open somewhere. Let's see. There we go. Click on that one. Okay. The problem is this guy, I saved his email address, but it's gone. I don't know where it went. Oh, okay. I thought it was somebody else. It's missing. Let me see if I can find it. I don't know how I can go to – just so I can duplicate exactly where he was. It was this guy. But I'm not sure. This is crazy. There was another screen that was able to... Let's go to somebody else because I can't figure out how to get to the other... You know what? We could check Bill's changelog is what it's called. And we could see if there's an email address that got changed to a blank. but it was there before. Maybe it's in the change log. So, yeah, let's check that. Click on Bill's name again. And then in that bar where it says edit name, resume, interviews, all the way to the right, click on the three horizontal lines. You're right there. Perfect. And now I got the candidate from your line. Hold on a second. Hopefully. Hopefully. Maria we're on I'm on another call now so we're there for 20 minutes I don't know what happened Maria hello Maria I'm on another call now you're waiting for 20 minutes and We can do the call tomorrow. Maria? Maria? Oh, shoot. Are you still there? Can you hear me all right? I can. Yeah, I don't know what happened to her. She didn't join the meeting. She called and I said, we'll do it tomorrow, but I still didn't hear. I think we're getting a lot of bad roll-up notes, attachment. Yeah, so click on the three horizontal lines to the right there. Details? No, farther to the right. You just had the three horizontal lines clicked on right there. Click on that and then go to change log. It's kind of on the left. It's in the third column. There we go. Okay, so this would show you if a record had a value. and then it was changed to something else. So if it had an email address, then maybe it was removed. But it doesn't look like it saved anything for Bill. Do you have any other examples? No. Let's see what this one does. Let's see. If I go make a call here. This? See that? Oh, okay. I see what you're doing. There's what it's showing you there. Okay. Okay. So if you... And sometimes I can do something that brings it up, but other times it just, I don't know what I do, but all of a sudden the whole screen comes up. That is weird. If you put your cursor in there and start typing, does it go change at all or no? Okay. Nope. Okay. Still tiny. That's really strange. Let's do this. We'll do a clear cache again. I haven't seen that one yet. Okay, so at the top right of your browser, you want to go to the three dots. You might have to drag that over a little bit. There we go. Three dots. Go down to more tools towards the bottom and then developer tools. And we'll ignore all this that just popped up and then go to your web address up at the top. www. to the left of that, right click on that. Hit cancel on that actually. That new pop-up, hit cancel. You want to right click on the, there we go, then go to empty cache and hard reload. Perfect. And then reload. So that's good. So that'll slowly reload PCR. You can close these developer tools at the top right there's an X okay and then reopen PCR in a new tab perfect and we'll sign in and see if we're still getting that same issue Then this whole thing is just so big. I don't know how that happened. Okay, yeah, we could look at that next. Maybe that's contributing to it, too. Yep, same thing happening. Okay, let's try to make things a little bit smaller on your browser. So if you want to close that pop-up, go to the three dots at the top right again, and there should be something that says zoom. Oh, it said 100% zoom. I was thinking it was a much higher number zoom. That's strange. I just changed it to 90. Now let's see what happens. Okay. That's working a little bit better. So yeah, if you just want to keep it zoomed out at 90%, maybe that'll work. Let's try maybe one other person to make sure it doesn't switch when you try that. Okay. Still. I mean, that's still not. Not full. Yeah. At the bottom right where it says 31 words, there's a little. Yeah, use that and drag that around. See if it adjusts the white area at all. You can resize. Okay. It's really strange. Look where the signature block is and then all this. Yeah, that is behaving a little strangely. What else can we look at? Maybe let's do the extensions. Let's see what extensions are running. Sometimes they don't play nice with PCR. So you can close that pop-up you see there. Go down to manage extensions down at the bottom. Zoom clone, this is Excel and so is PC. What is that? Why are they? Oh, that's just mean they're pinned. Yeah, those are pins. So it means that those icons are at the top right of the browser without having to click on the puzzle piece. Go ahead and scroll down. We'll just take a look at this list, see if there's anything strange there. So Adobe Acrobat's normal. Everybody kind of has that one. Last pass. Okay. Capture. Smart search by Woo. Now, this is interesting. The Zoom info engaged Chrome extension. Then the Zoom info. So I don't know what the difference is. But now Zoom Info was giving me a lot of trouble just trying to get into it. And I got into it yesterday, but it was really just, it wasn't allowing me to get to where I wanted to go. And here it is. I don't know what's going on here. Okay, let's try at the bottom, let's toggle off the second Zoom Info one with the little toggle at the bottom right. Just temporarily turn that off. And let's see if that makes any difference if we go back to PCR, whichever tab you had open. Okay, here we go. There we go. Okay, that opened up. Okay, at least that's working. That's good. I'm going to type in my pin, but anyway. I mean, I can go into Zoom Info. Yeah. No, that's okay. But, yeah, at least we know that that icon is working at the top right when you click on the Zoom Info logo. Now, this is giving me a full screen. Okay, that's a good sign. Let's go to... Let's see, where did this email come from? There wasn't an email in the system. Oh, I would copy that while it's on the screen. If you just want to... Oh, this is an older session. Okay, I see. You could close that. Hover over that and write that down, the email there, so you can pop it in on a session that you're signed into. There it is right there. Oh, yeah. Copy that. This is the session you're not logged into. That's why it's there. These are all old sessions. You've got to close these out and open a new session. Yeah, that one's still old. I think that's the real one. So we're on someone else there. That still doesn't tell us Yeah let's see Yeah It didn't say But you can enter it in I think it was just the Oh there we go Yeah I cannot copy that Nope It's kind of blanked out I'm not sure. See that? If you hover over it, does it list his email address? No, yeah, I don't think that's going to be empty when you send it. But I did look a second ago. It was just the W and his last name at gmail.com if you want to enter that in on his record. What's going on here? That still doesn't answer the reason. It looks like you forgot an L there. C-O-L-N-O-W. I'll put in a W. There it is. Okay, go ahead and save that. And then let's test that again to see if the window shows up correctly or not. Nope, still kind of just halfway. Oh, there it is. Yeah, the email's good. It's just that white box below is still giving trouble, even with that Zoom info turned off. If you go ahead and close that pop-up and then click on the expand, far at the top right, instead of clicking like the X to close everything, right above that there's the square. Yeah, click on that to get full screen. Okay, that minimized it. There, okay, so now you're full screen. Yeah, you're full screen now. So let's see if that makes a difference when you're sending that email. Click on the email button. Still having trouble. Just kind of resizes, it looks like, to fit. Is this a different computer than you're usually using? No, this is my regular computer. It's at home, but it's because I'm working from home. So I just transported it from the office to my house. Oh, okay. Let me see if I can recreate that. I'm going to try to open the screen. Let's try that. Oh, yeah, mine's doing the same thing where on my smaller, let's see, laptop screen, and then I'm going to drag it over to my big screen here. Well, it's on a big screen. Oh, okay. Let's see. All right. Now I'm on my laptop, and it's showing the same thing. Okay. Yeah, it seems like it resizes the white box depending on the screen size or screen resolution. I was able to recreate it on my laptop screen, but where it kind of just resizes that white box. But as you type or scroll down, I think it'll expand. So it should allow you to just type in everything you need and it'll expand as you type to see the full message. So yeah, it doesn't stay, you know, half screen. You can always just type to expand that. Right. Okay. Anything else that you noticed was giving you trouble PCR today? No, but again, it was, well, we changed it to 90%. It doesn't make it come out as big. And let me just check something else because this is also crazy size. Now, this looks smaller than, which is fine. When I was looking at it before, it was just unbelievably large. What the heck is going on? Yeah, that is strange. That's up to candidates. I saw a note from Maria. I don't know what happened to it. Wow. It is strange. What email was she sending it to? Look what went all the way over here. I saw her send something but I don't even see it now maybe it's in oh here it is so any suggestions any figure out what it was it might be that when you so if you have your like a laptop and you're plugging it into an external screen, is that what's going on? It kind of readjusts the screen resolution when you do that. So you might see it one way on your laptop, but once it gets plugged into an external screen, it'll kind of readjust things to make it look either smaller or larger. So I think that's all that's happening. It's just a screen resolution change. but you can kind of use that zoom that we saw to make up for it possibly. This is just the computer, the laptop and then this, is it like this or are you talking about something else? The three dots at the top right where we went to 90%. You could always kind of use that to even out sizing there. Yeah, okay, full screen. I didn't realize that was there. That's cool. Wow. Yeah, you could even go above 100%. So, yeah, if you're plugging into an external monitor and things seem a little zoomed out or zoomed in, you can kind of use that zoom as a way to counteract it. Okay. Awesome. Yeah, just let us know if you notice anything else strange or anything else that's weird in the display there on PCR. It just started doing it today. Okay. Yeah, it might be just because you're at home and using that particular monitor to plug into. No, but I'm using the monitor. I mean, this is a setup I've had for at least a year and a half. Okay. I had a different computer here. It was the same model, but all right. Yeah, it could be a display setting there. yeah feel free to play around with your your settings and display maybe the scale or the display resolution might might help I'm not sure but the it seems like just kind of a monitor thing yeah there you go there's scale display resolution Okay, I think it's recommending to keep that how that is. If you go back at the top left there, there you go, and hit it one more time. Go down to display resolution where it goes 1600 by 900. See if there's a different option in there that works that feels more familiar. maybe the one right below it, and it'll kind of readjust your screen for a second. And you can either keep or revert back. So yeah, that's another. Then now this gets a little too small. Oh, okay. Yeah, maybe you would try a different one or go back to that 1600 one. No, let's go back to PCR. Nope. Yeah, that one looks a little bit more zoomed in. It's a little bit tinier. Yeah, I would go back to settings and change it back to maybe the 1600 or try a different one. And those are going to be kind of in the background. Yep. So, yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah, so I guess just play around with some of those, see if any of those feel better, and then let us know if you have any other issues with that. Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. All right. Have a good one. Bye. Bye.",
