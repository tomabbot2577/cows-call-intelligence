    "text": " Hello, this is Kirk. Hello, Kirk. Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm doing good today, Jim. How are you? I'm well. I am well. We finally connected. Wanted to kind of check in, see how I can help. Well, I'm looking at database programs, and I've used PCR Recruiter in the past, but it's been a while, or I'm a little bit familiar with it. and I was looking at different systems basically. So I was kind of wondering, you know, what do you guys – I think you're what, $90 a month per seat? A little more than that now. We're between $95 and $115, so right around $100. What's the difference between $95 and $115? Well, the $95 is our enterprise package. So the $95 per user per month is a one-year commitment on our enterprise package, and that's going to be the basic PC recruiter, job board integration, Outlook integration, our Capture app for importing from LinkedIn, et cetera, and the resume inhaler for bulk parsing. If you wanted the sequencing, email campaigns, and the advanced analytics reporting, that is the $115 per month package. That's called the premium package, and that includes all the stuff we have, pretty much everything we've got. so that's what for me to be me to do a mass email marketing campaigns that's what I would need you get you put them on premium because that includes the mass email marketing and then it's also a nice reporting piece you can click look at opens unsubscribes what they clicked how many times they open it all of that good stuff and then the sequencing you could even build on that and say that if they open it then do this or if they don't acknowledge it in three days, then send another email or anything like that. Okay. What kind of training comes with that? You get 10 hours. So you get 10 hours training with that. So that is a 750 setup that includes creation of the database, help hooking it into your website, your Outlook, installing the capture, all of the setup and install, and then the 10 hours training is included with that as well. And that's good for six months. What's good for six months? The training? The training, yeah. It's good for six months. So you can use it any time in the first six months. Usually they try and do a lot, the bulk of it in the first 30 days. They get you up and running on the system. But if you add people down the line, you can save it for up to six months to use. And did you say $750 just to get signed up? Now, since you're a previous user, I could probably drop it to $600. So I do have a little leeway on that because it covers training, but also the database creation, installation setup, some of the other stuff too. So I can drop it a little since you'd be a returning customer. And for that price, it's a one-year commitment? Mm-hmm. Okay. And if you want to do month-to-month, that's $125 per user per month for the premium. So that's a month to month. But all of our contracts also include a 90-day acceptance period. So no matter what you're on, you have a 90-day time period that you can utilize and get your training underway, get everything up and running. And then if for any reason it doesn't work within that time frame, you can cancel it. No early terminations, no questions asked. Okay. What else am I thinking right now I need to know about? So that's pretty much it. I'm just comparing different things, different companies right now, trying to figure out who I want to go with. PCR, it's a little dated. It's a little clunky. It's not very intuitive, but I already know how to use it. We do also have a new product called the PCRM, and that is going to be a little bit more up-to-date. It has some CRM functionalities as well, so you have some different things in that. So we have a newer version available as well. Okay. All right. That's what I needed to know. Let me think it over. Like I said, I'm comparing different things and looking at different stuff. Fantastic. And yeah, so you'd get the new PCRM version as well. And I could probably even just get you the enterprise setup of 500 for the premium package. If that helps, just since you're comparing, I want to put my best foot forward. I could probably do that 10 hours training for 500 setup since you're returning. Okay Let me think I'll be back in touch with you I got you in here Very well Okay thanks I'll be here",
