    "text": " Hi, this is Mary. Hi, Mary. It's Robin Montoni with Main Sequence, PC Recruiter. Hi, Robin. How are you? Yeah, thanks for getting back to me. Yeah, can you check on the status of my credit card and if it's showing an expiration date? It only shows me, so I only can see the last four digits. Is that the one starting with 3-3 something? Wait, wait. Oh, shoot, I just had this up. Hold on one second. Let me pull it back up. I literally just hit up next and I closed it. It's $33.27. That's the only thing it lets me see. All right. So I'm concerned. Apparently Visa has a system that if people see that, you know, the same vendor's been using the same card and the only difference is that the month is, you know, lapsed after, you know, five-year period, right, that a lot of times Visa will inform the vendor without going through me. But then sometimes I notice that certain vendors aren't getting that alert. So should we redo or what should we do to make sure that next, because my card is supposedly same number, but different expiration at the end of June, hence my call. So it is probably better for me to walk you through like where you would maintain it from what I'm experiencing. I'm going to send you an invite right now. Okay. All right. Okay. Let me get on my clip. Let me get on this. I'm analog. I still do the phone thing. So I didn't have my computer up, but I will get it up real fast. Bear with me. Mary at biotech.com, right? Yes. Okay. Hang on. I'm not sure if I even know off hand what my... Bear with me. Just coming in from outside. It is so sunny out that my eyes are adjusting. Bear with me. several days of that it was pretty darn nice here in Cleveland to experience that now it's raining again of course good did you so for the 4th of July did you have any happening oh it was gorgeous all weekend okay beautiful 90 almost like too hot it's like 90 yeah great okay let's see here with me. We found this one fabulous winery and it was so hot but it was wonderful. Great band playing, beautiful place, great food. Every weekend should be a long weekend I think. I know I really enjoyed it. So let's see let me see main PCR let's see if I can um hang on so what i sent you so this new billing system that we have it has this customer billing portal and which is really nice so that way like when your card expires if you just want to use a different one you could go in any time and change it um it just seems like it wants you to change it rather than me. So what I did is I sent you an invite to it. The email will come from billing at main sequence dot net. Let me know when you get that email because I have to walk you through some steps. Okay. All right. I am looking at the email. Should I hit the so what you'll need to do yeah there's a link in there or actually you have to click sign up when you click the link you'll have to click sign up or is it sign up or create an account I forgot how it's called okay and then when you create the account you'll have to do it as Mary at biotech or calm because that's the email that we have for your billing all right all right and then I need to make up a password that's different than what I'm using on the other. It could be, it could be whatever you want. It's just this is completely separate because it's, it's completely separate. Okay, yeah, so it could be whatever you want. You could make it be the same if it's easier for you. All right, that's up to you but all right hang on let me go let me come up with Let me try this. So I'm going to come up with a new password. Yeah, whatever you wanted to do. It may not fit for you because it's got some restrictions on what it can be. All right. And then let's see. Hold on. All right. It's weird that it doesn't let you see what you just typed. Hopefully, you know, it doesn't give you the option to see what you've just done. So hopefully I typed it the way I thought I typed it. I think if you have, like, Google, I think it'll ask you, it'll prompt you, do you want to say what they believe? Yes, yes, and it's secure to log in. All right. Now what it usually does is it sends you an email just to make sure it's you. Okay an email will be sent. Okay let's do it. There it is and we're going to watch this is some code confirm email just by click here to get the email and let's see. Okay, I'm in a thing that says invoices history profile vault. Okay, so what you're going to want to do is go to the vault area. That's where you can manage your payment method. Okay, all right, and let's see if it lets me just do my, it doesn't let me interestingly it doesn't ask me for the expiration it only asks me for the so I'm same thing as you it shows let me see I go on it's not a new card it does ask for my you know, my CV number, which, by the way, hold on, I have to run to the other room. That's my first thing. Okay. Okay. It shows the same last number, and it wants, it's odd that it doesn't ask about expiration. Is there an edit option? No, it's not. It goes payment method, ends in 392, 3327. So I picked that and there's no amount on there. I'm also wondering if I should go new card just to play it safe because it's immediately asking for my CVV number, which I know is a security number. Let's see what happens. I agree to pay invoice as well I'm on is there anything on here that shows I'm auto you know remote auto or whatever auto payment usually when you go in and you hit I believe edit like once you click on the card or whatever it'll ask you for that okay we did a screen share and then I could see a little bit better okay hold on one second Okay. All right. I'm going in from another view, so sometimes I'm getting a little stuck here because it's still a little bit new. Okay. So let me see. Usually once I'm in, I kind of stumble my way around there. Okay. Okay. So let's see. Marriott Biotech. And you can see I put a CVD number in there. Okay. I just sent you a link to join a meeting. When it's asking you about showing camera or microphone, we don't need either one of those options because we're going to be watching your screen, so we don't need your camera. And since we're on the phone, you don't need the computer audio. Okay. Did you do it by email? Yeah. And that one will come from me directly, robin at mainsequence.net. Okay, join call. No, okay. Microphone and camera. Just continue without microphone and camera. Right, yeah, correct. All right, allow. So do you see me? No, what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of that meeting screen, there's a square, or I'm sorry, a rectangle with an arrow. Click on that. and that's going to pop up another window go over to where it says entire screen okay let's see um i see a rectangular thing uh permission it it has like an x on on the microphone and an x on the um on the camera um so i wonder if i have to click at least one of those to get it. It should say share screen right after that camera one. It's the rectangle with the arrow pointing up. There's no arrow, but it says ready to join. How about ask to join? So I just do that. Oh, oh, yes, yes. I guess you're not in a meeting yet. Yes, please. I'm so sorry. Okay. So now you just need the share screen option at the bottom. okay okay yeah let's see um okay uh then you're going to go over to entire screen once that window pops up okay i see you robin montoni yes um is that your married name by the way yes i'm irish that's usually the mix i'm half i'm i'm irish and italian i'm a result of that mix so Okay, so I'm at the bottom right. It says name not available. Yeah, that's okay. You just joined without putting your name in. That's okay. So at the bottom of your meeting screen, though, you can see the share screen. It's the rectangle with the arrow. You want to click that. Okay, I'm not seeing a rectangle with an arrow, but bear with me. So are you looking at the same thing I'm looking at right now? Or no, no, you want to be able to do that. I am looking at a rectangle, just to say. And at the bottom, there's like a lot of different linking things. There's one that says people to chat with everyone. to know meeting tools. I wonder if it's down there. It should be like right like well at least the box is blue where you might be seeing my name my face in the middle at the very bottom of there. Okay below that I'm seeing an eye a thing with an eye that has the eye for meeting details a thing that shows people a thing that shows chat with everyone and then you know kind of a way over to the left more. Oh, more to the left. Okay. More options, more options. Turn on captions. I'm sorry, share screen. Okay. It's right in the dead middle, share screen. Okay. All right, share screen. And then go over to entire screen. Okay. Let's see. Which is going to be at the right oh i see yeah okay okay and then if you have more than one monitor you're like you got to pick which one to show just in case you have one more than one monitor okay perfect all right good good okay um sir somebody just hit this up so you can see my you can see my my um yeah so okay i know this looks a little funny go over keep this tab up but we're not going to use it we just don't want to exit it go over to one of those tabs that have the billing portal okay I will okay let's see I'm going to go back here I think let's see um go up at the top left okay uh yeah go to one of those first two tabs okay um this one okay gotcha okay do you see under vault now. Okay. So you have payment method, chose a card and then it just goes amount and then it has the CDV but no reference to expiration. Okay. Let's try the new card option. Did you click vault? Actually, you know what? You might be in the invoices area. Did you actually click vault? Let's see. Let me hit it. There we go. Okay. Okay. Auto-pay. Yes. Okay. That's a good sign. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Let's see. Maybe should I go on, click on this card, see if it gives me the option? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't see a... Okay. So what we might have to do, let's hit delete over at the left. Okay, so this, where it's my name card. Yes, that's the card that's stored. Let's see if we can delete that yet. Okay. Payment method will be deleted. That could be okay, correct? Yes. If it's not showing us just to change the date, we might just have to re-add it. Okay. Okay, I see. Okay, exit for a moment. Exit that little banner. It's up at the top right. Okay. Hold on. Thanks. Bear with me. No, no, no. No, no, no. Down a little bit more. Sorry. I didn't want you to lose the meeting. See, like in that little banner that popped up, there's a faint little X. It's right underneath your bookmarks, but over to the right. Unable delete payment method. Yeah, follow that. Perfect. And hit that little X. Yeah. So I think what it's asking us to do, see where it says auto pay invoices, say no. Over to the right. I'm sorry. I'm not. I'm back here looking at the vault. I'm looking at your auto pay invoices. Okay. Yeah, turn that to no. Okay. Yeah, it seems like before you can delete it, you've got to turn that off. Okay, so now let's try delete on that row that we were trying before. Okay, let's go over here. Delete. And then. Okay, now let's say okay. All right. If it lets us now. All right, the payment method is set up for auto-pay. Oh, okay. We did, didn't we? Okay, I think maybe we didn't save it. Okay, so let's hit that little green X again. Okay, I'm going to do the little X to the right, and I'm going to hit save. Yeah, let's hit save first. Okay, okay. Now I'll try to delete this card, correct? Yeah. And you're sure it's not, I just can't just click on it, see if it lets me? It doesn't, I'm not seeing anything for editing. So that's why... going to try this way. Okay, payment method deleted. Okay, we're going to do okay. Yeah, let's try that now. Okay, so now let's try adding payment method. Okay, do we need to save again or no? Not yet. Okay, and then it says stored card. Okay, try that. Okay, let's see if it shows anything. Let me see. Okay, I'll do the card here. Yeah, it doesn't let you edit the card. Let's me do a new card. Yeah. Okay. And let's see. 0630, which is really a weird year. I'm feeling old okay let's see 427 0 8 9 0 1 2 8 6 3 3 2 7 okay and then there is that checkbox for enable auto pay for future transactions okay let's hit save okay and let's see does it do we need to double check that auto pay I'm not seeing anything there's no transmission oh those are so I think we're in business let's try should we go to another like click out of vaulting yeah let's try that let's do history and that's okay. Yeah, then let's go back over to Vault. Okay, and it says and it's Okay, so yeah, it looks like it's a little refresh there. Okay, should I hit save again too? I guess we did because it's showing now Yeah, I think we're good. Okay, I don't have to do save again for any No, it doesn't appear to me. If something happens, we'll reach out to let you know but I think that was it and lesson learned And for me, you cannot really edit any details. You can just turn off auto-pay, delete, and then re-add it. Okay, Robin. That sounds good. And if for some reason there's a fluke on payment, you'll have record that I attempted to update this, right? Absolutely. Okay. Well, thanks for getting back to me. That's one thing I can cross off of my to-do items today. No problem. And if you need anything else, just give us a call, okay? Okay. Thanks for your help, Robin. You are welcome. Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
