    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Hi, good morning, Robin. This is Jason Gibson with Sunset Transportation. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing pretty good. I just had a quick question regarding presentations. Okay. So I have, if I send a presentation, the PCR document, they attach well. They attach fine. However, when I have, so when people send me additional attachment candidates and I attach them to the name record, when I send a presentation, for some reason I can't send the attachment. it might be the setup of the template and what type of file is it some of them are PDF some of them are Word some of them are Excel the Excel ones will not I know you can do like Word and PDF but the Excel ones will not the other thing do you have a section that can pull from attachments in your template let me look at the template yeah because one would pull for like from resume then there's another there's really three types of sections that you can create one would be where you're picking a file from the resume area another one you can have multiple in case you want to divide them up you got to have it where it'd be giving you options to select from attachments and then there's like a summary like write-up area. Yeah. But when I, let me pull it up, I'll go to the position, select this candidate again. So I know that he has, if I look at his name record, his name is James Pipeline Activities. And you're in the database Sunset Transportation, is that correct? Uh-huh. okay and I didn't know if it James Grant failed methodology and case study alignment so if I go to let's just put his name in the presentation so you have different presentations what kind are you using you look like you have different setups I do I'm using the Armada director strategic sales okay you know what one thing I would wonder and I um I wonder if a comma in the template name would be any kind of issue next seems you mean under his under attachments on the template name well now that I'm looking at it the attachment shows as an attachment on his name it says James Grant dash or oh it might sales methodology and case study alignment so the ampersand may be blocking it I may want to leave it. Sometimes certain characters can cause issues pulling things. Attachment. Attachment. Attachment. Attachment. Attachment. Attachment. Attachment. additional info is from an attachment. Reference 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Those are all pulling from attachments. Okay. What is other additional info? Additional info is also where you'd be pulling from attachments. So it looks like you set it up to maybe in case they had just some other files. Yeah, that's exactly. But when you look at it, it doesn't show up in this screen. That's where I was like, wait a minute. How is that possible? So who are you presenting? What name are you on? If you look at James Grant, When you look under attachments, you can see that I've uploaded on July 31st, change grant sales methodology and case study alignment. Okay. So if we were to present him and just use any of the... Let's see. presentation. Picking the Armada director template and I will just do person snapshots. So what's an example of a file that won't show? If you look back at the name record it shows it says James Grant failed methodology and case study alignment. Oh, you know what? It's a PowerPoint. Oh, that one won't work either. Yeah. It's really just Word and PDF files. You can't do like PowerPoint or Excel's in here. In the presentation, can I attach a document? I wouldn't be a part of it. Let me see. Continue to sending now we're not be able to add there is no attachment option okay so that is likely why yeah it's just like worded PDFs that would be Yeah, they're trying to open up in PowerPoint. Now, if I send the presentation to myself and copy the body of it, I could send it to other people and they could click the presentation link. and I could attach the additional document to that individual email, correct? I think you could. I haven't really tried that. I'm wondering if you could take what's in the PowerPoint and make it more like a file. I don't know if they let you do that. I haven't been in PowerPoint in a really long time. I'm never in PowerPoint. I know. I never use it either. Let's see. I'm going to send this like this. I think this is what I'll have to do as a workaround. I'll just send it to myself. I just got the email and then I would take this email and forward it. The only thing that would be different is you have to be in the database to be able to, at least the main recipient has to be in the database and you wouldn't get the tracking. If they're not in the database? Right. You have to have your two recipient has to be somebody that's in the database and then because we need that for all the tracking like when somebody opens and views and all that kind of stuff that could be an issue what if I send it what if I'm sending it from my Outlook well just to generate the presentation somebody has to be a recipient that's in the database. And so, like I said, if you're sending it to you, that tracking is going to be with you. So when you open in view, it's not going to track the other person. I got you. So I need to add the – You're almost better off just doing the presentation and then just doing a follow-up email with the one extra file because I think that the situation of having a PowerPoint is probably pretty rare, I would assume. That might be the better option just in this particular case. I'd just say there's one I'd like to send you, but it's a PowerPoint, which cannot be included in what I sent you. Otherwise, you're going to lose all that tracking with the recipient. Yeah. Okay. All right. And with the recipient, they have to be in, obviously, they have to be in PCR. Correct. Yeah. The two-person can be, you can see somebody on it, but the two-person has to be a name record in the database. Excellent. So I'm sharing this with someone in our organization, and she does not want the hiring team to see the money, but there's no way to hide the money on the profile that they completed once it's been completed. it was the only solution of that is to create another profile without the money and just copy you're using like a profile form yeah i believe that would be the only yeah that's what i'm thinking too. Okay. Well, shit. Alright. I guess I'll need to work on that. You can hide fields in the profile, but if you're including a document and it happens to have it, there's no way to say when I'm sitting in a presentation, hide these questions and answers. You can hide fields, but you can't hide certain elements that are within a document. Okay. I think that's what it's going to have to be. I'm going to have to... It seems like every day is Monday, you know? alright well shit I appreciate it Robin I'm going to have a great week you too talk to you later bye",
