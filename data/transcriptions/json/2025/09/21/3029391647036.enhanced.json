    "text": " Hello? Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Adam Consiglio out in New Mexico. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Sorry to bother you, and I tried to find this without calling, but I can't find the recycle bin. Is it in System, or where is it at? Yeah, go to System, and then I usually just use that little search bar on the left. I did do that. What do you type in? Recycle? Yeah, just type in recycle. It should appear there on the right. Which results recycle? No, that's it. All right, so let me double check if you're signed in. You need to be a full admin. I am. I'm guessing you are. Okay. Let me try to find that. System search. Yeah, so as you type recycle, it doesn't show up there on the right. It says search results, colon, recycle. Are you using the search bar on the far left after going to system? Okay. Let me try. I'll just find it wherever it is. It's in one of these data management. Yeah. So if you go on the left, clear out your search results. I mean, your search. And then go to Data Management and then Recycling Bin. Hold on. I don't even see it. It's all over my screen. I got these pop-ups on my screen now. Okay, that went away. and go to data management and then where? Recycling should be on the right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay, I found it. Awesome. You guys changed your menu options on the phone. Yeah, I think that's been updated recently. I've heard. So, yeah, I think support and technical support have been just kind of melded into one option. But, yeah, I think that did just change. What do you mean? You joined up two departments? Yeah. So basically we used to have from what I've heard, we had we had multiple options. Do you want to just talk to customer support or technical support? And now it's just under one umbrella, just support. Okay. I'm trying to find a specific rollup. Is there a way to... I got like 15 pages of recycled rollups. Is there a way to search by alphabetically or no? There's no sorting options here, but you could at the top right where it says search descriptions, you could put in, start typing your rollup list name there and hit enter. No, it didn't work. I honestly don't know what I called it. Okay. I guess I'll have to just go through the whole list. Gotcha. Okay. Alright, yeah, just let me know if you have any other questions that pop up. Cool, thank you. Thanks. Okay, bye.",
