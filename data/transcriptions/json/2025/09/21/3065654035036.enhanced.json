Hello, Steve. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. You and I had been communicating last month about possibly you taking a look at PC Recruiter. or thought I'd give you a call, see if you were still looking for something, and see if we might set up a call to discuss it more. Please give me a call. Let me know if there's anything I can do. Happy to help. We could set up a call this week or next, if that works for you. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I'll pop you an email as well. Hopefully, we can connect. Thanks. Talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
