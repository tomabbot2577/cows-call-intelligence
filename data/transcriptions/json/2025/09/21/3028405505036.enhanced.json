    "text": " Hey, Martin. Ah, it's Jim. This is Linda. Oh, hi, Jim. How are you? Real well. How are you doing? Well, I'm kind of laid up in bed. I had to get some cortisone and some nerve blocks in my back for a vaccine. Mm-hmm. That's it. But I'm working. I don't know if I have my laptop here. But the new thing that rolled out, I saw your second message saying, that it should already be on first interview? I mean, first PCR? Yeah. I don't know if I can get my laptop. Let me open it. I have it here. Because I can't open it. You know, for some reason, I can't open it on my phone, your app. Oh, maybe it needs updated. It must need it updated. What do I do, delete it and reload it? I think you should be able to go, like, into your app store and just find it and update it from there. I don't think it'll prompt, that I know of, it doesn't prompt you. Like, sometimes your banking apps or your credit card apps will say, oh, you need an update. I don't think ours does that, but you should be able to just go to the app store and update the app from that. I don't know that we've updated recently, but maybe it just needs re-downloaded. Yes, okay, I'll do that. And I'm waiting for this to boot. So what is the new, what is the, is it an app or what is new that you guys have? Sure. What we recently have been kind of touting because they gave it away as a free trial for the summer is the AI suite. So we've added some AI functionality. And what we did is we applied it to everybody's database for the summer. Three about Labor Day is when it's going to be turned off. But what it does, it's kind of four main components. Three of them are content generators. So we've added, like, on the job description field, there's now a little button at the top of that that if you click it, it's going to produce a job description. And it will produce a job description kind of using the information found in the company record and the job record in the fields and stuff like that. So it'll make you a little job description. very similar functionality on the candidate summary screen. There's a little, that same little AI button. It's like kind of purple and blue and it looks like our logo, an outline of our logo. The candidate summary one will generate a candidate summary based off of information found in the candidate's fields and in their resume, if they have one. So those two... Wait a minute. Oh, that's first interview. Hold on a second. Let me find it. PC recruit. Is this it? Hold on. Okay. Oops. Yeah. So at least I can find it. See, all I see is new. Whenever it opens, it says, do you want it like in a soft, not a square, but in those soft angles or whatever it's called. And new and improvements, changing to capturing records. Those are the only things I've ever gotten to for any kind of notification. that was they put they add a kind of a new rounded look to some of the buttons so so that was a while back I mean that's the only thing I really got but hold on pc recruiter I'm going to make sure it's loading slowly but sure yeah so to kind of talk at the the third part there's an email generator. So that is going to, it adds that same little, that little PC Recruiter AI icon. And what that'll do, that is going to help you generate an email. So it's a little more like ChatGPT, if you will. So if you click it, it's going to ask you whether you want a friendly tone, a formal tone, an instructive tone. Then you pick that and it'll say, what's the purpose of this email is it a follow-up is it an offer is an initial contact stuff like that then it will generate kind of a gen a standard email and then from there once you you can kind of go back and forth with it and pick and choose like you can say mention the sales job or set a follow up for next week or something like that so it will kind of build an email off of what you're looking to do okay when I clicked on I guess the home page when it's signed in before I signed in it said PC Recruiter AI Suite. Is that what's new? Yep, that's what's new. And then introducing PCRM. What is that? PCRM is our new CRM package. And that's kind of another access point to PC Recruiter. It's like a newer interface, but it's also going to be a CRM package that adds a sales pipeline and also a simpler sequencing piece. I have never been able to set up a sales pipeline because it's too difficult for me because I find that there are so many, you know, the first thing you do is, you know, you start to prospect, you know, for a candidate. You know, you search for your candidates. Then, you know, you look at it. You know, I don't know how it's supposed to go. Like from a roll up, are you starting? And so I'm wondering, do you have some that are in place that could be used? And then like templates, because for me, this has really been a difficult task to narrow down. Because I might try to get in touch with somebody four or five times, either by text or voicemail. And then I just, you know, give up. They didn't call back. So I have one of mine only, but it's been like two years I've been paying for it, and I haven't been able to do it. Well, there is now a new version of PC Recruiter that you can add to your database that will allow you to build. There's a kind of a pre-designed sales pipeline already built in there. It looks and works similar to the position pipeline, the interview pipeline, but it's sales related. So it allows you to, rather than put a name into the pipeline for a position, you put a company into the pipeline to track them through the sales process. Okay. And where would I find – how would I upload that new version? Well, it's actually an upgraded piece. It's adding a whole separate interface to your database. It is something – let's see. Oh, you're already on premium, which is good. So it would only be $10 more per month than a $350 setup. So you'd have $350 would include creating the new link and four hours training. And what it would do, it would create a new and different link to your same existing database. So you'd have this new link in this different format that would add the sales pipeline functionality and a whole new interface. So pretty much everything from PC Recruiter is going to be in there anyway. and it would show you kind of, it's just a different way of accessing your same database. And you could still go back to using your existing PC recruiter version if you wanted, or you could start using PCRM entirely. There's no problem there. If there's somebody that I could go, you know, could give me a training and so I could try it? Because I find myself having a very difficult time searching with PC recruiters Because sometimes, you know, like it may not have picked up a zip code or sometimes it doesn't fill in a specific geography. So it's hard. I find it harder to search in a geography. Yeah, well, what we could do, I could show you a demo of it if you'd like. and I'm only in half a day today and then I'm out all next week on vacation. So I don't have a whole lot of time right now. But if I could connect with you maybe that week of August 4th, the week after next, we could set up a time to maybe spend 30 minutes showing you the new PCRM product, show you how it searches, answer any questions about your existing product, searching, whatnot. And I could show you around and then see if you want to give it a try. So when can you set something up? I will be back on the week of August 4th And I could actually even schedule something for you that week if you'd like. Okay, that would be great. Let me pull up my calendar. Sure. Okay. Okay. Let me see what this says. Let me check it. okay what time i could do maybe 10 a.m or 11 a.m what's best for you that day i'm pretty open so far you're you're not uh you're on east coast time right yeah oh yeah how about 10 perfect 10 a.m and what are you can you send me a calendar invite i will and i have two i have two email addresses for you. Which is the appropriate? I have Linda at medicalrecruiters.com and Linda at BaileySearchandAssociates.com. Linda at medicalrecruiters.com. Medical Recruiters. Perfect. I will email you a Zoom and an invite for the 5th at 10 a.m. And we can hop on, take a look then. I'll show you the PCRM. And I'll also kind of help you with some searching questions if you have any of those. Great. And that'll have a new, that'll have a new, what do you call it, sequence in it? Yeah, there's a new sequencing tool. Yes. Okay, great. All right, that would be wonderful. Sure, very well. And I'm going to get my question because I have some questions on how to fix a couple things in my database anyway. Sure, I can help with that. Or if it's over my head, I could put in a ticket and get you to someone who can't, but I should be able to help with most anything. All right. All right, thank you. Have a great vacation. Thank you. Have a great day. We'll talk to you in about a week and a half. Sounds good. Bye. Take care. Bye. You too. Bye-bye.",
