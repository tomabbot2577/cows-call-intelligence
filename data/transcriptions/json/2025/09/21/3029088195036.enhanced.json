    "text": " Hello, this is Bonnie. Hi, Bonnie. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hi. He's your recruiter. I am so sorry. I think I might have overlooked a voicemail from you, and I don't think you got a call back. I did not, but that's okay. I apologize for that. That's okay. I'm glad you called. What I am struggling with is being able to enter current employment under the names of my candidates. Okay. Are you referring to the history section? So I have my database set up under the candidates' names. I have name, address, contact info, education, salary, and then current employment. But when I go under current employment, it just says default for candidate. Oh, okay. And I'm not able to put their current employer in there. Okay. So what it sounds like to me is that you might – who set that up for you? Do you remember? I don't remember. Okay. Okay. so what it sounds like is you have um the person in the default company and that is basically just a read only of what company record they are in so you would need to change so it's not like a field that you can just type in it's actually the record that they're associated with um is that how you intended it to be? No. Okay. So let me see. Where do you have that? Okay. Let me go in. What is your username? It's executiveag. Oh, your username. It looks like it's just Bonnie, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it is Bonnie. All right, let me see what's in your name layout. Okay, so the current employment, that is all related to what company record they're in. So, for example, if you look at Chris Thompson, right next to his name, the company record that he's associated with is your default company. Now, how did you bring this person in? Was it through portal or capture? I'm sorry, capture, I mean. Capture, PC Capture. So it sounds like to me you might have your PCR capture set where it puts them into the default and instead of trying to get a company record for them. So if you click directly on your PCR capture extension at the top right of your browser, let me know when you see that. It's the purple, green, blue option. Okay. Okay. it pops up a menu like what sites we would be using it on but see at the bottom right where it says capture to default company uh yes okay is that blue like it's on or gray and over to the left as if it's off it's on okay if you turn that off what that'll do is when you're using capture it'll try based on their profile try to create a company record or if it finds a match you would hover on the possible match and then select the check box so that they go into the existing record instead of creating as new so these people because some people don't want like companies just because somebody worked there so this would be creating the way you had it before is it's just putting everybody into the default which is basically a fake company record okay so i i manually enter a lot of people and it won't let me enter a company name right because that's related to a record it's not just a free type field it's actually the record that they're in okay like if you go to name and go to search as an example. Okay. Without any criteria, you'll notice every name is in a company record. So when you don't know what company they work for or really care, you would just add the, you would, or if you don't select, let's say if you're parsing a resume, they would just go into the default company. So the default company is really a company record with a fake name that just kind of, so we can't have any orphaned records. Everybody must be in a company. So that's just kind of like a little catch-all so we don't have any orphaned name records. Okay. So you can't just put somebody into the default. What would be the benefit of doing that? Because it's a database requirement. So some people, they don't want to create company records just because somebody worked there. So they would just put somebody into the default. I see. So all of these fields were set for employment. So if I don't know their company? Yeah, so if you didn't know the company, then you would add them to the default. Otherwise, you would need to have a company record. So you can either put the name of their company or you put default for candidates? Well, if you are parsing a resume, you could either pick an existing company record. if you don't do that then it would just go into the default company because not all of our customers want like you know John Smith works for XYZ company if you're never going to call that person you just put them into the default okay the current employment section it's not stuff that you're free typing it's really carrying over from the company oh so I can't Even if I make this change, I can't enter the name of their company. You would have to have a record for it. And then what you do, let's say Chris Thompson, let me find the name of one of your companies. Let's say Chris Thompson worked for XYZ company. Right now, he's in the default. If you're on his name record, there's a change company option at the top right of his record. It looks like a little office building. Do you see that? it looks like in your setup it's between your link to position and your upload photo option um okay yes i see it okay so if you if he's let's say you find out chris thompson oh he isn't a he now works for a company that's in my database so it does have to be a record first if you're if you have an existing record, what you would do is click on Change Company and then pick the company record that you want to move them to. Oh, okay. Okay. Now, in this case, for Chris... And if there isn't one, can you just add one? No, you'd have to have the company record exist first. Now, if you use PCR Capture, like let's say you went to... Do you mind if I make one layout change for you? no that'd be fine okay if it makes sense this might help you a little bit hold on one second here can you hear me okay now yes okay my headset it just kind of went to one side I just want to make sure okay hear me okay so let me see something here um where would we maybe put that okay let's go I'm gonna put it in your layout. I like to see it. My eyes are getting old. And I'm like, okay, looking at the things are, you know, green over at the sidebar. Okay. So let's say you went to, if you can pull up Chris Thompson again, just use him as an example. And you changed that one setting I mentioned, right? I did that, but I captured a default. It should be off, right? Right. Yeah. Turn that off and then close that window. Okay, perfect. So if you pull up Chris Thompson again, under contact information, I added a field for you so it's easier to see if you have it populated rather than looking in that area at the left if it's green. If you click on that LinkedIn icon to the right of that field, it'll take you to his profile. Okay, got it. now your PCR capture option should pop up and because it's going to recognize them it's going to say click to update okay okay hit it go ahead and click that now because he exists you're going to click on his name to say yes this is the right one because you could have a high-tech Thompson's in your database but you got to pick which one okay and then down at the bottom it's going to give you options to put him into the default or use his current company those those little toggles so right now he's in the default but that's not where we want him okay now down at the bottom do you have any potential matches based on what's his company central my home okay so don't select the use his existing company or the um and don't use the default. Just advance over to your next screen. So if you hit review. Okay. So up at the top you're going to be updating the existing record but see now the purple says new company. Review new company. Yes. Okay. So you can update him but actually create a company record this time. So if you hit submit. okay now when you go back to your database and you pull up chris thompson he will be in a company record now based on what was in his profile oh okay so i think it was just the setting that you had so if you haven't done too many lately this might be you know a good way to get that cleaned up. Now one thing that's very important, let's go to Chris's LinkedIn profile again. Okay. And this time, now you might say add or update. That's just based on the person. So because it's Chris again, we're going to see it as click to update. All right. Okay. Now this time, you're going to see where it has a potential match. at the bottom for the company. If you hover on that card, just click the checkbox. Once you hover on it, you want to select him. I'm sorry, let me clarify. In the green section where it says the name, that's all related to the person. The lower half is all related to the company. We want to click on the existing Chris Thompson because it is the same person, but we don't want to be creating another new company. So when you hover on that card, if that company is already in your database and that's the company you want him in, you would hover on the card and hit the checkbox. Okay. Okay. Now, a couple other situations. So that way when you advance, you're not creating a new company and you run and watch that banner. It'll say new company or selected company or forget how it's worded. It'll just say person being added to. Now, here's the little tricky part, though. What's really more current? What's on his profile or what's in his database? So let's say if you look at where it has like the potential duplicate of him and it'll list like what his title and his current company is in your database, that will be within that green name section. Let's say, you know, I have him in my database where he should be. but okay he's really bad about updating his profile and he's changed jobs but he never updated his LinkedIn profile that's where the um use Chris's company is helpful meaning keep him in the company record I have him in PCR regardless of what it lists on his profile because sometimes people are just you know LinkedIn isn't their priority and they don't update it true so I know it's confusing but there's a lot of what-if situations as I always tell people okay got it well that helps a lot well thank you so much I appreciate you are welcome so some of those other ones I think might be easier rather than creating a company and then using change company from the records is maybe if you just go back to the profile okay and then just use that update just keep in mind you know watch when you advance to that final screen before you hit submit that am Am I creating a new one? Am I selecting an existing? Because you don't want people going into the wrong company or getting duplicates. Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, thank you for your help. You are welcome. And I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. I think it was a little crazy of a week because so many people were out in July for vacations, and I think everyone's trying to get back to work now. Got lost in the shuffle? It's okay. It got lost in the shuffle. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. That's all right. Thanks. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
