    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Chuck Andrews. How are you today? Good. How are you? I'm well, thanks. I had a computer outage, you know, power-related, and when I got everything back, my, the, oh, was it capture? It's not working properly, okay? It's just a little glitchy. The little icon comes up, and I can click on it, And it will load from, you know, it'll load from LinkedIn into the system. But what it used to do is once a name was loaded, if I clicked on it again, it would show me, you know, I could update, right? But this just loads it again. Yeah. Oh, okay. I don't know. It's just glitchy. If you could just talk me through getting things set the way they should be, that would be great. Sure. Sure. Let's check this setting first. So at the top right of the browser where you have that little PCR capture icon in purple, it should open up your capture menu if you click on that. Down at the bottom right, do you have basic mode turned off to the left or on to the right? Wait a minute. You're talking about when I'm in LinkedIn? Anywhere. You could be on any page in your browser. You should have that little PCR capture logo at the top right of the browser. Yeah, I'm not seeing it actually. Okay, do you have the little white puzzle piece icon? I do. Okay, click on that and then you can pin the PCR capture tool so that it appears up to the left of that puzzle piece. I just did it. Okay, there we go. Excellent. So then yeah, go ahead and click on that and it should open the capture menu where it lists the different websites like LinkedIn, Indeed. at the bottom right it says basic mode that should be off and to the left is that off currently no it was on okay I think that's the problem if you turn that off into the left and then try to capture somebody it will let you look over the information before it goes in okay okay so let me lock so I log off of that capture thing or no just no just click the X at the top right to close the menu and then go back to LinkedIn if you have a LinkedIn profile still pulled up just hit refresh on it to take on the new settings we just put into the capture tool refresh let's see here and you can to refresh you could just go to the it's like an arrow in a loop yeah Yeah, yeah, I just did it. Okay, so there's click for an update. There we go. That's what I wanted. Okay. Excellent. Now, do you know anything about the Zoom info stuff at all as far as, because I've got a little plug-in for that too, but it's not working properly either. You don't know anything about that, do you? Yeah, nothing about that, unfortunately. Is it, I wonder if it just needs an update possibly? I'm not sure with the Zoom info on. Well, let me look at the puzzle piece again and go to manage extensions, I guess, right? And there's Zoom info. So, this extension cannot read or change the site information or run in the background. If I put it on, okay, I just had a little, yeah, it was the same kind of thing, a little button there. Okay. I think I may have just fixed it. All right, man. I appreciate your help. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. I appreciate it. Take care. Bye. Bye.",
