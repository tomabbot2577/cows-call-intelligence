    "text": " Thank you for calling me in Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Zach at Precise Resource. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. I think I spoke with you before, like last week, I believe. Yeah. Okay. So I left you a message and sent you an email. I got slammed with work, so I don't know if I missed it. But I was wondering, can I schedule a meeting, screen share, learning session? the opportunity something with you guys so typically with those like as long as if it's like a half hour we can just hop on if you have a few questions we can go through and ask and schedule something anything longer than that would require the purchase of additional training hours but yeah we can definitely get something on the books if you want to do like like a half hour meeting just go over a couple things that would be great what what i have a problem with is when i run reports, like pipeline reports, the system spits it out in the most confusing stupidly way possible. And I was wondering if I could change that somehow, make it a little bit more easier to read. Yeah, so what we can do, there are some custom reports that we can do, or there's just different ways that you can export them. Yeah, let's give the time on the books and we can kind of go over the different options there and i can kind of show you some examples um to do i got a few things on the books for today already what what is your day looking like tomorrow tomorrow afternoon would be good all right i'm i am available anytime from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern. Is that the time in there that works best for you? Yeah, how about let's do 3 o'clock. Alright, so let me grab your email here. Two seconds. And what's a good email for you? It is zmitchell, that has two L's in it, at preciseresource.com. Perfect. So we'll do tomorrow, 3 p.m. So I'm going to send you a link for the screen share. Perfect. and it was Z Mitchell yep perfect alright I just sent that on over to you awesome so yeah just and even if you have like a little bit of a list of stuff you uncover just email it over to me just make it a little easier that way we make sure we have time to cover everything okay sounds good wonderful thank you so much yep not a problem if you have any questions in the meantime just let me know will do have a good one",
