    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yeah, hi, Robin. This is Ken Burnett. We've spoken several times. How are you? I'm good. Listen, the reason I'm calling you is I've talked to a number of people at PCR, and you seem to be the most knowledgeable. Oh, I wouldn't say that, but go ahead. Thanks. Okay. Well, for so much better. Well, here's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to set up a sequence for a year for business development and what I'd like to do is set it up by quarter you know three months three months three months and to you know reach out to people hopefully I talk to them if I do or if I don't you know they then go into the next three months. And in between, I would send out emails and follow up stuff like that. And what I've gone through the, you know, the sequence to what you'd sent me a while ago on setting it up. Do you have any suggestions or how I should go about doing this? well here's my thing i don't like doing long-term stuff in the same sequence only because if you don't know what everything that you're about to do if you get something that hits or gets where they get into um a point where they would get queued up it's already ended there's no way to like kind of like restart that step do you know what i mean So it might almost be better that once they go through the steps, then 90 days later or whatever, they go into another sequence. To me, I think that's a little safer. Okay. Because you may not know what you want to do. You know, if you're doing like every, you know, three months or whatever, you may not know what you want to do six months, nine months. But if somebody already gets queued up for that step, then it can mess things up. Like if it's already, well, then they're going to complete it. It might just be better that for those three months they go through their steps and then at their last step or whatever it is, that maybe it adds them to another roll-up that you would, when you're ready, activate that for that roll-up. That might be a safer option. All right. Does that make sense at all? Well, it does. that's why I'm reaching out. I'm just trying to figure out the best way to do this. Yeah. Because I had somebody like they wanted to do like, well, I want to email them every month and they're trying to do like one sequence and like the person was just like picking the same form letter. I'm like, well, you can't do that. And then like if you don't get that letter in before somebody's queued up or at that step, like it's going to be a problem. Yeah, I do have another platform I use for emailing you know, mass emails. You know, I send out NPC emails and I have something else I use for that because that is mass. I mean, you can even just do it like you do, like a mail campaign, like you do it a sequence that wants the email sent or something like that. Well, what I would do is... And it just puts it into a roll-up list at the end. And then when they get to that other roll-up, when you're ready to start the next round, just use that roll-up for a new sequence. Yeah, okay, that might be. Yeah, as far as the emails to them, they're not going to be bulk. They're just going to be, you know, I called somebody today. I'll send them an email. And, you know, then I'll call somebody else, send them an email. And I would do the emails. So they're manual emails, not automatic. Well, that one might not be too bad then. Yeah, I'm going to do a manual. you know I'll have I'll put a step in there just to remind me to send an email but then I will you know manually I'll have a template made of the email I want to send and I'll just send it manually because I may talk to the person and if I talk to the person I don't necessarily want to send them an email saying hey I just left you a voice message yeah I mean in that case it might be a little bit safer you just got to remember before some like let's say you did four steps for now um and then you had it like once they do the last one it completes their sequence well if they get there before you put in that fifth step so yeah well as long as it's manual i think you'll be better off you should be fine yeah because some of the people you know let's just say january i start january i talk to some people well i've already talked to them and it may go somewhere, it may go somewhere else, the conversation. They may have the need, so I talk to them some more. Could you hold on a second? Sure. If I lose you, I'll call you back. Hello? Yes. Oh, okay. Hey, it worked. I lose people frequently. okay yeah so all right so the way if i understand so set up a sequence you know i'll call let's just say i talk to that person i can then hit connected and then that would send them to a roll-up which would be the next um quarter that i'll be be sending or they'll already be there but I may need to follow up with them or schedule something else and I could do that and do that separately out of the sequence. Yeah, or I mean because it's a manual email, it might be a little bit safer you just keep adding more and more steps but then it's like – because the other thing that goes on with that too is like well if you put somebody in your roll-up, like your step one may – like let's say if you're going to use a form letter, it's just you might always have people behind rather than having it in a roll-up knowing that these are going to be August to September. I'm just trying to set something up just to remind me to stay in touch with these people. That's really what I'm trying to do. A number of the coaches I talk to, they say, you set it up. You reach out at least once a quarter to people. I just need to remind myself because I get busy doing other things. Oh, no, I got to just to call this person. That's really what I'm trying to do. Yeah. If you want to think about it, we could talk later. That's fine, too. I mean, some people just go into a roll up and like they just have everybody they'd want to reach out to and they just kind of work through a roll up once a month. Well, that's what I have. I have a huge roll up of a thousand people. OK. Yeah. I mean, you could just go to the roll up and just do it as a mail campaign, like a one time mail campaign each month. Well, I'm not going to mail. That would be if it's a mail campaign. But if you're going to do individuals, then either call from the list or just do a sequence on it. Yeah, I have something else set up for mailing. They go through a series of business development emails. And once they're done with that, they go into another top of mind email sequence where once a month I send out an email. That's set up. So that's not in PCR. That's a different platform I use just because of the problems with mass emails these days. Microsoft doesn't let you do anything. Gmail doesn't let you do much either. They don't want to be spammers. No, well, that's why I have, I mean, this other platform, I have 15 email addresses. Each one set up to send out 20 emails a day, which keeps me below the radar of spammer. They also have a feature called Spintext, which rearranges some of the emails. So it's not the same words going out day in and day out to all these people. It's gotten – yeah, well, it's gotten – and also there's another thing I use where I write an email, and then what's it called? it's called spam checker so I take the email and I put it in there and it gives me a readout of what words I may want to change you know what's one of the things I found from doing that and talk to some other email people well sales I don't want to use sales I don't want to use the symbol percent I want to spell it out and then and then I take that email and I go to chat GPT and I give it certain prompts and then it refinds the email for me and then I stick it back into the checker and it comes back good. I know it's good and that's what I run with. It's gotten that complicated. That's why I keep it out of my email. I know a lot of my friends are like, where's the email I just sent? It's over here because it has these kind of words in it. The word opportunities is definitely a big one. Opportunity sales. There's so many words. and this just checks them for me and tells me I'm good to go, and that's what I use. So it's come – I mean, a year ago it was much simpler. Yes. Well, long gone are the days of blasting your entire database. Yep. I'm taking the first step. Even my phone number these days. I had some people, when I was calling people on the phone, it was coming up as potential spam. So I got to register that. Yeah. It's getting tough. It's getting tough. Oh, I remember I was talking to somebody in Canada several years ago, and they're like, what's PCR going to do about this? We're not going to be able to email anybody or we have any kind of contact with them until we have their permission. I was like, what? How are you going to? that's kind of bad for business no no it's like you can't even email them until you get their permission oh that's great that's ridiculous it's uh called gdpr it's a feature we only give it to the um an international person upon request but yeah they actually have to have somewhere where they like opt in to get an email and until they do they are they it'll block them from being emailed. Horrible. Who thought of that idea? I know. I know part of it, talking with Brian Denton at Sanford Rose, he said one of the problems Microsoft saw is they were having these people just blasting out 40,000 emails at a clip. That was choking their system. That's one reason why they do it. I had two people upset with me today when was today when earlier today when was yesterday you know pcr and yelling about like it's not pc recruiter it's the office 365 or the gmail restriction like you could look at something like sungrid as an alternate mail server that when you're doing high volumes like it's not us doing it it's just we don't send your emails um yeah we're connecting to your own mail server and if your mail server has you know those tight restrictions that's what's happening because they're trying to you know go to a world of 4 000 people and you know yeah that's tough well even one of the problems like i saw with send grid is a lot of the uh receiving servers see that as a third party sender and they just block that you know because i saw yeah i mean i know open rates are always you know you take them with a grain of salt but i saw once i started using send grid for certain things the open rates just dropped in half. And so that's when I started using this other platform. And that's what I had to do. 15 email addresses, 20 a day. You know, it's 300 a day. That works. And I can up it to, and once I let that run for a couple months, I can then up it to like 25 a day. But that's what you got to do. All right. So set it up. So set it up. And then if I connect, I can set a command. So if I connect with somebody, it would send them to another roll-up, which would be my second quarter roll-up. Right. And then if they get through this. Like your first step could be like call. And then that could be like manual email. And then like, you know, one send, you know, goes to the third step. And with that step type would be add to roll up. Right. But what if what if I connect with. Well, because I connected with them, I'd hit connect and it would bypass the first email and go right to the next roll up. Then you could say, like, let's say it's step three. If your final step is adding it to a roll up, you would say your condition would be connected or, you know, whatever you however you want to label it. And you would just say jump to step and then whatever that step final step number is. Right, and the final step would be go to another roll-up. Correct. Okay, I could figure that out. All right, that's helpful. Let me work on that. Okay, thanks. No problem. Have a good day. You too.",
