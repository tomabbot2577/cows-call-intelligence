    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Tali. I'm a PC recruiter user. And I don't see the AI search option. I was just looking at it a little bit. So that feature we couldn't automatically give to people because it requires a, like over the years, there's been different indexing types. There's keyword version one, two, and then Lucene. And for the AI, the database has to be on Lucene. so what I can do is first check your database what is I'm sorry what is your company name it's comprehensive hire Inc doing businesses red seat okay tally flora okay all right let me just check this here for you And you only have the one database, okay. Oh, wow, you're on keyword version one. That's really old. Okay. So you really need an upgrade. You can't even, like, keyword version one is, like, really old. like that one doesn't even support boolean so you're really going to love getting an indexed keyword version too okay so here's what i'm going to do for you i'm going to create a ticket okay so let's see okay one moment while i get this going for you okay and your email is tally at red seat calm still is that still correct tally at red seat calm correct okay perfect okay so we've seen is just kind of like the name of the search method so we would have to do. Okay, let's see. Sign this over. Okay. Okay. So what I'm going to do first of all is I'm going to send, I created the ticket. Okay. And then I'm going to reply back with some things that you'll notice about the Lucene search. Just because when they kick off the index, it'll change, like, how you do keyword searching and how results display. It's actually going to be so much better. Like right now, your search is really like pluses and minuses. So this is going to be so much better for you. Okay. And it'll also be a lot faster. Yeah, it's going to be a lot faster, too, for you. Okay, so I created the ticket. So I have it, the AI search enabled. You'd have to log out and then go back in, but it's not going to work yet until we reindex this database. So once that process completes, then you'd have to log out. Well, no, you should be fine. Once that completes, I just don't know how long it takes. usually depends on the size of the database but with it certainly within 24 hours we'll have that done for you and then so I created the ticket you probably just saw an email come in and then I replied to it as well just some information about the AI searching okay yep I see that or not AI about just the general searching with Lucene like especially when it comes to keywords that's going to be different okay sometimes that keyword table is super helpful like you're looking for the exact word or a keyword where it starts with finding a phrase so if you're used to boolean like I pretty much search most sites anymore this is how you'll want to search it says like the pluses and minuses with keyword version one and it's also gonna be much faster for you too yeah oh that's awesome yeah I'm super looking forward to trying it yeah the old version is not very helpful so yeah so and with this like your database would stay with this Lucene index like that'll be automatic like that's not a trial we'll just upgrade you on that okay but then the AI search would be a trial okay and then you know when the trial ends I have not heard of a date yet I think it's kind of open right now because we're still trying to get the message out so we don't want to do like a cutoff just yet Okay, yeah, well, it's kind of open at this point. Yeah, I haven't decided. I think they're waiting for some feedback. And one thing to keep in mind with the AI search, when you do go to use it, AI is not like we're used to with ChatGPT. like when it comes to searching, it actually has to be trained. So if you're not getting, like if you put in something, you don't get the results you expect, you can either thumbs up or thumbs down. All of that is sent back to our development team, which is reviewed to keep collecting feedback on how it can be improved. Okay. So any AI searching is always a work in progress. It's just check, be GBTs. It's a huge company. I mean, yeah, they've got, gosh knows what they're pulling from the train there. So, you know, it is a little bit different, but, you know, with each piece of feedback we get, it's going to get better and better. Perfect. Well, thank you. All right. No problem. So as soon as that kicks off, it's usually, I would just say maybe try checking tomorrow. Yeah, I'll make a note on my calendar to remind myself to pop in and check it. Okay. So the ticket's been created. I sent you information on Lucene. I actually have a webinar just on searching in general. It doesn't cover the AI search, but since it might be so different for you, it might be not a bad idea to watch it. It's a webinar that I did a while back, but people found it super helpful. Okay. Can you send me the link to that? Yeah. Okay. Let me get that for you. It was this one. And it is me fumbling over my words, just as you probably hear me saying now. But let's see. This is the recorded webinar. I'm searching. Okay. All right, so I sent that over to you, too. And what's nice about watching that is you can pause, go back as needed. Mm-hmm. So that will be super helpful, too. Okay. All right, I will look through that. Thank you. Okay. You are welcome. And then if you have any questions, just reply back to the ticket that we created. and it alerts the person that's currently assigned to. Okay, awesome. Okay, have a great day. Thank you. All right, thanks. Bye-bye.",
