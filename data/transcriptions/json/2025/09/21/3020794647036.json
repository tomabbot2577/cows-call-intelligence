    "text": " Thank you for calling CFC. This is Danielle speaking. How may I help you? Hi, Danielle. I did not mean to call you Cindy. Oh, no worries. How did you send that message? I'm just curious. If this is like our help desk system where maybe we had a different name or how you sent the message that maybe we have to fix your display name. So there have actually been a variety of different people who have sat in that seat. I'm surprised it didn't say Billy. I'm surprised it said Cindy. Sometimes that name pops up. Sometimes Billy pops up. I get called a lot of things. I'm not worried about it. Is it just when it's with us, though? No, no. Okay. Whatever reason, that email address just has weird, has like the last couple of names like ghosted onto it, I guess. Well, we do have a, you know what, this might be us. Okay. Because it does say Cindy Duffy. That's what I, I'm just going to change this to your name. She was the bookkeeper here a long, long time ago, probably about seven years ago when I first started. And then Mary DeLuca was for a while, and then Billy's been in it off and on because she still works here and she does it sometimes. But right now it's both of me. All right. So in case it was our help desk, that gender and display name, because we do have that email address in our help desk, that way I'm going to change that to you. That has nothing to do with the billing. These are all different sites, which is why I think it's so darn confusing. Okay. All right. So that is now going to reflect your name. Excellent. Let me make sure. Oh, no, I've got to change it down here too. Okay. Danielle. And then save. Okay. All right, we've got it at least tied to you. If it was, the help desk doing it. Okay, perfect. Okay, so going back, I sent a flood of emails, and I'm really sorry about the bad email. I don't know what happened there. Did I work with you guys at some point? So the problem is. I couldn't tell you. Chris honestly has been, I don't know how long this transition has been going on. Chris told me about it about two days ago, and then I got that email sent to me, and he didn't give me instructions on it. So I was like, I guess he's handling it. This is for my information. And then he was like, oh, I think that they're actually like you need to go in and do something. And that's when I responded to the email and was like, hey. I went in, logged in, made an account. I think I've got everything paid for. I got receipts for all those different invoices. So I believe everything should be good. Is there anything else that you need from me going forward? Let me see, because I wanted to tell you about the customer portal where you can actually go in and see your invoices and everything. Yes, I think I did that. Okay. Oh, and you even did this. Okay, because that one I backed. Okay, so that one, ABL. so then the upgrade invoice is paid as well okay so I'm going to get that upgrade moving forward and I did update the address I think all of our systems are separate you're at Discovery Boulevard now right yes that's correct okay so all of those at least the open ones I think I only bothered with the open ones I updated those but I also set your recurring and your customer account to all have the new address so we should be good and I apologize for this again when you work different systems actually so let me make sure what we have over here for you and we also maintain PC recruiter for just like when you guys call in and that stuff let me see what we got over there for you guys Help me, APL factoring, did I update it yet over here? Discovery Boulevard, okay, yeah, I did do that one too. Okay, so we have it, everything all updated now. And we should be good. Okay, I'm going to make sure I have your email address over here. I set up the auto pay as well, so hopefully, although it says it must be accepted by the same person on this, so I guess Chris needs to accept the auto pay. Oh, how did you create the account? I created it with my email address, the ACCT one. I wonder if it has to match the name that we do it, or does it want the name of your card? What's the name on the card? It's probably going to be Chris's written name. Okay. So that did not accept his name either. OK, I wonder if I have to have a name. OK, let me try this. I'm going to just put his name even though it's account, that email address. I'm going to put his name. Maybe it wants to, because your first name and last name are blank. So let me try adding something in there on the customer account. This system is a little different, so it's still working out different things. Try typing Chris Raines now. That did not work either. I'm wondering if where I put name, I put like you gave the card a name, maybe that's what it's meaning. It could be the card name. All right. Let's try that then. It might be one of those things that wants zip code to verify. No, it's not accepting that either. Okay. I could probably do it. I wonder if it wants David's name. No, because I don't have David's name associated with the building at all. It's either a card or the account. So let me see. Let's say customer. Okay, so I'm going to put your name. Autopay. Oh, you have it on. Oh, it's already on. Maybe that's why it's not letting me. Okay, I thought I had turned it on and then. Okay, yeah, it's saying on in 1004. That's correct, yes. Okay, yeah, it's showing it's on. And then the other thing is over at the vault area at the right in that customer portal. Did you go in and you created an account for the customer portal, right? or no um i believe that's what i'm at i have like invoices history profile involved all at the top okay perfect yes so at the left under invoices that's where you can see your history you can even go and print an invoice if you wanted to your all of your historical stuff won't be there because that was all from the old system and be like years and years stuff um but over at the right under vault if you ever want to change your card you no longer have to you know chase one of us down and fill out some old like word form to send your card information you just very archaic right um if you go over to the right under vault you can add a new card and then once you have that card set up you can turn off auto pay on the other one delete it and then enable auto pay for the new one okay okay so you can kind of manage all that which is going to be so much nicer for you guys too. Plus, if there's ever an issue, this new system, like, it should alert you as well, if, as long as it's a good email draft now. Let's say, for some reason, if it wasn't on auto-pay or something that, you know, it's running late or, you know, things like that, like, remains unpaid. So, it's a lot more automated, which is nice. Nice. Yes. That'll be good. All right. So I think we're all set. I will tag in the ticket that the invoice for the upgrade is done, so they will move forward with that. That was, let's see, where's that ticket? because, um, let's see, where's that ticket? That's not Chris's name, right? No, I can just do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And this is going to Jim Lombardo. So what I did for you, I think, I don't know if you read in the other emails that I sent, says you're really just getting started with the, you're not really getting started just yet, and the dates are so close that June invoice, I'm sorry, July invoice, July 17th. Let me refresh this because I just did it. I'm going to try and create it one. It doesn't automatically refresh. For the July one, what I did is I kept it at your normal rate that you've been at, but then your next invoice will be at the upgrade rate. But both the July and the August are going to be three users. Okay. Okay. So we should be good there. So your next one would be 210. And that is scheduled for August 17th. Perfect. Okay. Yeah. There's like the crossing dates. They're just like so close. So, but we're all good. And I will let Jim know that these are now paid. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you so much. Have a good week. Or weekend. Alrighty. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
