    "text": " Hi. I'm so sorry. I am a new employee of CWP Technical, and I'm trying to log into PCR Recruiter. and while I have my username and my password and obviously the database drop down, every time I log into it, it's a different screenshot than what I was shown it should look like, but also it's saying that I'm having invalid credentials. So I was wondering if maybe something timed out or if I need to change something or... Yeah, I'll take a look. What's your name? My name is Ashley McCarthy. Okay, let me just open up the CW Technical database and look for that. These are associated with your name. One second. Okay, so your database CW Technical group is the only one in the option, so that's good. Your username is Ashley, so it's not like an email address or anything. Right, and it's all capital, is that correct? Correct, yeah. Username is always going to be capitalized. Password is case-sensitive though, so I am going to check to make sure that your username isn't like locked from too many password attempts or something one second okay because this is like the third time I've tried it so but the password that I have can I just read it off to you like so you know I'm not crazy so I don't I don't have any way to verify passwords we don't have any access to users passwords but if you are entering in Ashley is the username it might be that you have the wrong password supplied to you by the system administrator. Or maybe check if the caps lock was on or things are capitalized correctly when you're entering it. But, yeah, if that still doesn't work, you can message your system administrator and let them know that you need a new password because that one isn't working, or maybe they can give you an updated version of that password. I'm not sure. Okay, so then my system administrator, would that be through the help desk or the learning center or? That would be the, sorry, that's the person on your team that set up your username in your database for you. So maybe your supervisor or someone else on your team. Got it, okay. Yeah, so it might just be a wrong password that they gave you. If you do have trouble or maybe your system administrator doesn't know how to change your password, you can have them reach out and call in. We can walk them through that, no problem. Okay, and then, so therefore I can't download the Chrome extension or anything like that until I get this all squared away, is that correct? Oh, right. Yeah. The Chrome extension is going to have you log in as well. And it'll require your username and password. Yep. OK. All right. And then if it says sign in with my Google account, but I don't have a Google account, I'm just using my CWP email. Would you say that's correct? Oh, okay. You might be on the wrong screen then if there is an option to log in with Gmail. Okay. So let's take a look at that. So your web address up above, does it say www.pcrecruiter.net and then kind of end or somewhere in the middle, does it say CWP Technical Group in the web address? Yeah, it says www.pcrecruiter.net backslash blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. and then it says CWP technical group ampersand style sheet equals dark gray ampersand theme size equals large. Gotcha. Yeah, I think you're in the right place then. So you are seeing an option to log in with Google there? Towards the – where did it go? I did. Yeah, once I type in, like, Windows, If I go to Windows, how did I get there? How did I get there? Let me back up. Yeah, towards the, I mean, at one point it says, yes, you can sign in with Windows. And it shows me like a Chrome store. And then it says detail slash error. And then it says this item is not available. But please sign in with you this item. So, but I'm guessing that without having the login validated, it won't let me log in. I see. It might be, yeah, it might be that you have something called the, what is that, the 2FA or two-factor authentication turned on for your username. I could check that. I think that would be the only instance where it would be. Oh, actually, that is not enabled. Huh. Can you just add that Chrome on your computer? It's already downloaded. Yeah. Sorry. I'm also on with my boss. Oh, no worries. Yeah, I'm not sure. It shouldn't on the PCR screen prompt you to log into like Google or Windows or anything. A pop-up might appear if you're trying to use like an autofill pre-saved password. If that's happening, then Windows, your computer itself, might need like a PIN number or something to use an autofill pre-saved password for this website. But that's more like a Windows pre-saved password feature. Okay. So I would just need my admin to kind of call and just verify the password situation? Yeah, they can either change your password. Hello? Sorry, you cut out. Oh, sorry. Yeah, you can either have the admin change your password and give it to you so you can try entering that, or they can give us a call if they're having trouble changing your password. Okay. Does it have to be a certain amount of characters or numbers or special characters? I think it has to be like eight. It'll have something on the screen that lets you know if it wasn't like correctly entered. Okay. Okay. That's totally great. Okay. Well, then I will let them know. And then if we have any questions, I will give you a call back. That sounds great. All right. All right. Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye.",
