    "text": " Hello. Hello, Haas. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Jim, I'm doing good. How's it going, sir? Not too bad. Not too bad. Wanted to give a call. I just got a notice here your training ticket hadn't had any activity on it in a little while, so I wanted to circle back, make sure everything was going okay with PC Recruiter, see if you had any questions, or see if you need any more training or what. Yeah. No, I do actually need you still to connect with Christian for the same training session we've tried to set up a couple times. Okay. But, yeah, that's about it. I probably could just reply back to those emails. I saw them come through a week or two ago here. Yeah, they just close it after a little while. They close the ticket if you don't hear back. But, yeah, just respond, and they can get that set up. I'll note the ticket that we spoke, and you are looking to get something set up still, but just reach out when you're ready. Excellent. Did you guys end up selling the business? No, we're still plugging along and just making go as we are. I love it. Okay. All right. All right. Well, yeah, I appreciate it. I'll reply back to those emails, man, and make sure that Christian gets on it. Fantastic. All right. Very well. Anything you need ever, just let me know. No problem, man. I'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Okay. You take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
