    "text": " Hello. Hey, Robin. Yes. Hi, this is Bill Hayes. Okay, I figured you'd know the number by now. Yeah, it took me that long for my system to reboot and go through its whole process again and blah, blah, blah. Anyway, so I went back to the original email you sent me on Outlook to the link to click on it to see if it made a difference, and it did not. it said the same thing that this site is unreachable okay um and by the way while you and i were on the phone tyler was calling me back as well i guess he got must have picked up the message as well well here's what happened the ticket actually assigned to tyler and i didn't have my filter my name off i accidentally grabbed it oh okay that's fine i point you'll be aware of that but you probably knew that yeah um let me hold that one second okay all right Okay, so I'll probably have to do... okay so let's i'm not really sure this would be done okay let's try and you have restarted like your modem and router and all that kind of good stuff right you said you already did that after your other connection issues? Yeah, this morning, I mean, it restarted itself. I mean, it came, you know, I didn't have to do anything. I just had to wait for the connection to take place again via the streaming, you know, service, and then it did that. So, yeah, I mean, I'm getting, I mean, I could click on, I could click on the LinkedIn bookmark and it goes right there. I might have any problems with that. yeah we got a little bit more going on though they may okay let's have you rejoin that meeting okay you want me to go back to that old email or you have to send a new no I think this is the last one I have up so I think we should be good let me go back to that meeting now yeah just hit the join call button again okay trust us trust sender I guess I should Click that. Maybe that's why it wasn't going through. I don't know. Some content as messages has been blocked because the sender isn't in your safe senders list. So maybe that's why it wasn't. I hit trust sender, and now I hit join call. Maybe that was why you weren't getting it. I think I'm going to write one. Okay. I wonder if I am now. I'm going to resend you a link. It's loading. it's loading something up here now. I don't know if you're not... Am I in the same one, though? I had one that was just in. I assume it's yours. Yeah. It says you're getting ready. You'll be able to join in just a moment. We did the camera thing again. All right. Ask to join. Yeah, click that. I think it's the same meeting. Okay, let's turn off microphone for some reason to turn that on. Ready to join, ask to join. Oh, we'll see if I'm going to be in a meeting with you, right? There it goes. Okay. All right. So, yes, we're on the phone, so you can mute your microphone. And then let's have you click share screen. Okay, where is that at? Down at the bottom of the meeting screen. Mm-hmm. So square, like a rectangle with an arrow in it. Oh, there you go. And then you should be popping up a window. It says presentation is starting. There you go. Are you talking? Your mic is off. Click the mic. You said I don't need to turn the mic on? No, you don't need that on. Right. Oh. Okay. Oh, now there's something I wanted to mention to you. I heard something about Google doing some update and moving things into tabs, and I don't really know what that means, but could that maybe be the cause of why it was banned? I'm not sure what you're referring to. I just saw somebody else say on one of the forums that they weren't able to get into a certain place and it turns out Google had moved it to some sort of tab. I don't know. I'd just bring that up if that's... I have no idea what that's referring to. Nothing that you've heard. Okay. Are you talking about that automatic tab discarding feature? Yeah. I mean, again, I'm not 100% sure what that means either. It was just something came up today from some other thing I was reading, and they couldn't get into a site, and it turns out that their bookmark had been moved somewhere. Oh, no. I don't know about that. That just seems like bad saving. So it says here, choose what to share with me. The site will be able to see the content. Do I need to click on something? You need to go to entire screen. Okay. And then click on the screen to show. Click, just click on the, I don't know, to share. What am I doing here? Clicking on this. I hit entire screen. Now, am I supposed to be doing? So you got to click on the screen to show and then hit share. On the screen to show. I'm not seeing that part. So when you clicked on share screen, it popped up a window, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. And you go over to entire screen. Choose what to share. Right. I hit entire screen. and it'll show you like a preview of your monitor and if you have more than one it shows you each one i only have one monitor okay so you click on that monitor and then hit shot it there you go okay sorry i'm a little challenged here um let's do this go to see at the bottom right by your computer I'm sorry by the date and time there's like an arrow that points up click on that over to the left a little bit more oh yeah yeah yeah I got you the one that points out show hidden icons yeah close it shows that uh click that one okay you don't have that in there okay let's um you're right it's not in there pc right to be in there yeah well that's just the launcher tool when it's running. Let's do this. Kind of over to the left a little bit, like in a dead area, right click. So like on the, it's got like a gray background. All right. So get rid of that, this thing, right? We don't want to see this anymore. Now go right click. Yeah. And go to your chat, select, right click there and select task manager. Okay. did that open yet yep just did I'm saying your computer is running slow in general it is I would agree with you 100% on that I think it might be best to restart your computer maybe and run some Windows updates make sure your browser is up to date run your Windows up to date restart your computer also restart your browser I know one of our tech guys said make sure you update Windows because there's something in there that's going to cause an issue, even with like something about JPEG. So I have no idea. Well, I think I'm out of my, at the end, in another month or two, I'm going to be unable to update. I have Windows 10 in this laptop. And I don't know that I can update to 11 based on the capabilities I have in this machine. Yeah. So that's a whole other problem, but that's another month and a half down the road. Go to more details there. Okay. Okay. Okay, Task Manager. Let's scroll down under Background Processes. Let's see if we see anything. CPU disk space is pretty much used up. I'm always cleaning out cache for what that's worth. No, let's see. So Java, TMS, VMI, and NERC. Okay, that's not running at all. Looks like Microsoft edges it. This space is pretty much full. Let's try taking your URL. Take your URL. Try opening it in Edge, and then let's try opening it. I'm sorry, open in Chrome, and then let's try opening up in Edge. Okay, so you want me to go right there? No, no. We've got to get out of the Task Manager screen. Oh, get out of the Task Manager. Yeah. Okay. Then, okay, so we're in Chrome right now. Let's open up a new tab. All right, go down to Edge, which I never really use, by the way. Well, you probably need to get your URL unless you have it saved there. okay type in there it is click on the piece recruiter shortcut in your bookmarks bar yep look on that that'll at least tell us if it's page consistent okay same result I got from Chrome okay let's exit this tab let's go over Chrome for a moment. Okay. Yeah, open up a new tab. Okay. Oh, sorry. My bad. And click on the shortcut for Chrome or for Peace Recruiter. Okay. Click on the little I for information icon your address and reachable I tried that Windows Network diagnostics it didn't it couldn't determine anything go up go up to like the eye to the left of the URL yep go to cookies and go to site settings You see anything there you want to keep scrolling? Let me see. What else? And you said you have not restarted the router and modem, like really like a restart. You just let it reset. No, I didn't unplug it or anything like that. I think we might have to do that, to be honest. Okay. Because even just things that I'm seeing that should be faster, they're slower. Right. Well, I can unplug my routers right next to me. I can unplug it and give it 30 seconds, but that's what you think we should try first? Let's see. The router would just be Wi-Fi, though, right? because it wouldn't be browser if you're getting the same thing on both it would be and i can get to your page so it's got to be something to your network okay i'm going to try to try the unplug the uh the router for starters right yeah i'd probably leave it down for like do both of them do like 30 seconds especially when you power out it is like it could be remembering things about your previous session and that's what's not letting you get there? When you say both of them, I don't know. Do you have a router and a modem? Whatever you have to restart. It kind of depends. Just the router. Because I did a computer restart. Okay. This is a new modem. This is a new router, too. Fairly new. Less than a year. Should I try to plug it back in and see if anything happens? Not yet. wait like 30 seconds okay Okay now? Yeah, try it now. Actually, you know what? Restart your computer too, just to make sure. All right. Let me close that. So we can get out all these windows, I guess, all the settings and stuff? Yeah. You don't need to see the screen anymore? No, not for now. I have a feeling that reset is going to take a while again like I said I don't want to hold you up here I just restarted I didn't completely shut the computer down I could do that too I could just shut it off, wait a minute and then turn it back on I mean, what do you suggest? Yeah, you could try that. Yeah. I mean, because it's not us because, again, I can get your page just no problem, Windows or Chrome. Mm-hmm. And it happened to you in Edge and Chrome, so it's not your browser. Right. Right. And like I said, I was away for five days, and I don't turn it off when I go away. I just leave it in hibernation mode, you know. Okay. actually Rebecca okay continue so we have a little bit more like security things like where you know to make sure people are not logged in indefinitely so it remembers like a session ID and sometimes I can get hung up right yeah I mean I've been guilty of being in the middle of something and then leaving and then not coming back till tomorrow but I know you automatically log it off it says shut down here I have update and shutdown, too. I would probably do that. Yeah, let's do the update and shutdown. It might take a while. All right. Well, let me, let me, I don't, again, I don't want to hold you up. There's not much you can do while this is doing what it has to do, but it sounds like we've done. mostly the logical steps here, right? It's a process of elimination, unfortunately. Right, right. Yeah, like I said, I was in here for five days. I didn't touch a thing, so... And it's set to automatically do updates and downloads, you know, after, you know, 6 o'clock at night when whatever, 9 of the week, so... you don't have to have another computer in your house do you uh i do but it's my wife's and i mean it's downstairs i could it could actually where you were thinking of trying another no i was just trying to see if like if you even went to your pcr link on that computer like right would you get the same thing right and then that can kind of tell you where like Like there's like a, your computer is hung up with your network possibly. Right, right. Oh, I can say, I can, if you want to send that link to her email, then I can just have her try to sign in from that link. That would, that's what you, that would be our test, right? Yeah. Can you get to that page from her computer? Because then. As long as she has it open, because she's not home right now, but if it's on her screen, I could check. But if you want to send it anyway, I could go down there. She should be home shortly. And then I can go ahead and just check her email and click on that link and see if it works. And then that would tell me, as you said, there's a network, something going on here. Because this is in a restarting phase. It might take a while to do what it needs to do. Okay. Like I said, I don't want to hold you up. So why don't I let this reboot itself up again here. I do whatever updates it needs to do. And then I'll try it again from the bookmark. And then I'll try it again from that email that you sent. Okay. And then I'll let you know if we still have any issues here. Okay. Sounds good. Well, thanks for your help, Robin. Yep, I will. How late are you there? I'm only here until about 5 today. And then what time do you, is your team? I usually start, I usually go 8 to 5. Well, sometimes I go later, but I've got kids moving out next week, so. Right. Network 10, 12 hours a day. I understand. Well, if I can't get it resolved before 5, I'll just let it ride to tomorrow morning, because I can still do things on my phone. You know, I just, I'm just having problems right now with the laptop connectivity. Let me know. Email me directly. I will. You have my email, Robin, at MainSequence? Because even if I go in any other room and start doing stuff, at least if I see that, I know one way or the other, and I can always jump back on. Yeah, I will let you know if I have any luck after all this happens, or if not, then I'll just say, hey, I'll connect tomorrow or something. Okay. I appreciate your help. I will. Thanks so much. Okay. Have a good night. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
