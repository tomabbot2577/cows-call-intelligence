    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Glenn Grayson at J. Aaron Associates. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good. I got a question for you. Okay. I have finally decided to make a transition to RingCentral from my traditional phone. and I have everything installed and I was under the impression that like if I just hovered over a phone number and PCR that I could direct click to dial from that okay so it's working on every other website so like LinkedIn or whatever even it's even working on my email through my PCR mail But on a name record, it's not working. So do you have any suggestions? So it could be a couple things. There might be some setup that has to be done within PCR or a change in the setup. Or it could be the app that you're using. Did you only do, like, the Chrome extension, or did you actually download the desktop app? So, you know what, I think I just have the Chrome extension. Okay, that could be it. And let me just check something here. What database do you log into and what username? I don't need the password. I see you have J. Aaron Associates and J. Aaron HCP. Yeah, the HCP one honestly could be deleted. I thought I had asked them to do that anyway. But the J. Aaron Associates one and then G. Grayson is the one that I log on. Let me just see here. Oh, I don't even see it enabled in this database. Oh wait a minute, hold on, I could be wrong. Brain fart there. No, it's not enabled in the database. Okay, hold on one second. I've got to do a couple things here. And we might need to make sure you have the right app. Okay, so I need to install the feature on your database. Okay, here's what I'm going to have you do. I'm going to have you go to System on the main toolbar in Peace Recruiter. Okay. Go to Users. Okay. And then go to Manage Users. Okay. Click on your username. Okay. And then under where it says Contact Information, where it says Contact Phone, is that your direct RingCentral number that they gave you, like the primary one for you? so that is going to be the primary number yes um it's being ported over at the moment from from comcast so it's not active in ring central quite yet okay that could also end up being a little bit of an issue but i'd also if that's the direct number for you then you would remove your office extension and one of the reasons is let's say when you get into texting um that you have like this will be the number that'll say like text subscribe to or things like that so that we can merge it in the next thing that you'll want to do is next to that contact phone field click the gear icon okay so I enabled it for the database you should now see in the sidebar ring central I see you okay what you'll need to do is put in your ring central direct number but it has in And no extension, but it has to be in that plus one format that you see above. Okay. Okay. So go and put that in. And there's going to be two more things we need to do after that. All right. Let's see. It's a temporary number at the moment, so I'm just trying to find it. Yeah. You're going to have to change all this then after you get that final number. And that's okay. As long as I know that it's working properly, then I know that I can – let me get rid of that. Then I can – I can usually remember stuff like this pretty easily, so I can just go back in. And I can also send you instructions, too. Don't worry about that. All right. So I'm just going to pull up my account here so I can get the actual phone number. Okay. Just copy and paste them. Just make sure it's in that plus one format. And then no parentheses and no dashes or anything like that, right? Right, yeah. Just plus one and the digits. Okay, so that is in there. Okay, and the other thing you'll want to do is where it says user phone configuration, go into that drop-down because it defaults to RingCentral desktop phone, which is basically a standalone phone version that they don't even support anymore. You'll want to make sure that you select RingCentral app in that drop-down. Okay. Okay. And then go ahead and hit save with those details so far. And let me know when you've done that. Okay. It says invalid RingCentral credentials. Okay. Yeah, we're not locked in yet. Oh, wait, hold on. I missed. That phone number, it also needed to be in direct dial. So I'm going to add that back in there. okay all right let's go back next to that contact phone field and hit the gear icon again so close any window that you may be in because I forgot to tell you to make sure you put under not only phone number but direct dial okay so I am back up in there okay so you should see the number in the phone and direct dial and over at the right has ring central app now see where it authenticate you'll have to click on that. Authenticate okay. And sign into your RingCentral account. Now this step here can also be done from what's called the myPCR page. Okay all right I'm should be authenticated. Okay and then let me know when you hit save on that. Okay. Done. All right. So that, so now the next thing is really just making sure that you have the app. If you, are you in a windows computer? A Mac. Okay. If you go, go in, I guess in your finder tool and look for ring central. So it wouldn't be a Chrome extension or anything like that. It would actually be an app that you would have installed. Let me know if you have that. Let's see if that's in here. So I do have the app on my desktop. Okay. Try making a call and let me know if it goes through. Through PCR or? Yeah. like open up a name record let's see do you have me in here even though no I don't okay on this I should just pull up my my record I think my cell phones in here okay actually only got main sequence I could put me in here if you want or even just call the company main sequence then just hang up all right so all right so open ring central always allow yes open ring central okay yes what it does it pastes that phone number that you're on and over to their app okay so it all out of I actually also didn't realize that it just opens up an activity page that's kind of cool well yeah the reason they do that is you will get we connect about every 20 minutes through an API that you know here's the numbers called or received calls from and it writes an activity if that numbers found on the record but what we do is the time you're making the call we pop that up too so that way if you wanted to just kind of write an activity and not have to click Add Activity. Okay, perfect. And if you don't want to, you just close the window. All right, so then once I get the number ported over, then just go right back into Systems, Manage Users, go into My Thing, go down to RingCentral, and then just change the phone number on both of those items. You'll need to, yeah, now you'll want to change the phone number in both those fields, but you'll also need to re-authenticate. Okay. Now what you'll notice is if you go to my PCR in your main toolbar, see how it says RingCentral status connected in green? That is also another spot that you'll now be able to re-authenticate. You'd really just be able to like click the link. Now you'd have to change the phone number in the other area, but you could just like click this link here. Sometimes, I don't know, every once in a while you might lose connection. Maybe if you change your password and ring central. You could also just kind of click this link and it'll ask if you want to remove it. It doesn't remove any of the other settings. It's just basically clearing the connection. And then once it's read, then you could click it again to sign in. So you'll need to change the number and sign in again. Okay. Okay. Well, hopefully I should have that body in the next week, but at least now I should be good to go. And I'm probably not going to use his phone number at all. I just wanted to make sure I was set up so that as soon as that number is ported over, I'm ready to go. I've been avoiding this for like literally five years. The other thing just to be mindful of with Ring Central is that they well, them and like other things, I guess, with a business number, you have to go through that. What's it called? TCR process to get your texting approved. I actually submitted all that stuff yesterday. So that part will take however long it takes. I've never been able to text anyway through my office phone, so that's actually going to be a bonus once I actually get to do it. Yeah, so once you're able to text through Ring Central, then you'll have not only calling but texting from PCR too. And then it'll copy that to the record as well, right? Yeah. Yeah, I will be honest from what I understand from people, it's a little bit of a pain in the ass process to go through. So just be very diligent in how you answered every question. Yeah, no worries. It's kind of what it is. I know that I've been with other companies having to do that whole thing, and, yes, it's cumbersome, and they want to block everybody. You put it a lot nicer than I did. Well, thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it. You are welcome. Have a great week. You do the same. Thanks so much. Thanks. Bye. Bye-bye.",
