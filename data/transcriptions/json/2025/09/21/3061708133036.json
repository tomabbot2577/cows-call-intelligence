    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Amanda over at Ringside. How are you today? Good. How are you? Good. Good. I was... Go on, Sam. Okay. Sorry about that. Okay. Go on. No worries. So I was trying to send out a form letter to an email address, and I keep getting a pop up that says uh-oh you see our recruiter could not send email email address is restricted or opted out and I looked at our opted out list it's just one name yes okay it's just that I do first okay so what does the message say that it may be opted out yes it's restricted or opted out okay and that That probably means that it's in the opt-out list. I went there and I could not, I searched it and could not find it. Because I was going to say, if it's just one name, sometimes what you might need to do is look at the email address itself. Like, let's say like it's robin at main sequence dot net. Sometimes you would see, but it's usually the standard like, oh, your email alias is not connected. If you're missing like the at symbol or the dot, like something with a bad format. which database is this in? This is the ringside restore. Okay restore ringside search partners. Okay let me see what is the name of the person you're emailing? This is Steven Gerlach so it's a S T E P H E N and then Gerlach G E R L A C H. Okay, and there's an email address and an email other. I pulled it from the, I was using the. Is it from the email address field? Okay, let me see. Got the hotmail email address, okay. Steven Gerlach he just added 8-22-2025 yep he called in and I was trying to send him an email for a resume question and then like a questionnaire so I'm like yeah he's brand new he's not That is so odd. You know what? I'm going to go in. And you're sending it as you, right? And what is your email? I'm sorry. Not email address. What is your username? Amanda. Okay. Let me go into you. I was like, well, I could just send them from Outlook. But I'm trying to send the questionnaire. Obviously, you can't really do that. Yeah, I got it. Let me see. See my girl lock. Okay, I'm going to do something temporarily, and then I'll turn it off. Under international settings, it's where you can see name. Okay, there is a thing. There's no status. And it is a hotmail email address. Okay, let me turn that off. Yeah, that's not there. That's really weird. It's definitely not international. He's here. Yeah, well, there's, like, okay, I have it on for one moment. If you refresh his name record, if you go to the email field, you'll now see this, like, little caution thing. Right now there's no status. but if you were to click it you could see if he was opted out or things like that it would kind of look up if it was on the I see the caution if you click it it lets you manage so why would I'll turn that back off it allows somebody to put somebody like like on an opt-out list right from the record. It is a neat little feature. Also probably I can imagine some of our users probably abusing that like oh they didn't want me to call so I'm just going to take them off the opt-out. Right yeah so I'm going to turn that back off. Okay because it's not like a per user thing. Yes. Okay, so why would... There's no activities. Okay, you're NSU. Email alias list. Your authentication is fine. You're emailing other people just fine right? I believe so. I don't send too many from from PCR. I'm not exactly the form letter PCR super user. And you're using the back office account or the Amanda ad account? Like your default alias? Yeah the Amanda is my default. All right. I'm just gonna back off. This is more like our contractor compliance emails. Okay let me see. I think I sent a couple out last week with no letter were you what form letter were you sending um it is it is um sorry pulling it back up um it is ringside resume request dash name first name last for the um Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. Rank sign, okay. Oh, I think I have something in there saying thanks and then name. The, sorry? Oh, in your letter you got like thanks, name. Oh yeah, so that way we change the name of who's sending the letter. So like if another person wanted to send it out, they update name to John. Oh well it's already got the signature tag in there. So whoever's sending it put their signature in. Yes, yeah we have that in there as well. So that way they have that. but just that way there's like a less formal, I guess. Can I do a screen share with you? Because I'm sending it to myself. I got it. Not seeing it on the app. I wonder if it's going to do with Hotmail. Could Hotmail be blocking? We were making a joke about the Hotmail domain being old school and dating us. But I'm pretty certain it still works as far as emails go. Yes, Hotmail. Now, Outlook.com can block emails due to various reasons, including spam filters, sender reputation issues, suspicious links or attachments. Hmm. Can you try just a, have you talked to him and told him that you're getting, you're having an issue emailing him? Does he know about that at all? No, no, he does not. Okay. is there anything that you would be willing to just compose to this person that doesn't have a link I'm just wondering if maybe that link in your form letter is getting blocked by hotmail just out of curiosity I mean I that's what's with hotmail I know yeah I can I can try sending that but removing the link and when you send it to yourself is the link working maybe the link yes let's click here to complete your questionnaire and it takes me to the ringside CA profile master okay no which just so you know that people do see that when they open it up I just wonder if maybe Hotmail is blocking some of these links. I can try the moving the link and just sending him the resume request. Yeah, and I'm going to see if anybody here happens to have a Hotmail email. I mean, I did, but I wouldn't even remember the sign-in. They probably closed it out. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got a test email. I am going to add this to Amanda Ringside. Okay, let's see. Robinson. Okay, I'm going to add this under email other. Let me see. One letter name was ringside resume. Dash of the fillable fields. Yeah, same thing. You got the block? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Something with Hotmail, the email address apparently, the mail server rejects it. Interesting. I'm going to do one now that doesn't have that link. I'm going to just kind of go in and modify this to take out the click here to complete your questionnaire yeah see if it goes over then yeah actually I'm going to do a different letter ringside resume request you know I'm going to take out anything, so it's only text. Send. Nope. Nope. Nope. I'm going to try a different form letter. I'm just going to type. I can't even type a message to any hotmail email address. Yeah, but doesn't make too much sense. I mean, I feel like you should still be able to. So I wonder if the same thing happens if I send it directly from Outlook. Do you have anybody that's emailing at the moment? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Because there is a database setting. And then you use the installed version. Outlook? You mean like the physical app? Actually, you know what? I'm going to put, hold on one second. I'm going to, unless Hotmail might have your domain block. That could also be something too. I'm going to try this test email. that's a Hotmail in one of my own databases. And that'll kind of tell us, does Hotmail block your domain or what's going on? Let me see. Let me try this. OK. Okay, this was Mackenzie's. Where was it? Okay, I'll put this under email other. same email I'm not black I think hotmail has your email domain block. Can I try the hotmail from my Outlook just to see if we get the same thing? If you go to my name record, you already have me in there, Robin Montoni. I have under email other, it's a Kenzie24 S at Hotmail. It's under the email other field. Perfect I see that. Very cleverly addressing the subject as test. All right see. So I just sent it. Outlook didn't give me like a pop out but I don't know that it necessarily would showing as scent I haven't gotten any bounce back emails. We got that one. Okay. I'm going to have you try this. Okay. And hopefully nobody's using it right now. Email set up. I'm going to do it for one second. outgoing mail setting I'm going to switch that to default which means when you click on to send an email it's going to open up in your outlook just so you can get this out I don't know why it's getting blocked but it does not appear to be necessarily a PCR issue but somehow office that they're blocking you okay do me a favor right now go to his record do it as you normally would but it should open up to send it in your Outlook screen. Let's see what happens there. OK. OK. And as soon as you're done, I'm going to switch it back where it opens the PCR mail screen. All righty. It's still opened up in PCR. are and when I hit send it still gave me the try it try it one more time like reload the record maybe like just like refresh the record okay timing thing because I thought I would save it so when you click the form letter icon it should be taking all of that but opening it up in your default outlook app It is not. Okay. Which version of Outlook are you using? Do you have the classic installed version? Classic, yeah. Because I know PCR, the PCR add-in doesn't work with the new one. The only thing I can really suggest, I don't know, is, like, compose it and then copy it and then send it. So that way it still has a connection to the record when it fills it out. I don't know what else to tell you about this because it's just somehow it's getting blocked. But it doesn't necessarily seem to be. There might be some like stuff in the back end that Office 365 is blocking. Or I'm sorry, Hotmail is blocking a combination of maybe. I don't know why because we're just passing it over to the mail server to send it yeah but there might be in there like where it's not directly coming from maybe it's a combination of things that then Hotmail gets suspicious if I include the link to the if you so if you generate it from the PCR screen, but copied it over to the message. You have to let it pop up so that way that link is generated related to the person. Okay, so I think I got that. Sorry, formatting's being a little weird. They have about five different fonts. That's how it goes. Steven, get your email address in here. Okay. All righty. I am sending it now. All right. So I sent it. I don't bounce back so that's good It looks like the email is showing in my sent. It looks like it's recorded in activities as well in PCR. Okay. Somehow Hotmail does not seem to either like having links or actually not even just links. You sending as like maybe through like a third party. Thank you. Yeah, it seems to be some kind of restriction with Hotmail. Interesting. When I text them, Hotmail is very restrictive. And it's really restrictive, yeah. And we all need Hotmail accounts again. Maybe we won't get such spam. Well, I'm not sure what do we want to do here from here. Should we just kind of see if he gets it and replies or? Yeah, I guess that's probably the best plan of action. But so far it's looking like it went through. I haven't gotten any balance packs or anything like that. hopefully I mean he's supposed to send over a resume so yes if he says yeah it doesn't seem to be a restriction on us because I was able to email a hotmail account and not get that problem so I think it's a combination of your domain but sending as us the film thank you think of I don't know if anybody else's experienced a similar issue with hotmail. I've heard of it. Unfortunately, I meant internally. But sometimes if there's an issue, recruiters will move on pretty quickly and just think that it's blocked or they had the wrong email or something like that and not necessarily mention it. But I think that's a good plan. I'll keep an eye out to see if he responds and then, you know, if he doesn't, then I will. I did one in my database to a hotmail that also has actually two profile links, and I'm not getting, yeah, I'm not getting any kind of error there. We have a workaround for now, but I don't know if that's something that we can fix because it seems to be something with your domain but sending to us. It's really odd. I wonder if we... I wonder if we could add them to the opt-in. Well, I don't think it's restricted from us, though. I think it's just getting in the same kind of message. I'm going to try something. Okay. I'm going to system. I'm going to add email as an opt-in. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Interesting. So I added that email address as an opt-in, and it worked. Yeah. Okay, so here's what I would recommend. What's his name? So at least going forward, you should be able to, Steven Gerlach. Okay, I'm going to take his Hotmail email address. I'm going to add it as an opt-in instead of an opt-out. email. Okay. Out of curiosity, can you try one more time sending him something? Are you willing to? Are you willing to? Since I just sent him an email, I don't want to inundate him just because I don't want to necessarily scare him away. Okay. Okay. Maybe I can address it as not certain. Got a potential error message. So maybe I can address it as I got a potential error message when I tried to send out my last email. so apologies that this is duplicated. Maybe I can try that. I'm just going to try it. Unless there was maybe something set in the past that between us connecting, like maybe got suspicious, there's like kind of like phishing or something that maybe... But adding it to the opt-in seems to be working. I'm no longer getting any kind of errors now. I'm trying to type out, use the form letter, but type out that maybe it was a duplicated message. Amen. They have the entire Hotmail domain in their opt-out list. Oh. Oh. Oh. So somehow you have in your opt-out list the entire opt-out the entire hotmail.com domain. So if you go to system, go to email setup and go to email opt-out or I'm sorry email opt-in opt-out list. Just type the word hotmail in the search option and you'll want to take that off. Oh, interesting. Don't know how that happened. Okay. I was not even thinking of that. I didn't even know you could do that, to be honest, that you could put a whole domain up there. I guess you can because you didn't want to email it. You wanted to block a whole company. Somehow hotmail.com got put in there as a bounce. Maybe somebody just had hotmail.com. I wonder if there's a record that has that. Hold on one second. I wonder if there's a record that just has hotmail email address hotmail.com. No. Email other email work. Those are the only other fields you use, right? Yes. It could have been at one point in time and then maybe somebody realized it and updated it but it was already too late. It's the only other thing you can think of. So that is probably why. I'm not finding anybody that just has that. So taking it off should fix it going forward at least. But you also have his email opt-in. So for some reason it ends up in there again. We'll know why. Yeah. Perfect. Well, hopefully that fixes it. I appreciate your assistance. I was like, I don't understand. I was kind of stumped there myself. All right. Anything else? I think that's it. Thank you so much. No problem. Have a good day. Thank you. You as well. All right.
