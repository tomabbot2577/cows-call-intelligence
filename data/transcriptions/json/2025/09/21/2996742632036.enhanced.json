    "text": " Thank you for calling this, Robin. Hey, Robin. My name is Kevin Ireland. I work over at Tradewind. I am a PCR user that is in need of some support. When I first started using PCR, I had, like, when my email was popped up, my PCR was synced in. Hi. I'm so sorry. I think my headset wire kind of got in a bad position that it didn't like, and it cut off there for a moment. I'm so sorry. This is Robin Mantone with Main Sequence. Who am I speaking with? This is Kevin Ireland with Tradewind. Oh, hi, Kevin. How are you? I'm doing well. I just had a quick question. When I first started using PCR a couple years back, I had the ability to – what I'm trying to do is I have my Outlook pulled up, right? Okay. And I have an email from one of the candidates for a position, and I want to save that email as an attachment into the position. And I used to be able to do it a lot easier. Okay. And now that I look at it, I don't even have my PCR synced up on my Outlook side, only on my PCR side. Okay. So, could be a couple things going on. It probably is best for us to do a screen share. Can I send you a link to join? Absolutely. Yeah, probably won't. Probably will be pretty quick. I'm going to guess maybe that one issue might be that if you're using that PCR portal added for Outlook, it might need updated. that could be one thing probably just see it so let's I just sent you an email Okay. Okay. I'm going to admit you. Okay. All right. So you're in the meeting. Hold on. I'm going to mute you real quick. Yeah. Yeah. Echoes. I should have turned that off. Perfect. I muted my side too. Okay. So what I'm going to have you do is in the bottom of that meeting window, there is the share screen option. It's with the square with the arrow in it. And when you click on that, it's going to pop up a new window. Go over to where it says entire screen. and then if you have more than one monitor, which screen to show. Okay, perfect. All right, so show me what's going on, and that will help me. Are you looking here? Yes, that's just your browser tab. Yeah, don't close it. Just minimize it. Okay. Okay, let's look at your Outlook here. Now, is this their web version? No, this is the app. Okay. Is this the new app? Our portal add-in is only supported with the classic version of Outlook. The reason is their new versions don't support COM add-ins. Do you still have the classic version on your computer? Give me one sec. Yeah, I think if you go to, like, the Windows search option down at the bottom left. well no it usually it'll say new outlook and i'll be able just to click it yeah like a setting yeah let's exit from here and let's go to your windows search option let's see if we still have the original one so type in outlook down there okay it says outlook app usually it'll say classic okay let's open that up oh this is classic okay let's uh perfect okay that's the app that we're going to have to use let's do this now let's go to file up at the top left there and go down to options at the bottom left and go to add-ins within that gray section in the sidebar okay let's scroll down in this list here there's inactive okay it's probably disabled if anything and okay all right okay so here's what i'm going to have you do first see where it says manage com add-ins let's click go and I'm going to have you uncheck some maybe some things that you're not using for example social connector or maybe one notes if you're not using those two apps in your add-in let's uncheck those and then let's check PCR outlook most people aren't using those two okay let's do that okay let's hit okay Okay, let's do one more thing. Let's go to that. You're going to save that now. Let's go back to file. And we're going to go back to the same place. Let's go back to options. and go back to add-ins and see what says manage com add-ins switch that drop down at the bottom to disabled and select go okay click on the one that says PCR underscore Outlook and hit enable we We want to enable it. OK. Let's go back to COM Add-In instead of Disabled. And let's see if we see PCR Outlook selected. We'll probably have to just scroll down a little bit. OK. So that might help here. Let's go OK. and let's go to file and select exit let's see if it tries to load it otherwise i think what's going to happen is we're going to also going to have to update it too okay so let's go back to the classic version of outlook oh real quick can i brag on my daughter oh how cute yeah she's a lot bigger now but she uh Yeah, mine's in college. Mine's in college. So I think this is that new one. Yeah, we need to be back in that classic Outlook. So you might want to make a shortcut to that one. Yeah, I will. Outlook. Okay, let's see if it tries. And otherwise, I think it's just like it's an older version. So it's going to try to. Okay, all right, let's exit out of this. Because that's letting me know right there that it's not going to have the newer ones. Let's exit out of there and exit out of here. Okay. Let's have you open up a new browser tab. So either Chrome or Edge. Any preference? Nope, either one. Okay. Let's go to a new tab in your browser, and I'm going to have you do a search for PC Recruiter Downloads. we had to do some moving things around or something and then i'm just gonna make sure on the right one okay go to that page so it'll be at the left it'll be the second option listed piece of recruiter from microsoft outlook um that green link right here yes go ahead and run that you're going to download and then run it or just let it do its thing yeah i'm on a call with pcr pcr come in i'm on a call with pcr what's up okay give me one sec thank you and if anybody else in your office is having this issue this should fix it i don't think anyone else in my office cares enough to try to link their inbox okay i do all the recruiting robin and that was your name right robin yes look at the memory on me today pretty good for a Friday home babe got enough coffee in me I guess see if there's anybody else I can brag on there's my nephew there's my middle daughter and that's my oldest my son very cute and I really like that beach background too so once you download that file we're going to have to run it where'd it go yeah where did it go Okay, go to your downloads folder. It's because I was sitting there trying to brag about my kids. That's okay. They're worth it, right? I try to do it every chance I get. Trust me. It goes by fast. I got mine home for the summer, and then I got to send them back off again. Okay, so once you open it up. One is at Ohio State. she's a freshman and then my son is at Ohio University wow that's awesome so now when you clicked it you're going to probably see a prompt that Google Meet doesn't share with me for security it's probably asking you to make a change on your device hit yes in that window if you see that no I'm just it's just asking me for the password to my oh okay This part, it doesn't let me see for security. So you must have settings on your computer that you have to put in your, like probably your Windows password in order to install a program. No, it's asking for my PCR password. It says to continue, enter an admin username and password. So my domain is Tradewind. Yeah, that's your Windows computer doing that. Oh, my B. You right. Yeah, some networks, especially if you're banking or healthcare, you find that a lot where they kind of have it locked down so you can't just install whatever you want on your computer without an admin password. Oh, this is going to require elevation. I got to go to my to our software company it's requiring access so can you just call me back Robin and let's call it 30 minutes I actually have a call scheduled in 30 minutes now once you run that file and go back to Outlook it should fix it okay sounds good if not I'll give you guys a call back yeah if not give us a call back but that should do it because it's just trying to get to the version 530. Now, once it does do it, I will give you a heads up. It's probably been connected and trying to write activities. So when you first go back to your, you know, classic Outlook, you'll see, I don't know if you ever noticed like where it shows like where your database you're connected to, it'll show like an activity queue. Usually that sits at zero. That for probably quite a bit is going to climb and drop and climb and drop as it's finding all those things that it couldn't write before. So it might be a little slow, but then once it catches up and, you know, sits steadily at zero, it should be all caught up. But if you have any issues, just give us a call back. I just have a training scheduled at 1 o'clock, so our time is – Oh, you're good. No worries. Yeah, no worries. I appreciate you. I'll get this dialed, and if we need something, here we go. And then you should have my email address as well from the meeting invite. so if you're set or not set just at least shoot me an email back so i know absolutely yes yes you deserve that you've been nothing but a great help thank you robin we'll talk to you soon okay oh no problem thank you all right bye-bye bye",
