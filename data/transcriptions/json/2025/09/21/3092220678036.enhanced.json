    "text": " Thank you for calling me. Oh, hey, Robin. How are you? It's Mark Goodstein. Hi. How are you? Good. How you been? Pretty good. So I got kicked out of SourceWare. I still have it because it said that the integration was disconnected, and it said to reenter the details to reactivate the integration on their widget. So I don't remember. So it's asking me for my username, my password, and my database ID. Okay. So the database ID, what it really is, you know, you can have multiple databases. Yeah. You have that ODBC. The first part is your database name, dot, followed by the ODBC. So the best way to get it in the clean format with no errors is if you go to system in PC Recruiter. Yeah. Type API into the search box. Yep. And then you'll see API settings. Oh, wait, hold on a sec. Yep, API settings, yep. Okay, so that's the database ID. You'll come right out of there. Okay. You'll notice it's like database name dot ODBC name. All right, hold on a sec. It says, well, it doesn't say ODBC. Right, but that's what's really after the dot. Okay, so I'm trying to, and also I just, I hope I, hold on. I don't know if I remember my password. Hold on. It says invalid username and password. So I wonder... Yes, that would be your PCR password. Do you have it stored in your browser? I think so. Where would I find it? Do you use Chrome? Yes. Okay, so if you do a search for Google Password Manager? When I'm in Chrome? Yes. and it might ask you to sign in okay so it said Google password manager yep okay and that should list all the sites that you have a password saved for there's like a whole list here yeah you'll want to go down to the P's it'll be piecerecruiter.net. Yep. Okay. Then once you click on it, it'll probably ask you to sign in if it hasn't yet. Okay, so now I'm in there. Okay. And I believe you want the one that'll say, it might say like www.piecerecruiter.net. Yep. Is that the one that I want? Yeah, because if you have, like, our learning management system or things like that, you might see those in there, too. I didn't even know I had this. I've never even seen this. This is so interesting. Okay. Yeah, this is how you – when you, like, tell your browser to save your passwords, this is where it's saving them, too. Okay. So now I'm going to reactivate. Yeah, so if you click the little eyeball icon – It still says it's invalid. Okay. If you click the eyeball icon next to the password, it'll show you what the password is so that you can copy it. Which I did. Oh, the username is admin, not mark. Well, it depends. When you go to sign in, what do you typically sign in as? Mark. Okay. So here's another one. Here it is. Here's the password with the username mark. It's not the one that I should use or the admin. Well, if you want to connect as you, then probably yourself. You just got to make sure, like if you ever change your PCR password, to immediately go change it in SourceWale as well. So that way it's not making like failed connection attempts. I got you. All right. I actually was able to connect. Perfect. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. You are welcome. Have a good week. You too. Have a good week. Bye-bye. Bye.",
