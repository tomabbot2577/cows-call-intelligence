    "text": " Hello. Hello, Christopher. Speaking. This is Jim with PC. How are you? I'm doing well. How are you? I wanted to give a quick call. I got your inquiry through our website the other day. I think it was about the AI suite trial that we turned on and just kind of wanted to reach out and see if you had any questions around that or what. Yeah, I was just hoping to get a demo on it. Okay, okay. Yeah, what it does is there's not really much to demo. It would take under five minutes. It's just a few little content generators within the system primarily, and I can walk you through right now if you'd like, show you how to use it. Well, I'm not in front of the computer. I'm doing lunch, and so I'd have to do it another time. And today I've got several meetings scheduled right after this. So can we do Monday? Yeah, what time works on Monday? Maybe we could do 11 Eastern. One second. Yeah, I can make that work. Okay, perfect. What I'll do, I'll send over a Zoom so you can take a look at the meeting there, and we can just run through maybe five, ten minutes, show you how it works, show you what it does. Perfect. Thank you so much. Very well. We'll talk to you then. Bye now. Bye-bye.",
