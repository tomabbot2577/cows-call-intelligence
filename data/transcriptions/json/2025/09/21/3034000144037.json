    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Good morning, Tyler. I think it's still morning. Yes. Joe Petarino at MRI Great Falls. I've been having difficulty with the last week with the PCR recruiter. And this morning when I went to respond to an email, I got this little thing about one by one, and I really couldn't type in it even. So the other day I couldn't open emails, and I don't know what's happening. So we do run some updates frequently. And if your PCR mail, like if you leave it on overnight or like you don't shut down your computer at night, but cache can get a little gummed up with it. So what we need to do is just go and clear that for you. So do you have your PCR mail page open right now? No, let me do that. Japanese meaning just a moment if you please. Okay, I'm logging in. Opening email. Okay, I've got the email page open. All right. Are you using Chrome as your browser? Yes. Okay. In the top right-hand corner of Chrome, you'll see those three little dots in a vertical line. You're going to click on those and then hit Delete Browsing Data. Let me find it. Download, bookmark, attention, delete browsing data. Okay. I've got that, and it shows browsing history, cookies, cache. So you'll select Advanced up at the top. Yep. The time range you're going to set to all time. Time range. All time. And then the only box that you want to have checked is the one that says cached images and files. Okay. I uncheck all the rest of the junk. And yep. And then once that's the only one checked, you'll hit delete data. and I get take the privacy guy get started or just get out yep you could just get out of there and then go back to your PCR mail page and just refresh that page Once that page is refreshed, go ahead and act like you're replying to an email. Okay, I'm opening up again. I'll just shut it down and now I'm reopening. Yep. Get your mail. It never happened in all the years I've been using these. It came up normally. Perfect. So essentially what happens is those cached images and files get saved in your browser to help pages load quicker. but if it's a page that's constantly changing like an email and things like that, it could be trying to load old files. So if that cache gets filled up and it's trying to just open those old files instead of writing new ones, that's where you can run into issues like not being able to open the pop-up boxes or them coming up really small. So every now and again, especially if the page was open while we ran an update, we just got to clear that cache out real quick okay well i appreciate it i've been using it for 15 years and that was the first time it happened yeah and it could there's a lot of factors in it too like as computers get older too there's less memory and so this is a good computer i think as you make it more complicated The other factor is I'm going to be 89 soon. So, you know, these things all add up. But like I said, it's a quick, easy fix, just clearing that cache. And if it happens again, just give us a call in and we can walk through the process together again. Okay, well, thank you very much. Appreciate it. Yep, no problem. You have a great day. And you too, sir. Thank you.",
