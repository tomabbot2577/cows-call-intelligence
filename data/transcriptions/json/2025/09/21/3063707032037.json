    "text": " Thank you for coming to Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Ed Peerges here from CWP Technical. We have a new person just started today with us at CWP. We thought she was all set up, but she can't log in to her PCR on her new computer. So I was looking for some help with that. just called PCR and they said it might be the password. Yeah, I believe it's the right one. So how do I go? I'm on my screen. How do I go and find out what Ashley's password is in my system here? Okay. So it will be hidden on the screen or it'll just be a bunch of dots. So you might end up having to just change it and then resupplying her with a new password. Okay. I'll show you how to get there. So you'll go to system in the main menu up at the top. Gotcha. Okay. Users on the left and manage users. All right. Got it. All right. And then click on Ashley's username in that list. Okay. All right. Now she popped up on the bottom here. Okay. I see that. Perfect. And And then underneath the contact information below that, there's her username. It's actually under the second heading called security information. It's the username, password. And you could just type in a new password in the password and verify password fields. I see. I clicked on security and what comes up is companies, positions, names, reports, other or security policy. OK, so instead, click on information at the top left above the security padlock icon. Gotcha. OK. And yes, it's still on this kind of below the contact phone number and the contact information. There's a heading called security information. OK, I found it. Yes. And I see that the password just has numbers in there or dots. So I should just go ahead and put something in there right now. Yeah, and verify password. Certain number of characters that I need to? I think it'll be eight is the minimum. And if you do enter something that it doesn't like, it'll give you an error message when you hit save. Okay. All right. Let's see if those are the same. Passwords contain parts of common passwords. Password test Star Wars. And that contained parts of common passwords. Okay. So I guess it didn't like that. Okay. Yeah. Let me just... All right. I'll see if it liked that one. Okay, it seemed to like that one. Perfect. So, yeah, you could just send that new password to Ashley, and it is case sensitive. So let me send that over. Let her know. I have her on the Teams meeting right now. So, Ashley, can you hold it? Your new password is capital A, capital S, capital H, Ash. Seven, eight, nine. Eight, nine. Pound, pound, pound. Okay, see if that works. Was A the first capital letter? They're all caps. They're all caps. Capital A, capital S, capital H. H. Seven, eight, nine. Seven, eight, nine. Pound, pound, pound. Pound, pound, pound. All right. We're in, baby. All right. Okay. Awesome. Okay. Thank you very much. That helps a lot. I really appreciate it. No problem, Ray Chad. if you need anything else. Okay, thanks. Bye.",
