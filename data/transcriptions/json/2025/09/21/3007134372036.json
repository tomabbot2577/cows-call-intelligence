    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Paul Pellegrino calling. I'm the admin administrator for my company, for 3D CRO Group. We just noticed that you guys did an update to the system. that I'm terrified that you're going to give me the wrong answer here. But you guys completely altered the format of summaries, which we have many thousands of them that were formatted in a very specific way that is an absolute essential part to our business. and they have all been reconverted into paragraph form opposed to bullet form. Okay, let me take a look. Tell me there is a way to revert this back because the AI generator that you guys put in is not helpful to us at all. Gotcha. Let me take a look here. Which database are you in, the 3D CRO group, new hires, or vendors? Yes, no, 3D CRO group. Okay, and what is your username? Paul. I mean, it's across all users. Okay, cool. Yeah, I just wanted to log in and take a look. All right, so the summary. Okay. So is there, let's see, is there maybe a name record I could look at that usually had bullet points but no longer does? I mean, there's thousands of them that are like that, but, I mean, if you want to just look at one as an example because this is by the thousands, I don't know, just put in Amy Mize. Okay. How do you spell the last name? M-I-Z-E. Okay. So if you go down to summary, we have a word that specifies a topic and then a colon and then information. And there's about 15 to 16 of these key words that we use that specifies the topic in which we all use in a uniform way in order for us to have specific information. We're more of like a retained firm, so we're not like a high-volume job board, you know, just spray and pray kind of firm. We're more of like a precision firm. And all the notes in the summary have now been converted into this big, messy block, which means that we'd have to spend five minutes probably on every record reformatting this whole thing. I see. To do that by the thousands, I can't even tell you the hours and the slowdown it's going to create us. Right, yeah, you don't want to do that. This is like non-starter for us. We can't operate this way. Right, yeah, that makes total sense. I will open up a ticket and let the development team know that the change was made around the update today, and we'll get back to you with a fix. yeah i mean is there is there going to be any way to revert it back this this almost seems like a permanent thing um i'm not sure we had the opportunity to like not opt into the ai generator feature that you put in because we i i tried it first of all it erases all the notes which is crazy. And then it converts it into like a, a version that provides 10% of the data that we actually have, which yeah. Right now, I think they've just released as AI as a temporary trial to all customers. And then eventually they'll shut that off. So I can ask if that is the feature that is making kind of a change to the format and messing things up for your database. I can ask to have them turn that off immediately, and maybe that will be the fix. But either way, I'll have the development team take a look. All right. Do you have a timeline on anything on when this can be done? Because, I mean, this literally alters our day, like an everyday moving forward. I am not sure at this point. I haven't talked to the development team yet, but once I talk to them, I'll have more information. Okay. Is there anything online that I can look at in the meantime? No, there wouldn't be any front-end changes. This would be all back-end changes, so nothing you would be able to really do to switch this off or go revert back. Okay. All right, so what's the next step? I understand this is limited, But as you can imagine, this is absolutely priority one for me right now. Yeah, that makes sense. So the next step is I will let our team know, and they might not even be aware that this happened. As soon as they're aware, they can start working on a fix. Okay. Is this Drew Rothman? Oh, no, this would be our development team. if it's related to the update, it's like the people who do the coding for the actual software. So I'll be escalating it to them. Okay. Yeah, because I have no idea why they would think this would be a benefit to alter the format and how notes were taken. Yeah, it might have been kind of like a byproduct of the update and oversight, and they might just not be aware that this happened, so I will let them know. Okay. All right, so when will I hear? Will you email me? Will you call me? Yeah, I can send you an email as soon as I hear back. What is your preferred email address? It's paulp at 3dcro.com. Excellent. It's in the system. All right. I will talk to them and get back to you as soon as I hear anything. Okay. All right. Yeah, please do. Thank you. Sounds good. Bye.",
