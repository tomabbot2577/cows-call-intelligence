    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Michael. I've got an open ticket and just been open for a couple days, and I'm just trying to add an email address or email to PCR, and I wonder if you have time to walk me through that. Yeah, absolutely. No, that's all right. So you're just adding an email alias? No, I've got a new user that's going to be starting next week. So I set them up in PCR as a user. And then I created an email address for them with GoDaddy, same as I have mine. I'm just a small shop, so it's just me right now. I'm not used to adding users. but I do have a valid email address. It's GoDaddy uses Microsoft. So when I set mine up a couple of weeks ago, well, anyway, I had this business for many years and then I shut it down for a year and I just restarted. So one of your trainers actually walked through and set up that initial email and I just have a new user starting and need to be stepped through that. Yeah, absolutely. Let's jump on a screen share and I can walk you through that. No problem. Okay. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And let me know when you're ready for the meeting ID. Yep. Okay. That is 202-249-733. Okay, RingCentral, open RingCentral to join. You can either join through the browser or open your RingCentral program. Either way will work. Sorry, that thing popped up and I said no to it too quickly. Always – let's see, there we go, join using browser. Cool. I see you joined. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Sorry, there we go. All right. Perfect. So I've got – do you want me to be in that user's TCR? Yeah. yeah signed in as that user perfect this is and then yep you go to a piece here yeah you already have a piece here mail excellent so go to configure at the top left and then start by going to mail servers right below that yeah you'll see right here this guy used to work for me this is an old email that's no longer valid. And then this is my attempt so far to set that up on my own. I can delete it and we can start over. Yeah, let's just check on that one. So use the action drop down to the left to edit. For some reason, I got a super small window here, but I don't know if I can. Oh, okay. I think that's just a issue with cache. So actually click on the three dots at the top right of your browser. And then go down to More Tools towards the bottom. Perfect. And then Developer Tools. And that'll open some coding on the right. You can just ignore all of that. And then up to the left of your web address at the top of your screen, right-click, and on the refresh button and select empty cache and hard reload. So that'll slowly reload the page, kind of clear the cache. What happens is sometimes we'll push little updates to the software, you know, every so often, a couple times a month. And some computers require a full clearing of the cache to display properly. So I think that's all that happened with the pop-up there. I wouldn't have been able to figure that out in a lifetime. Okay. And just you can clear that or click the X at the top right of those coding. There you go. All right, let's try that again. So go to Configure at the top left, Mail Servers at the top there, and then edit that bottom one. Excellent. Okay. Okay. So for this connection... I've got mine. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. So sorry to interrupt. So I was trying to do this on my own. So I've got... Okay. Let me... Can we copy paste from mine? uh so with our uh email connections you're gonna have to use the button we provide that says sign in with microsoft um so that'll because it kind of requires that type of connection that the that button gives you it's like an encrypted one and um is that not the right email account? It's not. It goes to my... Yeah, I thought so. Yeah, go ahead and hit close on that pop-up window. And then edit that bottom mail server again. And then click on sign in with Microsoft. All right, and then hit back. And say, use another account, and then sign into the correct account. Perfect. Hit next. So, I don't think... I can try this. Because I just, so I'll try it and see what happens. You can, yeah, there you go. Oh, okay. So you can close out of this pop-up window and hit sign in with Microsoft again. Let's try that again. I don't know. It kind of took us down the wrong path. Yeah, select that one. Awesome. And then where it says save sent email to sent items folder, switch that to no. Microsoft will duplicate the sent items. Yeah, perfect. then go to test connection at the bottom and we got green lettering excellent close that test and you leave at the bottom they're awesome yeah happy to help this so that's the the mail server side that's all the incoming mail so you could close that pop-up and then we'll do the outgoing mail which is alias address list up at the top center Okay, down below, looks like we're going to do a couple here. Is there one? Before we do that, to take out confusion, these are all old, right? Can I delete these? Yeah, you can click the X next to each one to delete them. Awesome. And then click the pencil icon to the right of that one it just created. And click on Sign in with Microsoft. And sign in to the desired account there. It didn't get a reply to address, so copy that over on the left where it says from address. Copy that over to reply to address so they match. Then at the bottom left, it says delay between emails. Switch that to 3,000. That'll put 3,000 milliseconds or three seconds in between your outgoing bulk mail to help keep you out of spam. Then hit test connection. We're hoping for green lettering somewhere here. Okay, let's see. SMTP client is disabled for the tenant. Okay, I know how to fix that one. You can close that test and hit save. Then in a new tab in your browser, go to admin.microsoft.com. Okay, go ahead and close this pop-up window. Stop letting me click on that. If you click outside of the box into the other, yeah, all right, and then scroll all the way down to the bottom of this page and click on go to main account holder sign in. and sign into your GoDaddy account for the main account holder. So that's probably, yeah, your... I think it's going to be my Gmail, but... Okay. We're going to try Gmail. Okay, now we'll try TechRecruiters. So this is usually a username rather than an email address for... I don't know what to do here. Try clicking on Use Email at the top right of that box, of the username box, and try Try signing in that way with an email address. Oh, that's not – okay, it's having you create an account. So it doesn't look like there's an account attached to the Tech Recruiters one. Go ahead and hit back. So I would have created this before I got my business relaunched under a Gmail account. Could I try Google? Maybe just enter your email address, the Gmail one up at the top. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Awesome. Let's see. Email and overview. Go to Admin on the left, and then Advanced. And then, okay, it's Exchange. All right, so on the right, go to Sign In, and sign into your account, the main account holder of this Microsoft. Excellent. Okay, so what I'm going to exchange, I'm looking for, I'll go to settings on the left. Perfect. Then go to mail flow. and uncheck the box under security that says turn off SMTP. We want that actually turned on. Perfect. Then hit save at the bottom. Cool. And you can close this browser tab. The whole thing? Yeah. And you can close this browser tab as well. We'll just go back to PCR mail. Perfect. In the bottom frame, click the pencil icon to edit that alias. And where it says IMAP server, select a server. Use that dropdown to select the new mail server we connected up. It's on the right. It says IMAP server. There you go. Office 365. Perfect. Hit test connection again. And it sometimes takes 10 or 15 minutes to register that we've unchecked that box in your settings, so that might not... Yeah, so that's all right. You can hit the X on that and hit save. And while it's doing that, go to email folders at the top center. Let's see if it gives you... Okay, that's good. So at the top right in the action menu, go to the gear icon, top right of the bottom frame, sorry. Okay, so that's the wrench. So then under Office 365, downwards, look for the deleted folder. There it is, deleted items. items. To the left of that, go to Action and Mark as Trash Folder. Then you can close this pop-up window with the X at the top right. And then also in the top right action menu, click on the gear icon. right here yeah all right and once again starting at office 365 mail downwards look for sent items and then action mark as sent items perfect you can close that at the top right so we've connected up your incoming mail connection we've connected up the outgoing mail it may take 10-15 minutes to register that we have connected that. And then we mapped the trash and the sent folders so PCR knows which ones those are. So I think that should be good. It can take up to 24 hours to fully sync once you first connect a mail server. So you should start seeing everything this time tomorrow at the latest. Let's check on one more thing. Oh, sure. When did the folder start showing under here? That would be in the next 24 hours. Yeah, same thing. Okay. Once it kind of fully syncs up. Yep. Then go to configure at the top left. Again, go to preferences as well. I just want to make sure you have the activities turned on. Go to activities on the left there. Oh, you already do. Excellent. Cool. Yeah. So you should be all set. If you're not able to send out email and all those folders on the left aren't populated by this time tomorrow from this username, give us a call. We will start troubleshooting, but everything looks like it's set up correctly. What was your name again? My name's Garrett. it. Okay. Garrett, thanks so much. Super helpful. I appreciate it. Yeah. Happy to help. Reach out if you need anything else. Okay. Have a good day. You too. Bye.",
