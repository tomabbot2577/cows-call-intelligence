    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Giselle with the Newport Group. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Thank you. I have a question. So we have different databases, and one of them is called Newport Internal. And I was just wondering how I can give another recruiter access to that. currently all I know is the admin, the one that I use has access to the Newport Internal, but I wanted to give one to one of our recruiters. So you'd have to go into that database and add their username. Okay, gotcha. And then they can just use the same password or will I have to update that as well? You would have to, when you, so it'd be just like as if you're starting a brand new user you have to go in and it is better to create it with the same username and password yep gotcha and that way it doesn't matter which one that they're going into but the usernames have to be created per database that's the way how you oh out of one and into another okay gotcha all right no worries thank you so much i can yeah i think i can do that on my side now thank you have a great day thanks bye",
