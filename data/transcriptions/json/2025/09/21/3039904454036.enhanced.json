    "text": " Thank you for calling me. I apologize. I could not hear you. What did you say your name was? Mackenzie. Mackenzie. Hi, Mackenzie. This is Amanda calling from ringside. How are you? Hi, Amanda. I'm actually looking at a ticket for ringside right now about QC Rangles ring central activities. Yes. Yes, that's exactly. I feel like it's been a saga for the last, couple weeks. I apologize. We've just been very busy lately. Low on people, high on tickets. I'm looking at this now. I'm trying to figure it out. It looks like UC Randall's set up with RingCentral. I'm not sure what's going wrong. I'm just trying to troubleshoot it right now. Do you have anything to add to this context or are you just wondering where it's at? Yeah, I don't really have anything, unfortunately, to add to it. We've done all of the, I guess, the troubleshooting on our side, you know, as far as, like, signing her out, signing, you know, re-authenticating her back in. And, you know, I even did on, like, the, you know, the admin user portion, you know, where you're entering in, like, their phone number and all that. you authenticate it there as well. So I've authenticated it in all places, double-checked, you know, she's using the RingCentral app, not the phone, but still does not seem to be picking up those those activities and I mean we know she's making dials and giving texts. Yeah, let's try and figure it out. It's actually really nice to have you that you can help me. We can maybe solve this together. Yeah, so I just adopted this database administrator role not too long ago, so I'm not as savvy as the last guy. But I was taught a couple things to do, and I did those couple things. But I'm not sure. I don't know. I kind of want to do them again now that her username's been reauthenticated today. So let me try and run these scripts again. It's basically just setting a date in a file back, and then the crawler should find it again. That's what I was told. Let me try to run this script again, and I'll see. If that does anything. What are you going back to, if I may ask? 89 days in the past because we can only find the last 90 days or so. So there's a script to go back to basically set her usernames file back 89 days and then in theory, our automated crawler or whatever, the service that does that should find it again and like catch up anything that they missed in those 89 days so i'm gonna run this again now that you've like authenticated her fresh today and see if it does anything perfect perfect yeah and that's she just started june so 89 days would hopefully catch anything since she's been here yeah ringside search underscore qc randall i was taking a look at the file and it was kind of interesting i don't know if i could delete this and it'll just recreate itself or not but her her ring central q file is like oh no it does have oh no uh yeah it's like missing a couple things that other usernames on your system have so i'm like wondering i wonder if i could just delete this and just re-establish would you be able to just re-establish it right now if i just kind of like swiped it and you just redid it um so like re-sign her out and then re-authenticate her well basically i'd be kind of deleting it from the back end so uh you wouldn't have to sign her out i'd be doing that uh but there's like this file that uh our queue like our sorry our crawler or the service that comes and finds it and like writes activities it'll find this file and it reads it and it should like write activities for that username but this for some whatever reason hers is like missing some stuff like what's your username if you don't mind me asking amanda yeah um it's just that amanda oh okay let me find it let me see yours let me find yours I'm looking at all of them and we said, okay, Amanda, I think I scrolled past it too quickly. Amanda, is this the error file or the actual file? What the heck? All right. How much time do you have, Amanda? I have some time. All right, great. Oh, that's why I searched. I want this file. I'm going to open yours. Yeah, you actually have a username and a value for the date and an ID. The QC Randall's file is just kind of blank. I'm wondering if I delete this and we start over kind of thing. You know? Let me compare again. I know you can't see what I'm doing. Sorry. No, no, no. You're good. You're good. Yeah, I've been trying to wrap my head around what's going on here. Also, I noticed that QCRandall doesn't have an error log file where all the other usernames do, which is abnormal. I have a question, Amanda. Do you know the lore or the history of your ringside search PCR account? and specifically there's two databases on the front end. There's like ringside search partners and then there's restore ringside search partners. Do you know why there's like one that says restore in, in the front of it? Or database in the past? I could believe that's, that's it. It's been, I've been here for, let's see, seven, seven years. And we've been using the restore. So I think what happened was there was an issue with the old one, and then we had to restore it, and therefore now we have restore ringside search. Okay. Did QC Randall exist, like, for seven years as well, or she knew? No, no, no, no. She just started. We would have set her up probably mid-May. She started June. Okay. Did it ever work for her? Or does it never work? I think it might not have worked. Ever? Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. I'm using my senior. Somebody's much more veteran status than I. I'm going to ask if I delete central queue file. And then we establish it's going to cause any catastrophic consequences. I want to write any activities and their queue file is missing some information that the other usernames seem to have in the file. Ring central. Hopefully he responds. It's kind of end of day. It's all right. He's like a late. He works late. Thank you. I'm just beefing up my message to him adding more information. I'm going to look at the actual file name and directory so he can go look at it. Copy and paste all these things here. I got this. That's got to be... We got to figure this out. You called and I answered while I was looking at this ticket. Right? That means it's meant to be. Yeah. And it said you were from Columbus, which is cool. I was just in Columbus the other day at a concert. Nice. What concert? It was a band called The Warning, which is a band from Mexico. Oh, that's fun. What band were they playing at? Kemba Live. Okay. That's actually really close to our office. Kemba Life is about... We're basically on the other side of nationwide, past the ice rink. I don't know Columbus that well. At Kemba, you're right next to the baseball park. Sure. I didn't know. Usually when they're lining people outside, you're kind of like right across the street from from the baseball I guess okay okay I there was a huge line and yeah I guess there was like a bunch of stuff around there um yeah yeah if you go like a stadium nearby yeah if you go a block south and then you go um to the east um we're just down that street it's probably like a 10 minute walk sweet well that that was a cool venue it's very much like venues I've been to, but the t-shirt was 50 bucks. That was wild. T-shirts are going up in prices. That's usually what I you know, nobody gives tickets anymore, so you can't collect your ticket stubs. So you're forced to buy merch. Well, the shirt's way cooler anyway. Yeah. I keep telling myself that someday I see people selling their band tees from the 60s and 70s and those are going for like $300-$400 and my band tees are definitely going to be worth that someday for this band that nobody's heard of at least in my case, nobody ever hears of my bands Hello? Testing, hello, hello. Hi, can you hear me? Yeah, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Okay, my microphone shorted and I had to reestablish the connection to it. Sorry, I was talking and effectively muted. Sorry about that. Have you ever heard of The Warning before I just mentioned it? I had not heard of The Warning. Oh, well, they're pretty cool. I suggest checking them out. Yeah, what type of music do they do? it's a three piece rock band of three sisters three girls 20, 23 and 25 years old bass, guitar, drums awesome they sing in English yeah my Spanish is non-existent actually to be fully transparent that's cool well I don't know my daughter likes Spanish. She's learning it. And I tried to speak it to her through Google Translate to help her learn it. That's kind of cool. That is cool. Yeah, I didn't do... It's hard to pick up, though, in your 30s. Yes, yeah. Absolutely is. I went the Asian languages route, so me and romance languages were just, we don't get along. You went the what route? Oh, like, I took, like, Japanese and Chinese, just to be different, I guess. That's sweet. Did you ever go to Japan? I did when I was in high school, and then in college, I actually studied abroad in China. awesome I had a friend who did that he taught English in China for like four years that was during the pandemic too which is crazy yes that is crazy yeah I thought about I thought about doing that but But, you know, my mother at the time was not crazy about a 22-year-old going and living in a whole new country. I would feel the same way. Good mom. I don't know. That's scary. Yeah. Yeah. I totally get where, now that I'm older, I get where she's coming from. So, like, okay, yeah, probably not the best idea. Okay, so he did respond. He said the RC username in that file is empty, which is probably the problem. That's what I was thinking. The username doesn't have an ID, so maybe I can fix that manually. I can look up UC Randall's ID and maybe just add it to the file. One second. No worries. Let me perform tech surgery real quick. If I can figure it out. I think I know what to do. What do I mean? See, that's a whole other language in and of itself. Tech language. Yeah. A lot of people are struggling with computers. Wow, I just combined like four words. The last run date of that might also be causing the problem, not sure. Okay. Should I delete this and reestablish it? Or should slash could. Could I delete it entirely? And should slash could I delete it entirely and start over? This user is recently set up. And so the customer is saying it never works. I think that would work. Yeah, it seems like if it's missing vital information that would hopefully... Yeah, right? I mean, delete it and reactivate them? Okay, all right, sweet. Cool. All right, all right, so let me do a couple things. I want to make sure to remove this token in the database for QC Randall. So I'm here on the SQL table where we hold that. And I'm going to run a delete query on this token. Don't worry. I know what I'm doing. Delete from a lost client token. SQL language. Where token ID is this specific ID. this one unique 15 digit number here but only affects that all right I'm going to delete QC Randall's token there goes so now portal capture those are fine the ring central token is gone from the back end so now it should say QC Randall is no longer authenticated if you were to log in as her. I am logged in as her. I was before you called. I refresh the MyPCR page and then it says RingCentral status connection issue refund in case you need it. Cool. I'm going to go to this file and delete it. Make the backend file that the crawler would find and read and then start to log in and write activities for. Where is it? QC Randall. All right, we're deleting this. Bye-bye. Okay, it's gone. So I think you can try to reestablish QC Randall, and hopefully that would do it. Okay. Sign in. I might have to set the date back, too. do you want me to hold off no no no go ahead no you need to create the file for me to set the date back on it because if you create it right now it'll have today's date but i'll set the date back um like whatever 89 days 59 hours or sorry 23 hours i think about minutes in an hour yeah 20 whatever 89 days 23 hours back so that the crawler could find it within that time and then it should pull whatever from that day. She has been re-authenticated. Great. I'm going to refresh this. Refresh this query to find the token again. Sweet. Awesome. Token's on the table in the back end. Let me go to see that. mpq file again all right sweet it created the error file that I was wanting to see let me read this and it does have a username wait no the username ID no the phone system username Is QC Randall like a deleted user that was remade or something? I don't know. Not that I'm aware of. Does it? No, that shouldn't matter. What the heck? Let me look at the user records table. Quinn Quinn Crandall Q Crandall That's what, so row 33, okay. Scroll over to the left, find her ID number. Where is it? Yeah, why isn't this going in there? Let me verify that this number is your username ID. I know, I have your ID. Let me see, where's Amanda? Where's the Amanda username here? this one row three all right okay your record id is one four five okay that's not the same okay okay so i don't know where that id comes from that is the same user that's the same database All right. Well, let's see. Let's do one thing at a time. So yeah, it's today's date. So it'll probably, if it is working, it's only finding like whatever from this moment just a minute ago going forward. So now I'm going to run that script to set this file's date back again. And then we should, I guess, just like see if that works. Spring side search on this little screen. I'm going to run this. Reset complete. All right, let me refresh this. Okay, it set the date back of the file to May 7th. So it should pull, if it is working, it should pull everything that happened since May 7th. And I don't know what to do other than just like wait a couple minutes and see if that, let me ask how, how, how often does the central forward scan or do. I'm actually on the phone right now do you mind if I just put you on hold so I can pick up a call do whatever you want to do thank you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Yo. Hey. Successfully. Yep, you can continue. Go ahead. I was going to say success. I was a little afraid that I lost you there when I swapped the calls, but it was somebody giving me a call back earlier. I'm just chatting with the senior. I don't know what you need to even call him the biggest brain in the company. He said everything else. So I'm just chatting with this guy and. Okay. He thinks that there may be an issue happening. Okay. He's telling me now to connect with one of our other developers who typically works on RingCentral issues and tell him that this is happening and to look at it. So he thinks there might be like a bug. Is there any other usernames that you've set up recently that is having the same issue or perhaps someone you've set up recently that's working properly? So the one that was, and she wouldn't have anything because she is no longer here, but she was set up at the same exact time, would have been Jay McFarland. Jay McFarland. Let's check in your database and see. Wait, you said she wouldn't have anything? she would but she she hasn't she left her employment like two weeks ago so she wouldn't have anything the last two weeks but she'd have i'm just yeah i'm just wondering if um if jay mcfarland like if you actually did set up jay mcfarland and it was working you know i'm assuming you do the same things when you set people up right so if one works and one doesn't That's kind of weird. It seemed like it. It was working. Outbound SMS. Okay, yeah, Jay McFarland was working. I see a bunch of Jay McFarland SMS outbound, inbound activities. Okay. I just did an activity search. All right. let's try and search QC Randall I see an inbound received for QC Randall today on 8-4 is it working now? let's go back a little bit in time let's go to June 1st I'm going to search for QC Randall, and I just want to search for, I don't know, inbound right now. Okay, okay, okay. I see some inbound calls from July 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th. Sweet, sweet. All right. Was there zero, absolutely zero things in the database for QC Randall? Yes. we'll just go back to May from now until May 1415 results for QC Randall SMS outbound inbound it looks like it looks like that might have done it oh awesome and are you looking at activities yeah I'm running an activity search in your database Got it. I was looking at the analytics tab. Oh, the analytics will take a second. The analytics database, the way it works is it's like a separate database. Basically, the analytics database will scan your original database and pull info into it. So it's kind of a process that analytics will take longer to populate than the original database would. so it will eventually make it to analytics in theory oh the qc randall file was um it looks like it ran and um the date is now once again eight four at 5 17 so it looks like it ran whatever six minutes ago um do you want to do a couple you want to like check and see um yeah and make sure it's all good i mean i just i just ran an activity search in the restore ringside search partners database from May 1st to August 4th for username QC Randall and I to search the activity types outbound, comma, inbound, comma, SMS. And I get 14, sorry, 1,415. Perfect. I think it did it. I started off with text because that was my first. Okay. All right, 246 texts. That's looking good. Cool. And everything. I think we fixed it. I don't know what went wrong, but just wiping it out and doing it again, I guess, as it goes in tech. Try again. It has solved many problems. Right. Try, try again. Okay. Yeah. I mean, it looks like it. So that's awesome. Sweet. All right. Well, I don't know exactly what was the issue. Hopefully, you know, now that it's connected correctly, that it keeps working. It should. And definitely let us know. We can remedy it again. Perfect. But I will still look into this thing that my senior tech is saying to me. Like, why does this file not have a username? Because your file has an ID number next to RC underscore username. And QC Randall, for some reason, does not. He's hung up on that. But maybe the other dev changed it so you don't need it anymore. I don't know. But it looks like it's working. So for all intents and purposes, I think you're good for now and hopefully for good, you know, good, good for good. Perfect. Thank you so much, Mackenzie. I really appreciate it. Sorry about the delay and the, you know, back and forth. I was like, it's probably easier to call because, you know, emails. You know, yeah. Awesome. You like God is like helping us out. Heck yeah. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Have a great one and have a good evening. Yeah. Thanks, Amanda. All right. Have a good rest of your week. You too. Bye. All right. Bye-bye.",
