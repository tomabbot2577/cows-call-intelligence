    "text": " Hi, you've reached Jen Otto. Please leave a message and I will return your call. Thanks. Hello Jen, it's Jim Lombardo with PCRecruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just to follow up with you. Checking in since our demonstration of PCRecruiter had such a short week last week, got away from me, so I had you on my calendar today to circle back, kind of follow up, check your interest level and see where everything stood. If you have any further questions on PCRecruiter or if you were closer to a decision, if you would give me a quick call, Let me know how I can help. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. Hope to talk soon. Bye-bye.",
