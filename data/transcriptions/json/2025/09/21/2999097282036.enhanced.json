    "text": " Hello, this is Sharon. Hi, Sharon. It's Robin Mastroni with Main Sequence. Hey, Robin. How are you? I'm good. I got this form back. Okay. So what I wanted to ask you, now you're having the problem when you log in through PC Recruiter through a browser, correct? Say that again? Logging into PC Recruiter for what? Through the browser, like if you're going through Chrome? Yes. Okay. All right, so I wanted to ask you, is there a preference of what you want me to reset it to? A password, you mean? Yeah, or do you want me to just kind of make up something? Just make up something and send it to me, or I'll write it down right now. Okay, because I can make it be whatever you want as I'm in here, if you want me to set it how you want it to be anyway. But I didn't want to ask that in an email because I don't like doing that. Okay, let's use the email before that I thought I had that didn't stick. So at capital B, these are kind of complicated. It's a little sentence. So your username is S-T-S. Okay, so capital C. Yeah. And then dollar sign. The number four, number zero, backslash, small m. Oh, I wonder if the backslash could be a problem. Oh. I wonder if that could be it. Because sometimes like that kind of stuff interferes with code, especially like online stuff. Okay. Well, then let's just do. Is there when you had a problem as soon as you create a password with that? Is that when it started? Probably. I guess I don't know. This was clear over the last night or Saturday. Trying to get the new, all the stuff to work for my new business, my new desk has been a little challenging. So I guess I don't remember. Okay. So let's do it this way then. Capital B. Sorry. Start over. capital B, dollar sign, four, zero, lowercase m, the number four, capital D, capital F. That's eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah, it shouldn't really matter how many characters. Okay. Oh, okay. Well, unless you set your database to care about characters and stuff like that. There are certain things that you can't use, like it can't be part of your name, can't be the word password. I'm in a 1234 yeah yeah yeah you surprised some people do that like let me get like admin admin it's like oh yeah my husband you like for bank stuff he'll use our dog stop it's four letters you've got to make it more complicated than that okay so do me a favor try going into your database now and let me know if you can get in all right yeah I wonder if it didn't like that backslash that never even occurred to me and it should have it works okay perfect it totally works oh my gosh anything else connected to your database like PCR capture things like that make sure that you update those too because that can also cause the logout issues because it okay I don't trying to connect with you you're gosh you're right okay so sometimes when I go to get into a PCR and then I then I go to like I'm in LinkedIn recruiter and I go to do an update it doesn't it but the update part doesn't show so how do I know a PC capture okay I don't need a PCR capture extension at the top right of your browser? Yes. Okay, click on that. And does it say logout or anything like that? It's got a capture LinkedIn recruiter, LinkedIn recruiter light, LinkedIn sales, LinkedIn, and the career builder, and then logout. Okay, so hit logout at the bottom left. Okay. And then the PCR site URL popped up again it says login. Okay now does it say like ODBC and then your company name at the end? It says ODBC dot dot the words new company. So that means you haven't connected it to your database that's just like a sample so if you're in Peace Recruiter right now if you copy that URL that you use to get to your login page okay you have to paste that over on top of what you see if it's ending in my company okay the database oh you can just copy the whole URL that used to get your login page okay if I'm already it where where would the you are if I'm already in PCR like under basic search you know company name how do we How do I go back to the beginning? The URL at the very top, do you already have that copied? No, I can't even find it now. I have my PCR company name, position, roll-up, schedule. It should be above that. It'll say, like, https www.peacerecruiter.net, like that whole long URL of what you're actually, what you're on. Okay, so exec is what I, okay. You've got to copy that whole line, though. Alright, let's try that. Where did it go? So once you've copied your login URL, then click on the extension again. Go back to PC capture. Oh my goodness. Paste. Alright, let's see if it lets me log in. It says username. And that's where you'll pick S-T-S or type it in. Okay, and then the password. And then make sure you select your database name too. Oh, I popped up Thomas Agra. Okay, log in. I don't have Recruiter Lite or LinkedIn Sales. I have LinkedIn Recruiter, then I have Premium Recruiter. Do all of these things need to be on? I would leave them all selected because it might show that name, but it's really kind of controlling like the beginning URLs. And there was, I forgot which one, like if you didn't have LinkedIn turned on, even if you're using Lighter Recruiter, it might not pop up. So just leave them all on. If you don't go to that page, then it doesn't really matter. It just controls what page could it pop up on. Okay. And then, so now I'm back to the extensions. It says full access for PCR capture. And then under Zoom Info Chrome extension, it says access requested. Does that mean, what does, do you know anything about that? Or is that out of the PCR realm? That? Wait, what are you in now, Insignia? Where I go to like the, like the PCR capture at the top of my bar that had the extensions. The first extension was PCR capture. The second one was Zoom Info Chrome extension. and it says access requested. To give an extension access to the site, click it. I probably do. Oh, that's Zoom info. Yeah, normally that might be. Okay, yep, I don't have Zoom info, so I don't need that. Okay, so every time I go to log into PCR now, PCR capture should automatically pop up. Well, PCR capture will only pop up if you're in somebody's LinkedIn page. So if you just go to LinkedIn, it doesn't pop up. But if you pull up somebody's page, that's when it will appear at the right. Okay. I'm trying somebody that I was trying to. It's not popping up yet to add to PCR. Do I need to maybe shut my computer down and restart? so you went to somebody's page right yeah okay here's the other thing let's try when you click directly on your extension okay um you should see like all those options for um um hold on one second where it says basic mode dark mode capture the default company What do you have selected there? Are all three of them off? That would be under my extensions under full access PCR capture, you mean? No, like if you just click directly on the extension at the top right of your browser. Okay, that's what I did. Okay, so that's where you're seeing what sites. It should now be connected to your database. And then over at the right of that, it's saying basic mode, dark mode, and capture to default company. which are they all off? I don't have any of those words in there at all. If you click on the extensions icon which is that kind of black looking puzzle piece yeah do you have PPR capture pinned so that it's showing? I didn't or I did but then I didn't and I put it back on again so it's there but I don't see any dark mode anything that you just described okay so at the top right you see that the purple green and blue extension okay okay and that should pop up your connection window okay where this got the LinkedIn recruiter the recruiter light and all that Oh basic mode it's down below basic mode dark mode to capture to default company okay basically is not on okay perfect go ahead Okay. No, that's good. Dark mode is not on, but capture to default company is. Okay. So capture, so I was just more concerned about basic mode. So capture to default company, you might want to turn that one off. That gives you the flexibility of getting the company that they work for if you want a company record. So once you've done that, what I would probably do is go over to another, like open up a LinkedIn page. maybe close other ones just in case it's kind of conflicting with another page that might be open. Yeah, that could be too. All right, let me sign out, I hope. Sometimes it's good for people to just go out of LinkedIn completely and then go back to somebody's page. Okay, let me get back in. Okay, let me go to the guy I was trying to pull in. There, click to update. There we go. Okay, you got it to work. Okay. That, I think, is all I need then. All right. Well, if you need anything else, just let us know, okay? Thank you so much. Fire for all the – I don't mean to be dense on this stuff, but sometimes I just – it's not – I don't know. And I still don't know where your email was going to. It wasn't going to junk. It wasn't – it's bizarre. But thank goodness you thought of my Gmail because that's where we started everything the other day anyway. So thank goodness you thought of that. I appreciate it. No problem. Thank you so much. That's Thomas at ThomasAGRI.com. Mm-hmm. But your other emails were coming through, just not the one for the reset, which is bizarre. Yeah. And I wonder if your email is somehow blocking because maybe there's like a link to sign the document. I'm not really sure, to be honest. I got to get an IT person to help me because I'll bet that was it. I'll bet it was some sort of, but I'm going to be getting contracts back on DocuSign, so I got to make sure that those work, right? So I'll bet that was what it was. it was my system wasn't letting it in and I don't know yeah you might want to see if there's some security settings within your account like who hosts your email is it like gmail or office 365 so it's an office 365 for your work yes there might be some settings in there that maybe you have to adjust or something okay that's how I do it okay good to know all right all right I'll let somebody else figure that out because I'll just mess up if I dig into it but thank you for that I appreciate that tip. No problem. Have a great day. All right. Have a good day. All right. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
