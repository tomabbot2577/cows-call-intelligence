    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. My name is Evan. I'm calling from V20 Recruiting out of Dublin slash Columbus, Ohio. Yeah. Trying to access my PC recruiter account, and it just keeps me on the login page and says loading. I'm also being prompted to install a launcher for either Windows or Mac. I haven't had any issues. Yeah, that download link is just always there. Okay. I don't recall seeing it before. Yeah, it's always on the bottom left there. Do you normally leave your computer on overnight? No. Let me take a look here. What's your username for the database? It should just be Evan. Let me in right away. So what we're going to try and do here is in the top left-hand corner of your browser, are you using Chrome? Yes. Click the three dots that are in the top right-hand corner, and then you'll go to where it says Delete Browsing Data. Okay. Yeah. and that'll open up another screen excuse me i got a hiccup out of nowhere that'll open up another screen to clear your browsing data you want it set to advanced the time range set to all time and the only box that you want to have checked is the one that says cached images and files. Okay. And then hit delete? Yep. Okay. And then once that's done, go back to your PC Recruiter login page and just refresh that tab. Okay, it's loading. It says your account is not found or is not available at this time. Please contact technical support. Like when you're trying to – are you using a VPN by chance? No. It didn't even give me the option, like, where – since I didn't delete the stored passwords and whatnot, it should usually just pop up with my username and password. and I just click log in and it goes in, but it's not even showing me the username and password field. Right there is where it pops up and says the account is not found or available. Gotcha. So in your address bar, what's the full website that's up there? www.tcrecruiter.net slash e-c-r-b-i-n slash e-c-r-n-f. dot A-S-P question mark U-I-D equal sign O-D-B-C dot L-O-N-S-K-I. Associates, Lonsky Associates, and signed style sheet, one word, equals default. All right. It looks like you might have an old link there. So what I'm going to do is send you the new one. Okay. Was there an update or something recently? No, but sometimes old links just eventually die. Okay. So let me send you this one. Okay. Oh, excuse me. I got the hiccups. No problem. All right. I just sent that over to Evan at V20recruiting.com. so you should get it here in just a second. Can I see it? Click the link? Yep. Okay. Alright, that opened up in Microsoft Edge. I don't know if that matters. Oh, you can copy the link and paste it into Chrome. Okay, gotcha. It says www.pcrecruiter.net says your account is not available at this time. If you have any questions, please contact technical support. And then it says parenthesis zero colon error parenthesis. All right. Let me take a look at one more thing in the account here real quick. because it sounds like you have something because I can get to your account right away sounds like you have something that's maybe blocking you from accessing it like on your computer okay Just seeing. Have you installed any new programs on your computer recently? No, nothing has changed recently. All right. I'm going to send you a link here to do a quick screen share just so I can take a look and see what is going on. Okay. That way we can check, make sure it's not like an extension or something that you have running causing an issue. Thank you. All right. I just sent that meeting link on over to you. You should get here in just a second. Okay, I got it. It's loading. All right. And then if it asks you to connect your camera or audio, you can just exit out of the box because we're already on the phone here. Okay. And just click continue without audio. and then at the bottom of the meeting window you'll see a blue box with an arrow in it that says share and you'll want to share your entire screen so under the entire screen option you'll just click on which screen you want to share you'll highlight it in yellow and then you'll hit share in that pop-out box. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then can you go to the PCR HTML interface just so I can take a look there? Go ahead and give that page a refresh for me. So it just does the loading there. And then sometimes I forget if it's up here or here, but that green bar will pop up until about halfway. And then I think only one time this morning I've gotten the box with the credentials. All right. Can you click the puzzle piece up in the top right-hand corner for me? Go to manage extensions. All right. So you only got the one. Go ahead and exit out of here for me. And then it's not loading like this for other web pages? the other ones have been fine if I'm not mistaken yeah alright go ahead and exit out of the YouTube page there it popped up now so I did notice that your Chrome is out of date as well okay so that might be causing an issue as well let's see if it lets you log in here are you working remote or are you working in an office working in an office but uh no ethernet okay so you're just on wi-fi okay because like sometimes with internet connections it's kind of like a highway where one lane, like connecting to one website might be fine, but another connection is backed up. So sometimes just restarting the Wi-Fi, the modem and router can help as well. Have you reset your computer at all today or since this has happened? Not yet today. This has been a first for me. I can update Chrome and try to restart it and see if that helps anything. Yeah, let's do that. I don't have access to the modem and the router. Okay. It's behind a lock. Yeah, let's go ahead and do... Yep. So what this will do is just close out Chrome. Yep, you just hit leave. It'll knock us out of the meeting, but I'll have you rejoin after it restarts there. Did I also restart my computer? Or do you want to try it at this point? Yeah, let's try to restart the computer too at this point as well Okay I am doing that now Thank you. Okay, looks like it's doing that good now. Thank you. All right, you want me to go back into the link that you sent me and try to join the meeting again? Yes, please. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. One second. It's just loading super slow. Okay, here we go. Thank you. Alright, it looks like you're popping in there now. Yeah, this screen looks strange and it's still loading. It won't allow me to select anything like where I click out of that box for audio and video. Why don't you try going, go ahead and exit out of the meeting page and try going to your PC recruiter page again. Okay. See the link that you sent me or the bookmark that I had in here? Try the bookmark first. See if that... Okay. Bookmark is just loading. I pasted the other link as well into another window. They're both on the same screen. The login screen loading is still flashing at the top right. Can you try to go and do another web page for me, just like a random? Okay. Interestingly enough, the link that you sent me, it says the same alert. Your account is not found or is not available. and the bookmark page is taking me to the login. So you want me to try to log in again? Yes. Okay. And it looks like other websites are working just fine. And the PCR page is still loading after I put my credentials in. Okay. Can you try joining the screen share again and sharing your screen? Mm-hmm. One second. One second. Okay. The RingCentral link is loaded. When I tried on the edge, it's working perfectly fine, but not on the room. So I got into the meeting, but it was through Edge. Unexpected error occurred. Please contact customer support. That was on the Ring Central. Is the meeting ID 320-700-754? Let me double check here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, 320-700-754. Okay. I'm trying to join again? Yep. Okay. I'm in there now. All right. Go ahead and share your... But again, that's through Edge. Yeah. Go ahead and share your main screen. Okay. All right. Down at the bottom of your screen. Give me two seconds here. I'll move this over. You'll see a little carrot arrow down at the very bottom right. Next, like the time and date. Go ahead and click that. Just want to see. Yeah, keep hovering over the icons. okay that's fine that's good that's fine what's that B1 I'm not sure to tell you the truth can you go ahead and click on that for me yep Yeah, go to where it says show on there. Can you click down into that carrot arrow next to the update for August 11th? Yeah. Just trying to see what Bitdefender is. So that's a security software. The only thing that I could think of that was different over the last couple of days is at my house, and I usually take my computer there over the weekend. I've had some pretty intermittent Wi-Fi problems, but I wasn't actually on the computer. So I don't know if that would have impeded the update process that you see there. But that's the only thing I can think of. Yeah, I'm wondering, so sometimes when product versions like this one, come back to life, they could start blocking certain sites. Can you click that options menu that looks like in the top left-hand corner of this? That one? Yep. Does it give you the option to turn anything off here? like if you click like the on off go to the manage mostly okay so it's not giving you anything there wonder if that's like controlled by your organization perhaps let's try go into PC recruiter like grab one of those links that I sent you. Let's try opening it in Edge. Okay. Yeah, so the same thing's happening there. and this is the one on Chrome still doing the same thing go to the carrot arrow one more time down at the bottom right of your screen right click on that bit defender again go to where it says power user Is it popping up anything? Oh, you can't see it anymore? Sorry. it says do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device product.console.exe yep go ahead and hit okay alright I did that can you see the screen again or no yeah okay we can exit out of that we don't need that I was hoping it would let us turn it off to see if that's yes if the update to that is causing the issue right well it popped right up that time started and now it's got me logged in I don't know how that happened but still everything is loading so slow yeah Let me just... I guess. Yeah, because I'm logging in right away, and everything's loading perfectly fine on my end here. That would be... Yeah, so let's see. It's timing out still. It's letting you in. Let's go to that carrot arrow one more time. We'll just take a look at Windows Defender. Make sure nothing's happening in there. This one? Yep. You can just hit dismiss on that one. But Windows Defender should be pretty normal. Everything in there looks okay. Go ahead and exit out of there. Let me take a look here. if anybody else Now, have you had that Bitdefender on there for a while? Yeah, I think as far as I know, as long as I've had the computer. Yeah, because there's something that... We switched IT departments like loads to a year ago at this point. I haven't had any kind of issues, though. Yeah, because it looks like whatever that update was, it looks like it's blocking the connection. So they might just need to whitelist PC Recruitment. There it is. Can you try just, yeah, but see it's not loading fully up at the top? Right. Okay. Yeah, go into that carrot arrow one more time for me. Mm-hmm. and right click on the Bitdefender and do show. Do I try this? Yeah, go ahead and do that. Do it just like the quick scan. Click the view details. Okay, so this is just going through programs. Okay. Now, does Doug work in the same office as you? He does, but he's out of the office today. Okay. So I was going to say, I just looked and there was a ticket where he was experiencing this issue yesterday as well. Okay. Do you know if he was in the office yesterday? It's hard to say with him. Sometimes he works from home. Sometimes he comes in. I can ask him though Yeah because if he was Working from home And experiencing the issue And he has that Bitdefender as well That's going to give us a pretty good sign there Yeah Or if he was At the office There might be something like With the office connection that'll kind of point us in the right direction. Okay. That's excellent. I think he's occupied right now, but I'll let you know as soon as he responds. The scan. You can still see my screen? Yep. Yeah, so that's good. Go ahead. You can exit over there. Yep. Yeah. So, he put it, he submitted a TICI yesterday, you're saying? Yes. Okay. Okay. Can you try going to Zoom info? I don't have the account credentials to log in. Okay. I just saw the bookmark up there, so I wasn't sure. Yeah. Yeah, because you can see it's still, even that page, it still says it's spinning up there. Mm-hmm. Let's try LinkedIn. LinkedIn. that's the one that has been working as it's supposed to even I think the recruiter side yeah can you try going to the V20 job board alright he just texted me back he said I was, but later in the afternoon, it was fine. All right. So it was late. He was in the office, but... Go to where it says details. Yeah, so there's some sort of network connection that you're having issues with. Okay. Yeah. so my best bet would say if you can contact those it people and let them know like hey i'm having trouble like even your site's taking forever to load and sometimes not connecting and timing out I would ask him about that Bitdefender and see if something changed recently in there. Okay. Because, like you said, if it was just PC Recruiter, I would still think it was Bitdefender. But the fact that it's, like, even when you tried to get to the job board site or load the RingCentral meeting, things were timing out, that means it's a network connection issue. Okay. So call the IT department. Yeah, call the IT department and see if they can take a look at Bitdefender or if they can even reset, like, a lot of times they'll be able to, like, remotely reset, like, the modem and router. Okay. And then kind of go from there. But I'll give you my direct dial just in case you run into any issues after that. Okay. I'm ready when you are. Yeah, it's 440. 772 0670 and especially after hearing 772 0670 yep and it was Tyler right? yep and then especially too with hearing back from Doug like he's like oh yeah later in the afternoon it started working it sounds like an intermittent network issue okay gotcha so yeah give them a call if they give you any flack her, I would just be like, hey, this is what they recommended. I would tell them like, hey, we're having trouble getting to multiple sites and like things are timing out and then they'll be able to handle it from there. Okay, got you. Thanks for your help. I'll let you know. Alright, sounds good. Thank you. Alright, you're welcome. Bye.",
