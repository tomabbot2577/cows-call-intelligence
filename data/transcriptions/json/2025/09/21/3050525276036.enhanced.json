I wanted to give you a quick call just to touch base, return your voice, and I'll make sure that everything was squared away with your PC Recruiter account. I think it is. I saw Robin had been in touch with you, and it looks like you exchanged some emails with her, and it looks like everything is all as it needs to be. but I just wanted to close the loop and confirm that it was. If there's anything else you need or any additional changes need to be made, let me know. 440-856-0314. 440-856-0314. Thanks.",
