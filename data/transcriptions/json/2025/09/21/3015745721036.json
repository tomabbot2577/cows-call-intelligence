    "text": " hello hey john seems to work now you know what i just i did put on that one message i put it in wrong and put the 599 i just found that one it was only the first one but that's the one i had in my system so i just kept dialing the same one still wrong so i've corrected it everywhere now so it's all good okay well ironically enough like i've had other people tell me that same thing that they called me and couldn't get through on my number like so that's why I thought it was the exact same problem but yeah okay I don't feel terrible about yelling at AT&T but I've got a long history with them and it's it's not good and they've done something to deserve it likely even today oh I'm sure I know for a fact that I worked for them for 25 years and they've just kind of done me dirty that's the worst so yeah so I wanted to kind of talk about with dimensional search and the onboarding process of PC Recruiter and everything so we are as you know the software that dimensional search gets you and training kind of goes with PC Recruiter, dimensional search and everything like that so initially what happens the very first thing I do to get things kicked off is I'll send you the paperwork it'll come through like a DocuSign. It's actually PandaDoc, just a different name brand of DocuSign. And at the end of the call today, we'll collect your company name, your street address, which email is proper, and then I'll get that over to you. And then are you just one user? Yes, I am. Perfect. Most everybody is. And are you in the August training class, the August 4th training class? I'm supposed to be in August 4th, yes. Okay. I don't think they're going to change it, but apparently I got a little bit of a late start, so they're kind of scrambling to get everything done in time for August 4th. Okay. Should be. We've got a couple weeks. It should be good because what we do on our end, so you're one user, 50 bucks a month, 750 one-time setup, and that includes setup, database creation. It also includes 10 hours training on our end. So I would email you the paperwork and then once that's signed they'll send an invoice for the setup in first month And then once that's paid The database link is set up and created for you in a day or so. So we do that and Then we get you assigned to one of our trainers So that trainer would get you set up on two to three sessions prior to August 4th Which we still have what two and a half weeks. So should be pretty reasonable that we could do that Okay. And even if it's not, I've had people that have only had one training before them. I've even had a couple that haven't had any before their dimensional search class. So it usually works out okay. So we get some later starters than you. Not a big deal there. And then what will happen is you'll have a couple, a couple, three sessions with our trainer. Then you'll have some sessions with the dimensional searches trainer. And then they'll hand you back to PC recruiter trainer. See they kind of work off each other and the trainings kind of build as you go. Gotcha. So what I can do is, what is your company name? Do you have that yet? What's your street address and all that good information? Yeah. Do you want me to just email it to you, or do you want to? Email is fine. Yeah, pop it over in an email. Then I will generate the paperwork and get that to you today. Okay. I'm very new to this whole everything, running a business. but I'm assuming it is the DBA correct the what I'm doing business at yeah that'll work just fine some people give me both some just do the DBA doesn't matter on our end it'll be that'll be kind of what your database is titled that DBA and that's a street street address associated with it even though we do everything through email we need to have a street address just so we can prove that you don't have to pay taxes because you only have to do that if you're in Ohio so that's how we need to have all that information okay and then I'll email over the paperwork. It's a click, like a general DocuSign. It's PandaDoc, just a different brand. But DocuSign that. Then I'll countersign it. My team will send the invoice. And then they will, once that's paid, the database link will be created and emailed over to you. Okay. I'm typing it up for you right now. Very well. Do you want both of the corporate name and the CPA then, or does it really matter? It doesn't really matter. If you want to send both, many people do. no problem so yeah don't put in my database so it's both and I've had some people do it both some people do it just DBA some people even do it just in their name because they don't yet have their their DBA picked yet so we've done it always okay Again, I apologize for all the mess. No problem. These things happen. These things happen. But now we've got the right number now, so we will be all good now. And like I said, I'll kind of usher you through this onboarding process. We'll have another call with the trainer once that trainer is assigned. run through a few questions about specifics you want to do experience what industry like that and then they will kind of take you and get you trained on the basics of the system for those first two training calls okay address corporate name DBA and I just threw the cell phone number on there Anything else you want on there? That is it, yeah. Just company name, street address, email address. That's really all. Oh, okay. Well, you have the – I don't have the company email address. You're working on that right now. That's no problem. I'm just using my personal ones currently. Yeah, that's no problem at all. yeah I'm leaving on vacation tomorrow for a couple of days so it won't be until next week I think when I've got my appointment to set up the email and all that stuff yeah so if we just send it to your personal email that's no problem and then okay I'll go ahead as soon as you sign it I'll sign it and I'll get the invoice and get the setup underway and get you in queue and get things going okay very well all right we will talk to you soon let me know if there's any questions or anything at all or anything I can do to help yeah we'll talk to you soon okay appreciate it thank you all right take care bye thanks bye",
