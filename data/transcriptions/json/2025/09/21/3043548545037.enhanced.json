    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm calling because one of the – I'm going to try and start an even thing. And I'm warning you, I am trying to describe something where my vocabulary does not meet the needs. No worries. Or my technical knowledge does not meet the needs. Okay. So I'm just going to warn you there. Did I lose you? Hello? Can you still hear me? Hello? But in this case, two users in question. And when I send a form letter as admin, the sender shows up the way that it's supposed to, which is it just says Shelly Herman, and then it says Shelly Herman, or it says her email address. And then when I send a form letter as me, the non-admin user, it shows like, you know, Outlook, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, crazy string of numbers sent on behalf of. And then it says my name and then it says my actual email address. And so the sender shows as this like cuckoo Outlook, you know, fabricated email. And then the reply to does show correctly. and I like to think of myself as somebody who, like, knows to, you know, turn it on and turn it off or, like, check the email settings. So I did that, you know, before calling you guys, and I noticed that the admin email setup in the database has, like, a different – Basically, there's like one thing where she can have the SMTP be directed to our server. And then for the outgoing, there's like a way to authenticate through Microsoft essentially. And then when I log in as me, I only have one little window where it says like email alias. And I only have one place to put an SMTP where the only way it'll send is if I send it through the Outlook SMTP, which is totally fine. and we do want to authenticate through that, but I want it to not show as that, you know, I want it to look like I'm just sending it, me personally. Okay. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? Yeah, let me sign in. It's your username, Margo? Yeah, and it's with a silent T. It's M-A-R-G-O-T, and I'm with Sally Herman and Associates. Perfect. Okay. And I'll just log in here and check on that. So we'll go to email, set up, email alias list. And I'm certain I just don't have something set right. But once I saw that I didn't have the same ability to even put in the same information as the admin one, I thought I'm out of my depth. Okay, yeah. Let's take a look. So let's get on a quick screen share and then I can kind of see the differences that you mentioned there. If I just maybe fire up a meeting with RingCentral here. So if you just want to go in a new tab in your browser to meetings.ringcentral.com. All right. I'm ready for an ID or personal link name at your... Perfect. The ID is 378-144-065. Awesome. I see join there. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Perfect. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Sorry, it's Chrome. Chrome doesn't think I should do this, so I have to go to my settings. I'm sorry about that. Okay, no worries. I'm going to have to quit and reopen the browser. Is it okay to just do the Chrome tab? Sure. Yeah, and if – yeah, we'll try it that way. That'll work. I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean, I will do that. If that doesn't work, I'll quit and relaunch and all of that. I just didn't want to make it. Yeah, this might work here. Okay, so yeah, I'm seeing your PCR pulled up, that tab. So let's jump over to where you were in your settings for, yeah, we'll go to system. Perfect. Would you like to, you're probably faster than I am. I actually don't have like mouse control or anything. I'm just. Got it. Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Okay. So system and then email setup. I'll go to email alias list. Perfect. Okay. I. I wish I had taken a screenshot of my screen, but I promise I called. like maybe, I don't know, a couple hours ago, this didn't exist here. Oh, outgoing mail settings? Wait. Oh, because I'm not in – oh, because I'm in admin. I'm so sorry. Let me log in. I think I know what the difference is. So outgoing mail settings specifically is for your database overall, to have an email address to send just general notification emails. The outgoing mail settings is not tied to any username. It's just your database uses it to send things like somebody requests a password reset. The database needs an email to send through. Your username is tied to your email alias list. That's specific to your... Okay, in that case, the difference that I identified is not the problem. So I will show you, so this is the email alias list that, this is the email that is currently working the way that we want it to work. Okay. Got it. So the mail. Okay. You know, here's all of that information. And I have, let me, so I will go ahead and log in as me to PC Recruiter. And you can see what... Okay. Oh, I felt so clever seeing that difference. Darn it. Okay. No, sorry. So then basically you see this here, and obviously like a clear difference is that my server port is set to the Office 365 instead of the Shelly Herman one. When I set it to Shelly Herman, it won't go through. It won't send. Like when I set it the same way that hers is, it won't send. And now we've reached the end of my knowledge. I'm sorry. Okay, gotcha. No, that's good. That all helps. So the mail server for the Shelly Herman one would mean that your email is hosted on the Shelly Herman website as your as like the mail provider. So they might not have set up for your email address that type of hosting. They might just have you going through Microsoft Office. So let me I'm going to send myself a test email from the Margo username and then see kind of what the recipient sees that you mentioned there. I'll just create a quick name record for myself in your database. Let's see. Okay, I'll put myself under PC Recruiter Company. And I'll do email address here. Okay. So, it may be that I need to talk with the person who hosts our email, in which case, what would I need to do with this Margo address that they did with the Shelley address? They would need to, let's see. And you can also say, I will tell you this if we need to cross that bridge. Oh, gosh, no, that's all right. Yeah, it seems like the SMTP server port field there where it says on the other account says mail.ShelleyHerman. So that would mean that your email provider is tied to the ShelleyHermanSearch.com. So like there's something at your web host or web provider that is providing web mail to the Shelly Herman user. So they might not have Margo at Shelly Herman search dot com as a definitely do. OK. I mean, they are both hosted. They are the same. I created both emails and I created them both in the same way through the same host. Oh, okay. which I know is like not something you did. And I'm not exactly. Yeah, I don't know exactly what it. Let's see. Oh, you know, I did just send an email from myself from the Margo username. And in my inbox, it comes up as your name as the sender. And then it says Margo at Shelly Herman search dot com via Outlook dot com as like the email address. it didn't show any like crazy numbers or letters, me as a recipient. So it kind of seems to be working. Would you be able to forward that to me? Yeah. So that I could see. Let me forward that. Absolutely. I really, I appreciate it. I, you know, you know how it is. It's like the jitters before you do a big outreach and you're doing your test. And then that came through and I was like, no, you will never be less professional than I am. yeah no um from what i can see it does look very professional currently with uh you got a great signature and everything too on that with the with the graphics so let me forward that to you i really appreciate it i mean it's yeah there's so much we can't control you know right we want to get the details right okay yeah so that should be sent your way um the forward there thank you i really appreciate it no problem come on buddy are you taking this long because you know somebody's waiting Sorry, that was me obviously encouraging the email to proceed. There we go. Thank you so much. Yeah, that doesn't look bad at all. I don't know what on earth. I'm so sorry. Would you, this was a form letter? Would you? Oh, yeah, let me do a form letter. I forgot you mentioned that. I just did a general email, but let me try that. Let's see. Is there a specific form letter that you've tested before that I should test again? 302 Recruit First Outreach is one that gave me, gave me an issue. Okay. I found that one. 302 Recruit First Outreach. One of them are recently modified. Got it. Okay. Yep. And let me – oh, it looks like this one has two signatures on it, though. When I go to send it just to myself, there's a double of your graphic there. Let me check. 302 recruit first outreach edit okay here I'll just send it to see if that appears that way one second thank you yes it should Oh, it might be in your email signature settings. You have always include signature and you have your signature built into the form letter. So it's got the signature in the form letter and then it tacks on the always include signature to the email as well. So that might be why it's doubling up. Let me check my inbox to see how that came across. Yeah, it did come across twice. That's so funny. It says always include signature and then in parentheses it says excludes bulk mailing. But I'll go ahead and do select signature for each email. I'm happy to do that. Yeah, let's see if that fixes that at all. Okay, yeah, I did get the double. But the, yeah, okay, so the inbox, it does say just your name again. And then it says, yeah, Outlook next to your name is the sender. And then, yeah, it's just that double signature is the only issue. But, yeah, no crazy numbers or letters or anything in the sending field. And I'll forward that one to you as well. Thank you so much. I don't know if they issue like badges for holding people's hands while they're nervous about non-issues, but if they do. No, no, this is totally good. I would be the same way. make sure that the outgoing bulk email looks right, feels right. So I would be the same way for sure. You know, it's like there's an, I feel like, you know, the battle that we have, you know, with spam filters, with like email fatigue, like anything that you can do, just make it into that inbox and get clicked. You know, you don't want anything against you. Absolutely. Yeah, so now if I'm going to, like, I'm pretending I'm going to resend myself that same form letter, there is only one signature attached there, so that's good. Well, I deeply, deeply appreciate your help, especially since it ended up being just verifying all was fine. Yeah, happy to help. Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much. And, you know, if you know anybody who's passionate about educational equity in Los Angeles, I'd be on TV. I got you. Also, I do want to mention, too, the email signature, that setting we just changed. The other option you have, if you do notice that that that setting makes a difference that you don't like or something, you can always switch it back to always include this email signature and then just remove it from that form letter so that the overall setting is just always tagging, tacking on your signature. But just that form letter doesn't have the additional one in it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Wonderful. Thank you. I really appreciate it. No problem. Have a great rest of your day and definitely reach out if you have any other questions. I will. Thank you so much. You too. Thanks. Bye.",
