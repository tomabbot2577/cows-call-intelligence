    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just enter your name and password. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording. Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. It's James Barella. Hello, James. How are you? Good. How are you doing? Not too bad. Not too bad. Glad you could join me today. Oh, thanks for being flexible. Sorry I'm a little bit late. No worries. Yeah, I just submit one, but we have 30 minutes, so that should be no problem. Great. Well, yeah, so when I was at my previous firm, this was a few years back, we used PCR. So it's on my own now. And after like a few years of just collecting paper resumes and Excel spreadsheets, I was like, you know what, I wish I should have started PCR from the start because now I've got a lot of catch up to do. But anyway, that's kind of where I'm at now. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah. So the version you used before is still around, still available. and we actually now also have a little bit newer, different version called PCRM that is included as well. So you can kind of utilize certainly the old version that you've been used to, that you used those years ago. It's still modern, still used by actually more of our customer base, but you'll also have the new interface, which is a little bit different, a little more modern, also has a sales pipeline, a couple of different things as well. Is there any – oh, go ahead. I felt like with the old one, I was pretty good on it. And although it's been a few years, I still probably need to familiarize myself. I just don't know if I want to take on something very different. How different is it, I guess? quite a bit different and it is something that you don't need to use the new version you can certainly still use the version you were used to uh it's what i use and certainly nothing wrong with it it's modern it's updated it is it is okay it's a good option i just rather stick yeah my brother stick with the old one i think i usually include the uh the newer version just in case you ever decide you want to take a look at it or if a new feature comes and it's in there that way it's already set up for you, but you'd likely only initially use the current version, the PCR nine version, uh, the more stable, not, not the new ones, not stable, but you're used to it. So you're familiar with it. So yeah, I can certainly do something like that. Great. Um, is it just you, just one user? Just me. Um, my old firm, uh, paid for, well, I was just a, I was basically like a 10 99 with them. So I had access to it. So, um, Yeah, it would just be me for now. Okay. Well, our users are $115 per user per month with a one-year commitment. If you go a two-year commitment, it's $105 per user per month. Or if you want to go month-to-month, that's $125 per user per month. So you can kind of choose how long you want to commit. Go to either one of those. And then there's a one-time setup. The setup is $750, and that's going to be what would include creating the new database. that would also include the 10 hours of training on the system that's good for six months if you needed it and it's also going to um on that training they could assist you in parsing in a spreadsheet so if you have data in spreadsheets right now the trainer would be able to walk you through and guide you through parsing that information in to get it all into your system even if you had resumes you could use a resume inhaler to inhale a bunch of paper resumes. If you can scan those in and get them electronic, the resume inhaler will allow you to import them right in, in bulk if needed. Oh, so you could just like on your printer, just scan them and just let it, let it feed it? Yeah. However you, if you can get them scanned in, just scan them into a, like a word folder. And once it's in there, you just point the inhaler at that. Oh, okay. That's, that's pretty cool. Cause I, that's kind of one thing I was dreading was like scanning them all in but I have like I've got a bunch of different folders with resumes already in there so that would be okay that'd be great that's an easier way of doing that and if you have them in word folders or even in folders in your Outlook the resume inhaler is something that can parse from those it'll import them all at once you're not running a Mac are you no okay good because the inhaler doesn't run on a Mac just because what it's designed in doesn't run on a Mac but yeah any any PC you can point it at an Outlook folder or a word folder and just tell it go it'll pull them all in kind of parse them in one right after that just kind of does it in the background as you just wait and then it'll create a record for each one index each resume it's essentially a bulk parse that's going to give you the ability to just point and click and they're all going to be brought in and then spreadsheet data like I said that can be imported as well so that's going to give you some additional options too Okay, awesome. So when you said the $750, is that $750? Yeah, $750. That would cover the setup and all that training. If you wanted, sometimes if you're a returning user, what I'll do is drop it to $600 and go eight hours training, drop a little bit of the training off. It covers more than the training, so I can't wave it all together, but I can do $600 for a little bit less training, save a little money on the front. And then if I do the one year, do I have to pay that $1,000 up front or can I pay it monthly? Oh, the one year, it's $115 per user per month. So up front, you pay $600 plus $115. So what, $715? Pay that up front and then just $115 per user per month. I could split the setup if you want into two payments, $300 the first month, $300 the second month, if that helps. So I could do that too. Yeah, I think that's more palatable. guess so it would be it would be that six so really like the 600 plus the 115 each split that it would just be like 300 300 and then it would be like the 115 from them from there on out yeah you'll be yes would be 300 plus for the first two months plus the 115 so it'll be 415 for the first two months and then just 115 for the rest of the year and therefore because there's no more setup Got it. Okay. Yeah, that would be, and then, so then you, okay, yeah, I mean, let's do it. That sounds good. You can't do any better on the 600? Because I don't think I'm going to use, like, I might have questions along the way, but I don't know that I'm going to need, like, six hours of training. well let's do what if I did 500 set up and dropped it to four hours yeah that seems good that way if I need more I guess I could I could pay as I go but yeah that would be great yeah that'll put four in the bank for you there so that is good so yeah so that'll be 250 plus the 115 for the first couple months because I'll do a toupee of $250 apiece. So that'll be $365 for the first couple of months, and then I'll drop the $115 after those two. And, yeah, what I can do is email over paperwork if you'd like. I have you as Take One Group Executive Search. Is that the proper company name? Yep. And what is the street address? Street address is 7033 Fiddler's Glen. and it's F-I-D-D-E-L-E-R-S, Fiddler's Glen Drive, and that's in Arrington, Tennessee, A-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-N, Tennessee, 37014. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. And I've got, I think I've got your email. So we've exchanged. Oh yeah, jvorella at takeonegroup.com. So what I'll do, I can put that together, email the paperwork to you. That'll be, it'll come through like a DocuSign style agreement. It's actually PandaDoc, just a different name brand. And once you sign that, then I will put in a ticket. I'll countersign it. I'll get a ticket in to have my accounting team send over the initial invoice for half of the setup in the first month. As soon as that's paid within a day or two, everything's going to be set up and ready to go. So you'd be able to get training underway very shortly after, import your data, and start using. So you'd be starting using real quick. Okay, and then one question with the – if I have duplicate resumes, will it put it in there as like the same name but two resumes? Or I guess it'd probably just be two different people, right? Not that I'll have that many of those. Usually, if you have two resumes, it'll recognize it's a dupe. And it'll A, if it's the exact same resume, it'll skip it if you're doing an inhale. Or if you're parsing it manually, it'll tell you you already have this identical resume, so there's nothing really new. However, if it sees it's a different resume linked to a name and email that's already in your system, it'll give you a little option to update the existing resume and archive the current resume. So it'll still keep one record. It'll just update that primary resume to the new one, archive your old resume, and it'll just kind of move it through that way. So it'll be handled, and it gives you a couple options depending on what happened with the resume, whether it's the exact resume or if it's something different there. Okay, and then if you guys all get hit by a bus or go out of business, like what – how do I – do I have any recourse to get the data back? Well, the data is all yours. You retain ownership of the data and you can at any time request a data return. So even if you want to in six months, once you've got some data in there, request a data return. I think they charge like $175 for it, but they would make it available to you. You can download it and keep a copy of the data anywhere you wish. That way you have a SQL database should you ever need it. So you have a copy in your pocket or you can at any time export a list of information out into an Excel. So you can kind of keep that downloaded manually to your machine. And that is something you could do anytime, no cost. So you can get it out in Excel or request a formal SQL data file. Usually when someone sends me the resume, I put it into a folder anyway, and then I would put it into PCR. So it would be like, so when I import these folders, they don't disappear from my desktop, do they? Don't they just like, do I make a copy and send it in? Or if I input it, does it disappear on my desktop? Nope. What it'll usually do, if you use the resume inhaler, it's going to automatically create a kind of a subfolder set, and it'll move it into a different folder that is either imported, duplicate, or bad. So it'll kind of just tell you whether it was imported. It just moves it into a different folder called imported, but it's still there. So you still have it there wherever it originally was, but it's also going to import and create the record in PC Recruiter. Okay, cool. All right, let's do it. okay and did you want me to include the PCRM there in no additional cost you'll just have it if you needed it if you ever wanted to explore it or use it I could have it created for you so what's the over I thought the old version was PCR but is the old version just what it's pretty normal yeah I'm gonna get you the PC recruiter 9 so the PCR okay CRM is the new version it's a PCR it's It's a CRM product. That's why it's called PCRM. So that's going to add some different stuff. It's a different format. Maybe someday I want to take a look at it. Yeah, that's fine. Sure. It's included. It will be a different link. I'll set it up. But I'll note that you want to really, since you've used it, you're already familiar. You're trained on PCRecruiter 9. Yeah, perfect. For sure. Okay, very well. Well, let me get that sent over in a little bit, and then I'll circle back in a couple days if I haven't heard anything from you. just to make sure, but yeah, just sign that. We can get everything rolling as soon as you're ready. Awesome. Thanks, Jim. All right. Thank you. We'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye. Take care. Bye now.",
