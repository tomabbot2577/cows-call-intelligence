    "text": " Hello? Hey, so yeah, we have somebody on the line here. Awesome. Yeah. Oscar, are you there? Yes, I am. Excellent. Not at the beach, but I am here. All right. Yeah. So, and Garrett, you're still there? yes cool I just want to make sure I parked that call and I've never done that before and I just kind of made up how to get it back because I didn't know how to get it back but there it was so it worked um yeah so I wanted to um kind of introduce Oscar you to Garrett he's going to be your trainer here PC recruiter so um he's going to be the one that's going to get you up and running on the system generally we'll do a couple to three sessions before your dimensional search training. So we will kind of go through and get those scheduled at the end of the call today. I'm going to, we are going to run through a quick question, a quick couple of questions for you about how you want to use the system, some of the add-ons you want to set up since your dimensional search. We already know some of them this time, so we know some of the basics there. But I'm going to be a person, if you ever need to add a user, drop a user, or if there's anything and you don't know who to talk to, reach out to me, and I can either help you or get you to someone who can. Garrett's going to be the one to get you up and running and trained on the system. He's going to work hand-in-hand with the team over at Dimensional Search to get you trained on here. So I will turn it over to Garrett to go through the questions and get the first couple of trainings on the schedule. So I'll go ahead and turn that over to Garrett. Nice to meet you. So yeah, I'll be your trainer, like Jim mentioned, and the way it works with Dimensional Search is I'll take a the trainings where I'm showing you how to use the software. And then I'll pass you over to dimensional search for some more of the, you know, philosophy behind recruiting. And then they'll pass you back to me. So we'll just bounce back and forth during this full training process. So let's start here with some of these questions. What industry will you be recruiting in? So the industry is human resources software. Perfect. Okay. And then have you used any recruiting software before PCR or even like an Excel spreadsheet or something like that to track things? No, it isn't. Okay. Got it. And then are you going to have any other admin users on your PCR database or maybe bring them down the line, some more admin users? Right now it's just an army of people. Got it. All right. And then what operating system do you use, a Windows or a Mac? Windows. Perfect. And then your preferred browser, are you using Chrome or Edge? Meter.gov. Okay, so for PCR, you'll have to use either Chrome or Edge for PCR to function, as well as our PCR capture tool, which is kind of a browser extension that allows you to grab people from places like LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, and then bring them into the database. So I would recommend either installing Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for use with PCR. And then let's see, who is your email provider? Is it like a Microsoft Office or Gmail? Yeah, so I use Microsoft Edge. Oh, perfect. Along with my . Gotcha. Okay, so Microsoft Edge, I'll make a note there. And then you can say you use Outlook as your provider for email, Microsoft. And then so Dimensional Search does usually recommend or set you up with HireEasy as a third-party tool, ZoomInfo, and then even RingCentral as a phone system. Are there any other ones that you've heard of or plan to use for your recruiting? So I heard of nven.ai, the company. It's similar to Zoom Info. Without the Zoom Info, this kind of rate is much cheaper. I received a memo yesterday and I haven't received one yet from Zoom Info, but I am scheduled to get a call with them shortly. Okay, cool. But I do think that in the future I might go with either placing one more together or just adding Inven to my repository. Okay, cool. And what was that AI one you said? Can you spell that? Inven, I-N-V-E-N, Inven, like inventory. Oh, okay. .ai. Awesome. All right. And then let's see, do you have a website that you plan on using where you can post jobs for people to apply to? Yes. So it's being built, but the domain is a company name, Trustform.ai. Perfect. Okay. So we will cover that in our training. It's called the Job Board feature, where you basically create positions in your database, and then they'll show up on your website through the Job Board so people can apply. Awesome. I'll just mark down that the website might not be fully ready yet, but that's quite all right. Okay, I think that's all the questions I have. Let's schedule the first two trainings now, and then after that I'll pass you over to dimensional search. Let me pull up my calendar here. What time zone are you in? We're on Eastern. Correct, Eastern. Okay, good. That'll be easy then. All right. All right. So I have a lot of openings starting next week, the 14th. Is there a day that you prefer? All right. So I have my, yeah, I could do Tuesdays. Oh, okay. Tuesdays between, I don't know, but I got my potential first days with Christine, Aireen, from Tennessee, and Bernie. Maybe we could do Tuesdays from, I don't know, 11 to 12? Or how much time do you need for the training? Each training will be an hour long. I have basically the slots I have are the 10 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday. Would either of those slots work? No. So that's going to end with Monday. Monday? Yeah, that's Monday training. Okay. So, yeah, 10 a.m. on Monday. Would that one work? Yeah. Okay. So that's the 14th. All right. And I will send you an invite email to that. And then let's get one more on the calendar. How about starting with Wednesday or maybe Thursday or Friday? Anything good there? Wednesday, 10 o'clock. Awesome. Okay, and that's the 16th. Perfect. All right. Yeah, I'll send you an invite to both of those, and then we'll go from there. Let's see. That'll be good. Okay, awesome. Any questions that you have for either me or Jim? I do. So I received my data set from Dimensional Search. And I was supposed to get back with their team. And they asked for my username and my password. Sorry, my username and my account. I know I made the payment last Thursday, if I'm not mistaken. But after that, I don't know if I have access to the PCR. like for installing it. I don't know what else to do. Oh, okay. Yeah, let me double check and make sure you have a web address here. Yeah, here, let me send you, I can either email it to you or put it in the chat of this meeting here, your login link. Send it through my email, that way I save it. You can send it at offer at trustform.ai. Okay. Trustform.ai. All right. And I'll make sure that they sent you that email with your username and password, your temporary one that they set you up with. If they haven't, I will get that information over to you. But yeah, so we'll get you that. It's just a login link, username, password, and you'll be able to open up PCR and look around and see some of the things that Dimensional Search has uploaded into that database. Okay. I do have a Dimensional Search training with Augustine tomorrow. I told him that, you know, I asked him about the two or three questions before. I guess he's pretty eager to just do the intro, so I'm not sure if that's okay or what to expect from that one. No worries, yeah. No, that's quite all right. We might kind of review some of the things that you talk about on that first training with dimensional search. We might hit some of the same topics. But, yeah, that's totally fine. They'll give you a good overview, and then we can get into the nitty-gritty of the actual software on our trainings afterwards. So the order isn't too crucial. Okay. All right. Other than that, yeah. So you said that the two or three sessions kind of, right. So I'm very new, obviously I'm new. I'm onboarding still. I'm in the industry itself. On the civilian side, my experience with moving into the military, about 23 years as a professional, and about my 23 years as a professional, I've done career counseling, recruiting and retention management. Okay, cool. Kind of like, you know, instead of going out there and seeing jobs with people with talent, I will move soldiers to units, depending on their position description, their evaluation, kind of like a proxy, so to speak. So the skills are there. But as far as like the terminology, I'm very involved when it comes to like knowledge. So what I'm trying, that's the content behind what I want to say is my profile, I would like for it to mirror that of, I don't know if it's my coach, Clark Young. I don't know if that's too much to say or like I know you just said that my profile is like a starter package. but I just don't know if that's going to leave things out that eventually I'll need to add on. So I don't know if your experience with working with startups is more like a one-size-fits-all or can I tailor it right now to kind of mirror that of my business coach, Clark Young, with my research? Sure, yeah. we're going to go through all the different ways you can customize your database to make it look and feel how you need it. So you're seeing, you know, the information you need right at the top when you look at a record. Yeah, various things we can customize. And so we will cover that in training. I personally am not able to look at another customer and, you know, mirror their settings into your database. But if you, you know, have a relationship with them or your coach, You can say, you know, let me see your setup, and then you will know how to change your database to mirror that. But just for security purposes, I can't, you know, give you the layouts from other customers. But it sounds like you're already, you know, in contact with that coach, like you mentioned. So that'll be great. And then the last, I do want to clarify what you asked me about the industry. My industry is HR software technology. Okay. And that's not the technology, but more like connecting cloud-based skills professionals to help digitalize the HR software industry, the HR system industry and whatnot. So like, think about your brain flow, think about your software. Some HR managers and whatever software they use, technology that they use, can carry out the functions. So that's my industry, HR software technology. Okay, gotcha. That makes sense. I have that updated now. Let me save that. Okay, perfect. Awesome. That is good on my end. Any other questions that you have for us? No, I guess I'll see you Monday, Friday, or when I'm writing early, but early morning, and then we'll start training. Awesome. Yeah. And I will get back to you via email with your login credentials. Great. Looking forward to it. Awesome. All right. All right. Well, thank you all for being very responsive and looking forward to the training next week. Sounds great. You too, Darrell. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",
