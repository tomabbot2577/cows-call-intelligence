    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Erica Stern. I have been trying to figure out how to link my email to my PCR. I believe I've done it, but I'm not getting the auto-updates on the activities tab in the way I expected. So I'm wondering how I can fix that. Let's see. hold on one I was and I'm so sorry what is your name again Erica Stern S-T-E-R-N E-R-N okay Erica's with a C that's right E-R-I-C-A-S-T-E-R-N what is the company Ascend Attorney Search LLC okay let's see why don't I have you yeah we don't have you in here yet okay um let me add you in okay erica s-t-e-r-n what is your email address e stern at ascend a-s-b-e-n-d attorney search dot com okay what's your phone number just in case i get disconnected 248 505 4392 Now what did you set up for did you do portal or were you doing PCR mail? So I let me see email so I linked my Eastern, like linked my Outlook to PCR emails and settings via the configure. I watched a training video to do it. So there's like you have to set up where you can email from PCR, but as far as getting any kind of like incoming email, you would have to have either the PCR portal add-in or for Outlook, the PCR portal added for Outlook or a PCR mail setup? Do you know if you did either one of those? Or did you just go to like email setup? I just went to email setup. Okay, and you're an alias address list, I assume then? I'm so sorry. I don't know what that means. So if you were in PC Recruiter, did you only go to system, email setup, and then click email alias list? I'm assuming yes. I'm having trouble answering that. Okay. And you're, okay. I'm looking at the username. Your last name is Stern, S-T-E-R-N, right? N as in Nancy, that's right. Okay, I wrote M on mine. Okay, let's see what you did here. Let's see, Eastern is your username. Oops. You want to get, where you can send an email but also get incoming, So I couldn't write activities? Yeah. So I was under the impression that if I use my Outlook as I normally would and the email that I have associated with a candidate is the same one that I'm corresponding with via Outlook, that PCR would pick up on that and put it in the activities. Only if you set up one of the integrations. Okay. Let me see. Okay. Okay. All right. So here's what I'm going to have you do. it's very very top right a piece your recruiter there's a gear icon and it floats up on the edge of your user oh actually have part of it done hold on one second let me see hold on okay hold on hold on there's only part of it done and I'm gonna let's see why do we not have folders for you interesting why is this showing up under personal all right I'm going to delete out this setup because something's not right here and this is your main account right okay I'm going to go under mail servers and delete the setup that's there something is off with it I don't know what it's not even giving me the folders um okay let's do this you happen to have ring central by any chance um I do not I don't think okay is that something else you get while we're on the phone I'll just do a a what do you call it what's it called a google meet instead okay so let me google meet okay Sending you a meeting link. Great. Okay. I'm going to join the call. Okay. When you join, either mute or don't join by computer audio and you won't need camera because we don't need the phone. I mean, sorry, we don't need the audio because we're You're just using it for like a screen control? Yeah. I'm like literally getting an email every two minutes. Oh my gosh. I can't keep up with it. That is overwhelming. I don't know what it is about Monday. It's like a little insane here. Okay, I joined without audio or... Okay, perfect. Okay, so what I'm going to have you do is share your screen. So what you'll do is share screen, but make sure you select entire screen, which is going to be over to the right. okay sorry give me just a second it's asking to record all of this and that doesn't make sense oh that's basically how your computer words um allowing to share your screen they use the word record got it not really not really recording okay allow later. Okay. Let's see if that works. I want to share entire screen. Open system. Oh, you're on a map. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Just a second. Okay. Quit and reopen. Leave. yeah quit everything I don't care okay so I have to go back to that invite and join again to kick you out yep okay should be back entire screen why can I still not share why can I still not share this is ridiculous entire screen yeah if I go to oh here we go all right okay ignore that this is going to mirror and stuff like that I'm going to have you go over to piece of a critter so you don't want to close this window you just want to minimize that meat screen otherwise if you close it I'll kick you out yep problem okay All right. Okay. So what I'm going to do is click on that gear icon at the very top right. Go to email. Okay. Go to configure. Are you a new user? Yes. Okay. So it sounds like you're going to have a whole bunch of folders and everything. Okay. All right, let's go to mail servers. Yeah, something's off with the authentication then, it seems like. Okay, on the left side, it is still listing that. Yeah, but we're not getting any folders, which is kind of odd. Okay. Now, if you had a ton of emails, like somebody the other day was like, well I have a 20 years of emails and folders it's like my god yeah I don't delete anything I'm like well that's gonna take forever so yeah no I do not usually yeah usually we get the folders right away um so see where it says action down at the bottom yep just hit uh delete okay is that even deleting yeah it won't even delete what are we doing sometimes i gotta go in and out here let me see what's going on here why is it something's off with that okay let's just try a new one to replace that we're just going to use different stuff so hit the plus sign that's next to mail servers. Let's just, oh I wonder, no, okay. This we just got a clear cache I believe. Can you close out of here for a moment? Go to the three vertical dots at the top right of your browser. Go to delete browsing data. Down to more spots. Where it says delete browsing data, switch that to all time. Uncheck browsing history and cookies, only delete cached images and files. And then hit delete data. Oh, you got 1.1 gigabits. Okay, that was kind of surprising. Okay, let's close all PCR screens and then go back in. Okay, let's go to the gear. I saw one at the top right. Go to email. why is that even being listed no it's not down below anymore okay it's actually there though let's see it's not down below anymore yeah you're not under emails either or mail server I'm going to try deleting from my side, see what happens. Okay. Okay. Okay, I got it gone. All right, I'm going to have you close this PCR mail tab, and then we're going to go back in. So go to the gear icon. No, no, no, no. Hey, cancel, cancel. Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just want you to close the PCR mail tab. So you're going to go back to PCR. All right. Okay. So go to configure. It looks different. Yeah. Click mail servers. Click the plus sign. Okay. Where it says description, just call it my email. It doesn't need to be that lengthy. Where it says save sent email to sent items folder, change that from yes to no and then for the rest of the details click sign in with Microsoft and that is your credentials right hit test connection Perfect. Exit. Click save, but only click save once. Do not double click it. And then here say no thanks. Okay. Let's exit this mail server screen. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Didn't we save? Hold on one second. Didn't we save? Hold on one second. Go back to where it says that row. Go to Action Edit. Just want to make sure. Did I have you do everything? Hit Test Connection one more time. Okay, good. All right. Exit and close this area. Okay, let's go to Email Folders up at the very top. And then scroll down under My Emails. Is it giving you anything? Okay. No. Do you know if they have gone into your Office 365 account and enabled IMAP as well as SMTP authentication? I do not know. Because it seems to be in addition with your account. Would that be on my employer's side? Yeah. Basically, whoever sets up your emails, they might need to go into the mail settings and make sure that IMAP and SMTP authentication are enabled for you. And that could be why it's not. And SMG. SMTP. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Because I don't know. It's like not getting the folders for some reason. Okay. And that means it's also probably it's just not. Like, can you open up your, I look like you don't have any folders with any, like, weird names or anything, right? Oh, no, I don't think so. Let's see. These are my folders. Can we take the ampersand symbol maybe out of folders? I wonder if that could be causing. Maybe just make it T-E roll just for simplicity or something. Sure. Either way. I could have sworn like I've seen some character in the past before. And I just want to make sure. That messed it up. Yeah. Would the dash do it? I thought it was like a weird symbol I've seen once where it gets hung up trying to pull folder names. Hmm. Still nothing. Let's go back to mail servers. Let's go to action and select edit. just try sign in with Microsoft again just to make sure and then hit save it's active those folders gotta be some back-end error going on that we're not seeing here. I still won't do it. Can we exit out of here for a moment? I'm going to do this again. Go to action, delete. Okay, let's click add. And I want to just keep using unique names. Type in 0365 for the description. Save sent email to sent items folder, switch to that to know. And then sign in with Microsoft. You know what, don't save this yet. I want to do something else. Let's exit out. Right click on your Chrome extension, I'm sorry your Chrome app or like go up there and actually is it in there as well? Yeah go in right click and say new incognito window. Okay now you've got your shortcut for PCR at the top. Basically this doesn't remember any sign in. I just want make sure we're getting all the prompts that we need to. Okay let's go email configure mail servers let's click that plus symbol and this time we'll just use office just trying to make sure it's unique save sent email to sent items folder and then let's click try sign in with Microsoft at this time it should not remember the sign-in I want to make sure we're getting prompted the right way. Put in your email address. Did it prompt you like work or school account? No. Okay here I guess hit yes I guess that's up to you it's up let's hit test okay exit and then save I don't know what's going on here why are we not getting folders. Well you might have to just make, I don't know what's going on. We're not getting your folders for some reason. Yeah and that might be an issue with securities within your office 365 which you and I would not have access to too. Can you ask them to confirm if it's set up enabled IMAP? It looks like SMTP authentication might be. I'm kind of surprised if IMAP wouldn't. I know everyone else at my office does use this setup. If you're on a Mac, this is your only option. Okay, let me text my boss and see if IMAP is enabled. If it takes a bit for her to get back to me, have we exhausted all our tries here? That's the only thing I can think of. I mean, I was thinking maybe it was like the folder names and the get stuck trying to get those folder names, but you've changed those. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Go in there. Go in there again. Was there like a folder? Go back over your email. Oh, this was an email. That was my OneNote. But here's my email. Okay. This is a subfolder, like sub-sub. I thought I saw like a plus. Was that under something else, though? Yeah, that was in my OneNote. This is my OneNote. It's my email. Okay. That's what Allie plus Laura. That's what I was seeing. Okay. Let's go expand underneath candidate materials. What's under there? that's just the load T&E role. What about Canada's no role? Although I think it... It doesn't have a subfolder. It's just email. I don't think it does. And not even a lot of them. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure why it's not getting the folders. Okay. So I need to make sure IMAP is enabled. Mm-hmm. But that's not something I can do on my end. That has to be whoever is running AscendAttorneySearch.com. Right. Okay. Yeah, because right now it's just not giving us the folders. It's testing okay. Right. and once I get the folders is that does that mean it is synced more or less I'm sorry once I get the folders does that mean it will sync um I have well no but then we'd have to set what is the sent folder and then what is the trash folder which is another step but I can't do that until this folder name show and that's when it really starts thinking got it and you said the you said that the SMTP authentication is confirmed I don't need to ask about that I wouldn't think I would have them double check it usually what will happen when if they don't go in and select it what happens is when you go to your alias address list which is your settings for sending an email that when you hit test connection it will say SMTP He's disabled for the tenant. And I didn't see that. So it's kind of surprising. I thought, well, for sure, then that would be off. I didn't get that issue, though. So that's kind of, again, why I'm surprised. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, while we're waiting for this, is there just like a direct number or a – Is there a way I can reach you via extension? My extension is 5466. Or you can just shoot me an email, robin at main sequence dot net. Because if they say it is, then I'm going to have to have someone look at a backend server that I don't have access to and see if there's anything there that could indicate what kind of error might be happening. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. All right. No problem. Thanks. I will contact you once I have more answers. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye-bye.",
