    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. It's Mary Barker from Traverse City. Hi. How are you? I'm doing well. I wanted to get back with you. Sorry it took me a couple days. Doug said that we should be satisfied that you guys have automatically taken the money from the credit card that we had on file with you. yeah so what happened there was quite a few of our customers that never set up the card in the new system so we just really had no choice but to go in the old system and process it even though that's what we didn't really want to do um because we want people set up in the new system oh okay well it's fine right now yeah it is current well we have decided just we just want to close it. I mean, we see no reason to keep it. We don't have any intention of working and we tried to sell and nobody seemed to want it and we're moving on and having fun in our life. Okay. So the thing that I was asked to ask you was then about the data. Do we just delete it or do you want to do a database backup? There is a fee for the database backup or should we just? Doug, we don't need any of that data, do we? Yeah, no. Well, she asked if we wanted to do a database backup. We don't see any reason for it. Just get rid of it. Okay. It was a good 49-year haul. Wow, crazy. How was your concert? it was good it was a friend's grandson it was just so hot we we could only stay about an hour and a half it was because it was an outdoor thing it was so hot that you couldn't even in the shade you couldn't breathe so muggy hot i don't know where you are but we have had it's been so muggy oh just horrible we're supposed to go out on a catamaran today with a group and now it's been raining all morning and but they we call it two o'clock and they're like oh no the rain should be done by two o'clock and i'm like well there's any signs of lightning i'm not going out on a boat I'll tell you that much. Yeah. But anyway, yeah. I'll hit, so the database is already off. So I'll just let them know that the data return is not needed. Okay. And I'll make this effective immediately then. Sound good? It sounds good. And Robin, where are you located? Cleveland area. In the Cleveland area. Okay. So you guys have had kind of the same kind of, I mean, we've had a beautiful summer. It's just the last couple of weeks, you can't breathe. It's so hot and muggy. Yeah. It lasted a little bit better, but it's like back to it again this week. Yeah. We'll be happy when there's three feet of snow on the ground. And I just read yesterday that, at least for us, because we're in northern Michigan, not the UP, but northern Michigan, northern lower, that they're expecting a much earlier snowfall this year. It could be as early as the end of September. Now, I'm not ready for that, I'll tell you. Oh, no. No, no, no. I'm going to extend summer as much as possible. I've kind of been like a little bit. That's right. With my husband lately. Yeah. We're about to go back to college and summer is almost over. And I'm like, every three days, I'm like, we've got to go do something. Summer is going to be over. Summer's going to be over. I know. I know. We have one daughter, and she has two little boys that we dote on and cherish, and they're five and seven, and they start school right after Labor Day. And their camps, they've gone to day camps, different day camps throughout the summer, and they're done at the end of this week. So I said, they texted this morning and said, do you want the boys at all next week? I said, are you kidding me? I want them as often as I can get them. And I'm in my mind going, what can we do before they have to go back to school? And, you know, they grow so fast. Oh, yeah. So fast. So anyway, it's great to live close to them and be able to see them often and spoil them. You know, we just spoil them rotten, and that's what we're for. but they're not rotten kids though but we do we do indulge them that there's no doubt about it we knew we would though we waited a long time to get those little munchkins okay well thank you so much robin you have a fun rest of the summer good luck with your kiddos going back to college thank you remember those days too not easy no not at all. All right. All right. Thank you very much. All right. You're welcome. Now, will I get something? Will you email me something? Yeah, I just got to figure out how I want to do this because it's actually with your previous email. So I'm just going to figure out what I'm going to do here. I don't want it to lose. Here, I'll do it that way. I'll do it with a new email. Okay. I will get this done. All right. Thanks, Robin. All righty. Thank you. All right. Have a good day. You too. Bye.",
