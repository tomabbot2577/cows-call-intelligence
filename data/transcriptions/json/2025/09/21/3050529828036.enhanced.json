    "text": " Hello? Hello. What are you doing? Hi. Working. I just left Tina Roberts a message. She was on my voicemail, but I just wanted to close the loop and make sure she was set. But she is all squared away, isn't she? I voided the July one. I don't know if maybe like thought that was like a second user or something, but apparently she only has one. So I'm not really sure why there was a six-month invoice covering like two rows of the same thing and then the next one was six months later. So she already paid that one in January, which she did. I deleted the one in January, July. I do have the next one going in, was it December or January, January 1st again, only because I think it's better to stick with the six months for now. because then it aligns more with the contract date because if she prepays and then cancels, then there's six months that, you know what I mean? I do. Excuse me. So because she replied, like, it doesn't matter if it's six months or a year, but at least the next one I'd rather do is six months because it's harder to align with contract dates. Otherwise, it gets really messy doing a prepay annually. Mm-hmm. I don't know what he's talking about. It's a bug. It's fucking it up. I don't need to go through 59 steps. It looks like shit. It's a bug. Yeah, if you send a form letter, it merges, like, whether it's pipeline email or name letter, and you have it merging in summary, it's adding all this extra spacing. Ooh. Yeah, it looks like shit. so you can have it look perfect in your summary and then when you go to email it it's got all this extra spacing for some reason that's so good so it's like a lot of clean up looks like shit I don't know I hate PCRM it opens the same window it's the same HTML code it's the same window doesn't make a difference so anyway I wanted to show you can I do a meeting with you what I did. You can tell me if you like it or if you don't. No offense. I just thought it might be a little bit easier for me because I'm only going to do this for you once a month for me to remember. It might be easier for both of us. Yeah. Open up your RingCentral and I'll give you a meeting ID. Actually, just put Robin Mantone all as one word. Open up my RingCentral. Oh, but it has to be new RingCentral, doesn't it? yeah I use the old interface because the new interface I just don't like oh really oh get everything on one place so much better I don't know how to get into it now and your windows search just type the word ring and it'll just say ring central with the word app underneath it app got it okay yeah that's the one it opens for me oops so it's still up in the old one that is the website I don't need the website I don't know what he's gonna show you what I mean it doesn't matter it's a template it's merging it in shitty I don't know I don't need to change my process for something that doesn't work I don't know what I'm Do you want to just do a Google Meet? Yeah, let's do a Google Meet. Okay. Hold on one second. Return to meeting. Hold on one second. Let's see. Meet. New meeting. Start an instant. There you go. Meanwhile, I will start to share my screen. Ask to join. okay okay all right so let me find what I did with it hold on one second close close oh that was yours original that's okay so I only did like two rows as an example we might want to do some tweaks because I just want to see if this if you even like this if it would even work drive okay so I made this thing and we could just call it whatever because I think you could probably just like copy as a new tab or whatever if you want to do like like duplicate or you know what I mean make a tab a month yeah if you wanted to or just replace it oh let me fix the spelling of this okay so here's what I did you would just have to list in here how you normally do then all you have to do is what was the upgrade fee or like like a one-time kind of thing so this one like I just did like two examples from your your sheet so that's if my formulas work that was a setup there's going to be one user $50 a month and then this will automatically calculate for six months for you oh cool cool so you can just say like oh they're going to be two users and then I see how it changes to 600 for you mm-hmm or if I do three users for 75 and that way is then it then it take this amount and and then this amount and calculates it here. Oh, the total. Okay. So that way you don't have to worry about that. And if it's easier for you, this is no extra work for me, so I think it's certainly a good idea. It might just be a little bit clearer, like how many users, what's the – now this would be – at first I had it where you just put one amount, but then I'm like, eh, maybe we'll do like three users. And that way we could always see, like two users, 50 a month. Actually, this one might be a little bit weird because this is the one I was getting a little more concerned about. Like it's always six months, right? Or do we want a column for how many months? Always six months. Okay. No matter what, it's always six months. Okay. Now this is the one where I got a little thing where we just did like a refund. Yeah, and that almost never happens. Okay. It's happened two months in a row now, but in 20 years it's probably only happened two times ever before. Okay. So I guess if anything, just put something over here if you want to. Yeah. Okay. Okay. That looks very good. Do you like that? Okay, because then what it does, and you can keep kind of going, you know what I mean? I don't know how many rows you want, but then what it'll do is it'll take these numbers and say that's the total of, so it's going to total this. See, that's like G8 to G99 or whatever it says. It'll take these values, total them for you. So that should be the less 310. automatically calculates this number here by 25, so taking B1 times 0.25, there's your commission. If this number is over 7,500, now is it greater than an equal or it just has to be greater? 17.5 or more. So if it's 17,500 or higher. Okay. So would that do it? Okay. Okay, I think that'll do it. Maybe let's just do a couple to make sure. Example one, example two. We'll just do some big ones here. New. We'll just do like 750. and we'll pretend like five five eight ten twelve yeah that never happens okay we're gonna go 115 we're selling big now huge okay so see how it just calculated so then that should have driven this up now what happened here shit okay um if b2 no this should be if your total deals right yeah it's more yeah okay so that needs to be one not b2 okay yeah that doesn't seem right All right, I got to fix that. Hold on one second. Okay, commission this. If B1... greater than no that's wrong hold on one second I guess that's $99. Then what were you getting on that? What was that? You got an extra 500? 500 yeah adds 500 if it's 17 5 or more Oh, shit. Oh, I need the equals symbol. Oh. Hold on one second. Let's see. So since this is now more than 500, that adds 500. Now let's take these rows off. That zeroed it. Yep, that's good. Okay, did it. And that should be this, okay, but this needs to be formulated that way. And bold. Okay, do you like? I do. I like it. I'll certainly use it. And it's just a Google Doc that I can get to, we can both get to? Yeah. Cool. That looks good. I shared it with you. I have no worries with it at all. I think it's good. And if it's easier on you, it's no more work for me, and it's easier. It calculates everything for us, so that's good. I like it. Let's see if LinkedIn access. Okay. So that can do it. Sounds good. I hope this stays the same I think you should yeah I was like oh because I was going through your thing and I'm like yeah it does the math and it's easier to figure it out yeah and then all you should have to do is just kind of come down here and then like fill out what you want to do delete cells and search away I want to clear like what if I happens if I take these out does it ruin my cells okay let's add one example new 750 70 115 see it kind of lost my formula okay I got to figure out how to lock the formulas in well we have a couple of weeks because I I've only got one thing in this month so far so I can add it later okay but I think if you did like a copy row and then edit it would work I just want to so it's stays you know what I mean yeah I just got to figure it out and I usually do a copy row too so that's good unless I do that where I just put this stuff at the right I don't know this would be easier seeing it up at the top I don't know yeah I think it is better up at the top um I'm gonna call Kathleen Laney to see what she's all about she wanted a data return is that was that her deal yes so I'll check and see why she wants it and if she wants to look at PCRM or what's going on. PCRM, yay. PCRM. One, the name, I don't know. But two, it needs a lot of work. It's very hard on the eyes. Some people like it, but I like nine better. There's just so much wasted space. Like when I'm looking at this, I'm like squinting. big monitor small monitor i i'm squinting and i also don't like that i have to i can't like click here like i keep having to go i have to go in this one spot oh to scroll through yeah or to click you have to click that little icon yeah i keep having to go to the left even though i might be over here i'd rather be able to like scroll over here can i do that now you just have a little buck a little bubble the arrows come up over around the little circle. Oh yeah. That's those. Yeah, again, very little hidden spot. Yeah, a lot of things. I just learned that if you happen to select all, well you can't select all, you have to say select range one through 100, but then you also have to click a little unmarked button that says apply range in order for it to work. Like I mean, how would I have ever known that? Huh, I didn't even try to do too much. If you, like if you look at these people, Click the, like you want to select the whole list right there. And if it happens to be more than, I don't know, eight, I don't know, you have to hit, if you want to select a range. So if you hit that again and you want to do select range, type in one through 100 or whatever. But you also have to click, there's a tiny little arrow like right next to where you just put in 10 or whatever. There's a teeny tiny little arrow that you have to click to apply or it doesn't apply. like I was like how the hell would anyone know that or when you do the boolean search you have to select additional search all content boolean type it in you can't just hit search you have to add first and then hit search and why are we limiting to a thousand yeah and a little quirky things like that Why is Jim Lye still doing work? He kind of volunteers for us a little. I don't know. I wasn't getting paid. He's not getting paid, and he just checks his email every day or so, and he sends stuff to me periodically and stuff like that. But, yeah, he's not getting paid. He's just doing a little work for free. This ticket makes no sense. Okay. Don't email me. New users have to be submitted as a ticket. He might not have help desk access anymore. I don't know. I don't know. But I have to go now, Robin. I'm going to go. Proceed. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. Thank you. I love what you did. All right. Bye-bye. Thank you.",
