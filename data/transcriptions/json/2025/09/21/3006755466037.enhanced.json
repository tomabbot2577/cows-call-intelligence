    "text": " Thank you for calling MainSegret Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hey, how's it going? This is Omar. I'm calling in regards to a trouble ticket that was put in from Brian Denton. Alright, one second. Let me put some information down. Can you pull up that ticket? Yes, give me one moment. I'm sifting through my emails here trying to, because I just got copied in on it. It's looking like ticket, I'm going to click on this, 101302. all right yeah i see it's titled remove opt out bounce yes okay let me read through here let me skim through here unless you want to catch me up yeah i mean essentially uh brian's working with someone who on their database they have about 99 bounced emails and he's just trying to delete them off, but he doesn't want to do them one at a time. And we were just wondering if there was like a process of if it was possible from you guys, y'all being the admins, or if there was a method where we could just, you know, select all, delete. You'd like to remove emails off of the opt-out list in mass? yes yes it's looking like there was an Excel sheet I'm looking at I'm not in the database myself I was just kind of delegated this task and yeah there's about 98 emails from C Braun CB are a UN with the database it is database Four Season Talent Partners, LLC. Let me take a look at this. I think I understand what you said. um I'm sorry. I'm logging into the four season talent partners right now. I see Braun. I'm looking at the opt out list. I appreciate it. So, is, hold on, let me re-read the, what is, Garrett has been the person you've been working with. All bounces. So you want to remove all bounces from the opt-out list. Is that what I'm... Yes. Yes, please, if you could. If there's a way that we could do it on our end, that isn't just individually just clicking the individual email and hitting delete. That would also be very cool. interesting okay um Garrett was not able to perform like certain tasks like this so he asked another colleague of ours to take a look and they just haven't yet looking at the note like the private notes um she's very busy so that makes sense and i'm not sure why he didn't ask me i'd be the one to do this type of thing actually uh the thing is though i'm not sure if there's like a process for this because the email opt-in opt-out list is um i guess there for like a specific reason i'm not sure if we'd I mean, I guess it's your data, but yeah. Yeah, she was just – I guess the user of that database got a bunch of bounced emails, and she was just trying to delete them so that she wouldn't be able to email them ever again, I guess. That makes sense, right? I just got delegated this task. I apologize for not being fully informed on the matter. Hmm. Well, so, yeah, I don't think that what you just said doesn't really line up with what I was interpreting before. Okay, so if that's the case, you can please disregard what I'm saying because I clearly don't know what I'm talking about. I always just delegated this task to ensure that there was no issues with whatever Brian Denton was requesting to be facilitated, either by me, by you giving me instructions, or if it was going to be able to be done by you guys as a whole. Hold on. Maybe – Yeah, so it says – Maybe we both – Yeah. Yeah, so reading the initial ticket, it's like if someone got blocked by Microsoft when they sent out a sequence and those emails bounced back and were added to the opt-out list, how can I remove them easily instead of 500 at a time, as in removing the emails en masse versus just individually deleting the... so okay i think that okay okay okay okay i think i've had been like reading red herrings this whole time and now you're now you're explaining it in a different way and i'm thinking this this whole time the way he chose to word it kind of confused us on our end and so okay so when you say delete them you mean go to the name remove their email and save their name again without an email so that they can't be emailed again you don't yeah yeah oh okay i think the entire time garrett and robin uh thought you wanted to remove them from the opt-in slash opt-out list and there's like private messages where garrett's like how do you remove from the opt-in opt-out list and then there's like another tech giving like an example of like where those are stored and what potential query they could... So I think they're confused, and now you're explaining it differently. So that's helpful, at least. We can clarify that. Yeah, I mean, it just seems like the emails that she sent out bounced back because they were unwanted. So the task at hand here is like, okay, let's delete these email addresses so that I don't email them anymore and I don't get bounced back and I'm not bothering them and I'm not getting hit for spamming people that are opted out of receiving my emails. Okay. That's a much different task than what we were thinking you needed. So let me see. Can you roll people up off of this list? Yeah, I got this Excel sheet. I can forward this to you if there's an email address. I see that the Excel sheet is attached to the ticket. I'm not sure. I guess I should look at it. I'll look at it here. I'm not sure if there would be a way to incorporate an Excel sheet of this. Just to verify that the information of the Excel sheet lines up with what's on the database. It looks like it was exported from the database. Yeah. Okay, well then that would definitely line up then. Let's see if I can think of a way. Is there like a massive delete? Is there like a global change action to massively delete from a roll-up list or something? Like remove? I don't know. Let's see. Yeah, because I think the issue was that Brian and the user C. Braun didn't want to go through all those emails that got bounced and individually delete them because it is looking like it's upwards of... I think they were kind of picking at it over the days, and I think it was initially like 500 of them. I did see the number 500 at some point in that ticket when I was zooming through it. I don't see like a... Okay, well, this is a much less scary request because when people ask, like, can you remove the bounces off my email opt-out list, we're like, no, the person... Doesn't want the... Yeah, yeah. It's like a lethal kind of implication. No, no, we just want to remove them so that, like, they are no longer receiving emails from us. So let me update this ticket. Okay. and then I don't think this is something I do on the call but I think this is a doable task after I update the ticket and let everyone know like what the actual request of the ticket is and then I think we can get back to you okay wait well it's under Brian Denton's name if I message Brian Denton you won't see that huh yeah I mean I think it was mainly because he was waiting on a reply from you guys um oh and he just said that's why i got all on us yeah yeah so he's the one expecting the call here so oh okay so if i do respond to him he would be like this would be fine yes yes um i think were you gonna follow up with him like shortly after we were done on the phone or were you gonna follow up with him like in the morning or um yeah i got a half hour left in the day i can update the notes of this ticket and let everyone know we kind of misinterpreted the request. He just really wants to remove just the email address from those names, right? Yes. Because PCR won't send... The whole point of the opt-out list is PCR won't send emails to people who are bounced or whatever, but if you want to just get rid of it anyway to be sure, that's also totally reasonable as well to just keep your data super clean like i want to attempt to go there like it won't probably show up in your searches in the first place yeah so he was he was doing like the delete so what what happens when you press the delete on that window i don't know if you know what window i'm talking about i don't have the database open unfortunately but yeah there was like a whole roll-up of these email addresses and then there was like another column to the right that said bounced and uh the very first column to the right to the left was like edit and delete and all he was doing was clicking on delete delete delete delete what would hitting that delete what would hitting that delete button do okay that is the that is the opt-out list now we're back to the first request that i thought okay that was okay it's described as the opt-out list uh okay so maybe what would hitting what would hitting delete do because that's essentially what he wanted to do instead of like he wanted there to be like a mass like okay just click on all these select all and then one delete to delete all them what would deleting them do the if you remove that's just removing them from the opt-out list where now they can be emailed again potentially oh oh okay yeah the opt-out is the list of emails that have been opted out. So if you delete it from that list, that means they're no longer opted out. Okay. So what that, what that delete button would do is put them back in the opt in list. Yeah, essentially. Uh, yeah, sort of. Yeah. So if you, it sounds like what you wanted to do was go to the name record and like clear out their email field and then just save their name without an email. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's essentially what, what it ended up looking like when Brian was showing me if I have something misinterpreted here I don't I I think yeah because the reason I called was just to check up on the status of it just so I can give them a follow-up and And if there was any solution or any grievances of the request or for whatever reason it couldn't get done, if you want to contact him and, you know, have him specify, I think he's currently busy right now. Yeah, I'll update the notes on the ticket to let everyone know. and then either Garrett, because it's still assigned to him. Garrett will probably end up reaching back out with a next steps sort of message on the ticket itself, like to Brian under his name. And then I could be working with him to resolve the issue. It sounds like you want to just remove the emails from the name records. Is that correct? yeah i mean what he did was just click delete i don't know what that action does but he essentially wanted to not have to click delete in like 99 individual times i might have to talk to garrett because it sounds like garrett actually like put eyes on this and maybe maybe he'll be able to like double clarify just to be sure like okay i'll take in what you've said and what he'll say and then I'll probably know exactly what's happening and then I can maybe talk with Garrett and have a back and forth with him and try to figure out what happened there. Is he still on? I don't know if he works past five. It might be in the morning then. Actually, because Garrett might be off at five. I think he starts an hour early and leaves an hour early. Okay, okay, yeah. I think the best course of action there would be to just double verify with Brian what the intended task is. Sure, right now, yeah, I can do that. Right now it seems like double interpretation here. Don't know if we want to delete the emails completely or remove them from the opt-out list. I think one is feasible and one isn't, from what I'm hearing. I guess they're both technically feasible. One is just kind of like a weird legal, like, well, why are they bounced in the first place? You should leave them. Like, it makes sense to leave them on the opt-out list. And then, like, what you are requesting would be to remove them from the name record. So the name record could be like, you could have like a name and maybe if you have like their phone number or their address, all that stuff will still be there, but their email field will be blank. So if you happen to try and send out an email, they can't be sent an email because their email isn't there. Right. So that would be, that would make more of a, that makes more sense as like a request and it's a much more doable request as well. Well, they're both, I guess, the same. It's just I think they both involve, like, I would have to run, like, a SQL query on the database in the back end. And it's just a matter of, like, what table I'm removing the values from. So it's very equally doable tasks, but one makes more sense and is less, like, sketchy. Like, that kind of, I don't know, I guess it is your database. It is your data. But if like an email, we would advise like you, you keep it on the bounce list because it bounced for a reason. Unless, you know, for a fact that it bounced. Because I guess it could be the case that sometimes when you send a thing, it can like immediately bounce. And it's not actually the fault of the recipient, like clicking, like either the recipient not being there or like they opted out or whatever it is. sometimes it just immediately bounces and maybe that's why he needs to yeah i think i think that's what happened microsoft microsoft may have blocked them um oh so these are like false bounces that shouldn't be there okay that makes sense that makes a lot of sense okay that makes the first request like totally okay like if gary confirmed that with them i'm assuming he did because i don't think he'd be asking for this unabashed like he is if he didn't like know that i think i know garrett enough to like he probably covered that and like verified that this is an okay thing and then is asking that's why it's here so that uh that actually makes sense i think we got there okay i still need to talk to garrett but um it is a doable task but i think i think it's just this fell to the wayside because it's like kind of an out of the ordinary task and we're just kind really busy uh but since you called and you kind of bumped yourself to the top so um okay i'll uh i guess i'll just add notes and be like hey garrett uh do you need help with this because he i think he has another person and i think she just didn't get to it and i'm here now so i'll i'll ask him i'll i'll send brian a little update here and say what was your name omar omar Omar called on your behalf and say something like that and you know yeah they got perfect perfect yeah thank you so much it looks like I'll have to I wonder if there's a way to know exactly like why they bounced because if it was like a bounce like they don't exist I think it was because it was just I think it was just for mass emailing practice, which got them blocked by Microsoft. Right, okay. Some people... They're running a tighter and tighter ship as time goes on. Yeah. The Outlook emailing. Mm-hmm. Those... Yeah, yeah. I mean, if you could give Brian a little update and tell him that, Yeah, everything was spoken about. You said Garrett was going to contact him in the morning? I'm going to contact Garrett because he'll get back to me in the morning and I'll be able to get to the bottom of exactly what's happening. Okay, sweet. Thank you so much. I would be a better help. I just never saw this ticket before. I could help him get to the end of the goal. Okay, sweet. Thank you. Yeah, I'm glad I was able to get a hold of someone. So that's all that. I know. I know you called a couple times. I was focused on something else. And then my boss was like, hey, somebody keeps calling. So as soon as I jumped back in the phone queue, it rang and it was you. Okay, sweet, sweet. Hey, is that dedication, bro? I called you and nothing happened. so oh yeah i think it's um i think it's like the call forwarding because of my extension or something i don't know but either way i'm glad you answered and i'm glad we were able to get some forward progress here yeah just a bit tomorrow will be better but yeah um thanks omar i'll uh i'll do this here um off the call and just brian will have an update email shortly okay awesome thank you so much you have a nice rest of your day thank you you too all right All right, bye-bye.",
