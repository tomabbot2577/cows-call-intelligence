    "text": " Thank you for calling Name Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. It's Steve Terosian calling with Forest Recruiting Group. How are you, man? Good. How are you? I'm going to be okay. I've got a question for you. How can I determine how many resumes are attached to names records? so are you just you just want to find the number of records that have resumes or if they have multiple resumes on a name record uh are you familiar at all with the top echelon split network yes okay so i'm considering joining top echelon and and copying my pc recruiter website i mean a PC Recruiter database into theirs. They have a conversion fee of like 500 bucks and it only will copy records with resumes attached. I'm not sure if that's attachments or resumes, but I was trying to figure out how many I got and how many would go over and what's the real probability that they will place one of my candidates and pay for it all. Yes, so you can do that with a basic search for name records. Okay. In that drop-down options when you do the basic search there's a resume yes-no option and if you do for resume and then just put why in the fields that you're searching and then hit search that'll bring up all the records in your database that have a a resume attached to them. 154,556. Yep. Cool. That's a lot of opportunity every day for someone to find and pay me for my efforts, pay me for my asset, don't you think? Yeah, that's a pretty good chunk there. So does that include otherwise like attachments? For instance, I have a company questionnaire that is an attachment but not a resume that would have some keyword searches on it. Do you think that – is there a big difference between attachments and resumes? So the resume is always saved as an attachment, but the resume is specifically denoted on the back end of the database. So any time you see a record like that with that resume, yes, no, if you click on the resume tab, that's whatever is displaying in that resume tab is what the system considers the resume. Okay. What do you know about, what's your experience been with Top Echelon? I don't personally have any experience. I've just heard it mentioned a few times. kind of what they do, but I've never gotten any feedback on it from other clients. Because I'm thinking once they're out there, they're always out there, right? And if it's a year from now, somebody comes along and says, hey, tell me about this. I don't know. Seems like that's a decent idea, right? I don't know. Yeah, couldn't hurt. 500 bucks later, I think we're going to give it a shot. All right. Thanks for clarifying that for me. And I just knew there was an easy way. I just couldn't bend my brain around it. Not a problem. More than happy to help. All right. Fantastic. Thanks so much, buddy. We'll catch up to you soon. Appreciate you. Have a great day. Bye. I promise. Bye-bye.",
