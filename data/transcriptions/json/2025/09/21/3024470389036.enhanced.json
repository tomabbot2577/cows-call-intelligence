    "text": " Good afternoon. This is Lily. Hi, Lily. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm well. How are you, Jim? Pretty well. Pretty well. Got your voicemail. Wanted to give you a call, see what your question was. Thank you so much for giving me a call back. So, and also thank you for all your help thus far since yesterday. So I'm looking over the reset form that you sent over. And it's requiring a username to reset the password. Yeah. So we currently, prior to my request from yesterday, we have two licenses. We have two licenses in our account. One is for Robert Polk. I believe the other one is for Kathy Blackman. Those are the only two we've had. And neither of those are the admin account. Okay. Well, there should be, whether you use it or not, there's always an admin username included in the account. so it's always there free of charge just for this such an occasion so if you happen to come across a time where you need admin permissions and you don't have them and you need to change them there's always it's like a backdoor so you always have that admin access so you'll put the admin password then my guys can reset the password to the admin username which will then have full admin rights and then you can log in with that admin password and give you or any of the other users admin rights from there okay who would have received this email confirmation what the admin user Oh who do you want or who would have received it initially who would have received that initially well it probably came through to whoever signed the contract I would say oh boy okay originally set up It comes in the very initial email that they sent to create the link, yeah. Is there a way for us to get that username? Paul's not in the office, and I'm not sure. I would have to do something in his inbox when he comes in next time. Okay. Well, let's see. So you'd need the admin username, and you could log in from anywhere as long as you have the password. So we need it signed, but we need Paul's signature because he's the agreement signer. Mm-hmm. And you have no access to him? He's at an off-site meeting all day. If I could get this signed by him electronically, if that would suffice, I just need the username to complete the form. Oh, well, that username is going to be admin, A-D-M-I-N, admin. Oh, okay. That's the username. Yep. Perfect. Easy peasy. All right. And then I'll have it sent to email. Is it okay if I pull my email or does it need to be his? No, it can be yours. It certainly can be yours. Okay. Wonderful. Okay, then I'll complete this and send that right back to you. Okay. Perfect. Sounds good. Once I do, I'll put a ticket in. Once I do, I'll put a ticket in and then my tech team will reset the password and send it to you. Wonderful. Thank you so much. No problem. Bye now. Bye.",
