    "text": " Hello? Hi, is this Fred? Yes, it is. Hi, Fred. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence, PC Recruiter. Hi, Robin. How are you? How are you? I'm good. So do we have a bad email for you? Yeah, I thought I had the Fred at FredAnthony.com there for years. I don't know why the other one popped up. Okay. Fred at Fred. I'm fixing this here. Fred at FredAnthony. Okay, I'm going to make sure I fix this going forward because anything we try to send to you is going to be a problem if we can't. Okay, Fred at FredAnthony.com. All right, so we got that part fixed. So you're having a problem getting into the portal? um yeah i use my uh username and my password and oh okay so the billing portal you have to click sign up it's not related to your pcr username and password at all um one because it's an external site but two also not everybody that even does billing is even a pc recruiter user. So in one of those invoices, I think I re-sent them. Do you have one of them? Yeah, I do. Hold on. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So they'll have like a link for the portal. When you go into that link, or even from my email, you'll first have to click sign up. okay i'll do that okay and then what you can do is then go in pay the invoices you can also do auto pay or if you want i could set up auto pay for you and then you could just do the sign up later if you want so nice about signing up for the account is if you ever you know need to change your card if you have one of those billing portal accounts there's once you sign up and then go into the site, there's a vault area to manage your card on file. So that way, like, you know, if it's going to expire or something like that, you can just kind of update it on your own. Well, let's set up auto paint right now. And then I'm on my way out. So I'll go on and set up the password later today. Okay. All right. So what is the name on the card? It's Fred W E I G A N D T. Oh, so Anthony is not even your last name, is it? No, Anthony is my stage name and the company name. Oh, okay. All right, because we have two Freds in here. One with the last name Anthony and one with W-E-I-G-A-N-T. Okay. And that one had the other email address. Okay. So that was not used for billing. Okay. I'm sorry, so Fred W-E-I-G-A-N-D-T is the name on the card? That's the name on the card. Okay, first name, last name. And then the card number? Card number is, hold on a second. It's 3795 Okay. 860 0825 100 0202. Okay, let me read that back to you. 3795-860-082-51002. Correct. Okay. Expiration? Expiration is, let me make this thing hard to read. I told you. 326. Oh, 326. And the security number? It is 664. Okay. What is the address on the card? 1-1-5-4 South Wells Street. Okay. Apartment 8, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Okay. 5-3-1-4-7. Okay, I'm going to add the card. And it's that number, right? 3-7-9-5-8-6-0-0-8-2-5-1-0-0-2? Correct. I'm reading right from the card. Okay, perfect. It just kind of seemed like a little short. Is that American Express? Yeah. Okay, that's why. Their grouping is a little bit different. That's why. Okay. Okay, so let me then turn on auto pay for you. We'll do it on due date. Okay, so there are currently three invoices. Actually, one of them has a late fee applied. Let me take that off for you. Okay, and one of them, I checked my American Express bill. The one dated 5-13 was charged to my American Express. Let me see on here. That might have been the April invoice, though. I know. It just came through 5-13 on my American Express. Yeah. Let's see. Yep. That was, there was a payment on 5-16 and that was for the April invoice. Okay. So what I'm going to do is take the late charge off the May one. So that was during the time I kind of, through the transition, we kind of had both. So our bookkeeper probably just applied one for the April invoice. but now we're strictly only on the new system. All the card stuff had to be re-entered. We couldn't, like, transfer it over. Okay, so there's three. Each one is 7823. I'll go ahead and process all three of these now, and then the account is current, and then you'll be set up in auto. You're now set up in autopay in our new system. Okay, I'm just looking at my American Express bill here, And the bill that I have in front of me is for June, and it shows 5-16-25 for 78-23. So you're saying that's for the April? That was for the 4-21 invoice. That was during the time where we kind of had access to both systems before the switch. So our bookkeeper probably saw the open one, tried to process the card. But now going forward, it all has to be done in a new system. Meaning that we had to put your card details in, because we couldn't. Yes, I'm showing that there's three open. Hold on one second here. Oh, wait a minute. Why is the one system showing that? Well, that's odd. Okay. I'm going to only process I guess these two. Where's the action list? Let's see. Okay. Alright, we're all set. As long as this goes through, you should get a ring. Yeah, I've approved it. Payment view. Why is this one not showing? take some moment to sync here i'm so sorry about this okay i think we're good now all right it went through and everything's all paid and you should be getting receipts too for it as well yeah i'm seeing them coming on the email okay all right all righty i'm i'm not being charged double for the one month that's just because the payment goes back a couple months right correct yeah the one it was just processed later because you used to be on what was called like a sales receipt in like quickbooks which is really meaning that it sends you a seat and it tries then it tries to process it which doesn't always go through because the card is declined or whatever it just kind of sends you receipt but then when we switch to the new system we don't did not want to set up that way at all we want to do where it's an invoice with a true auto pay enabled so that's why we had to put in the card details and then when we did that switch we couldn't transfer the card information over like the full details that's needed to process it because a lot of it's masked for security so we just needed to set it up in the new system so you have that done now but again if you want you can always go into your once you do that portal sign up you would just click sign up you put in your email address put in your details and then usually it sends you like an email just to make sure it's you and then from there you can get into the portal and then in the invoices area you could see the invoices open or paid as long as they were generated from the new system. We didn't take like, you know, 20 some years of historical invoices that were already paid and transfer those over. But there's also a vault area. So if you ever need to like change your card, like, you know, it's about to expire, you can sign into that portal and go over to the vault area and change your card as needed. Okay. Okay. The only thing you still have to let us know is when your user count ever changes so that we would okay filling them out all righty well have a great week thank you so much thank you all righty",
