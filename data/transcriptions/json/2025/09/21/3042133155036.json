    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hello, this is Christian from Austin Major Group. I was asking about, like, we have two providers that have trouble logging to the timesheet through the mobile app. Oh, okay. So they are not the contractor. they are the employees okay so the the person who's is it the person who's trying to clock in and clock out is that who's having a trouble look okay let's Let's see. I would, some good troubleshooting steps for that. I would check to make sure. Is it telling them that they have an incorrect password or anything like that? Or is it just not? Let me ask real quick. OK. So I think it's just for the mobile app because they're able to sign in to the desktop fine and we suggested to like uh request to forget password as as well as uh redownloading that okay and so um when they re-download the app um they have to make sure that before they open the app so they'll download it to their phone but before they open the app They'll have to click an activation link in an email that you send them so that they can get connected back up to your particular database or your account and then open the app. So let me show you here. I just pull up my database. So to send those people an email that has one, the download link and the activation button that they click before opening it. OK. You would just go to you would go to the placement record. So let's see here. If you open up the position record that they are working at and then go to the placements tab and a list. everybody who's been placed on that position record with a date and their name. If you click on the date next to their name, it'll open a pop-up window with all the details about that. And there'll be a button that says app invite down at the bottom. It'll probably have a checkmark next to it, meaning that you sent that already. by clicking it again, we'll resend that invite, and it'll give them the button to activate before actually opening their newly downloaded app. So I would try that. Oh, go ahead. We only had a provider yesterday that just had trouble, and then another provider having trouble today. Okay. But the rest of ours haven't. So I guess it's about the resending invite. Yeah, that would be the first troubleshooting step I would try, just having them delete that app and then click that button to resend them the app invite and then have them download it, click the link in your email, and then finally open it and see if that works. Okay. And then if that doesn't work, just give me a call back. We can continue to try some troubleshooting steps. But usually that'll fix it. If it's not like a password issue is the other main reason that that doesn't work for people. Okay. So what's a good number to call back at in case? Yeah, you could just call this number, the 440-946-5214. And if you want to ask for me specifically, totally fine. My name's Garrett, and they'll pass you over to me. Gotcha. Thank you for the help. Yeah, no problem. Hopefully that does it for you, but we'll talk later if that doesn't fix it. Got it. Thank you. All right. Thanks so much. Bye.",
