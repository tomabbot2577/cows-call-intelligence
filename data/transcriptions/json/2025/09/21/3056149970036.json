    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? What would you like to name? Tyler. Hey, Tyler. My name is Gary Paul Veer, and I'm with Barrington Resource Group. Yeah. How are you? Good. How are you today? Good. Thanks. So I've been a longtime user of PC Recruiter probably over 20 years. But I'm moving in a new direction. with a different ATS system. And so I'm requesting a backup from a PCR. Is that something that you can help me out with? Yes. Let me... Give me two seconds here. I'm just looking up what I need to send you and get you here. So what I'm going to have to do is create a fresh desk ticket for the data return. But you said you were, are you, like, do you have an idea of when you'd be canceling your subscription with PC Recruiter? either towards the end of this month or the end of next month I don't know how long the data transfer takes place so hopefully within the next couple weeks but I just don't know and I'm not going to cancel until the data transfer is complete yeah data transfer doesn't take that long so what I'll have to do is I'm going to get you over to your account representative. Okay. Which looks like it is Brian Cain. Is it King or Cain? Cain. C-A-I-N-E. Okay. And so what he'll do is he'll put in the cancellation request with a data return. Okay. And so that way you'll get the data return plus the cancellation kind of all in one. If it was just the data return, I could put in that ticket. But since the cancellation, it has to come from him. Got it. Okay. So let me see if he is available. All right. So it looks like he is currently on another call. what I could do is transfer you over to his voicemail and that way he can give you a call back as soon as he is available. That's great. I really appreciate it, Tyler. Yep, not a problem. And he'll be able to go over the whole process with you as well. Okay, sounds good. Alrighty, transferring you in 3, 2, 1. Thank you.",
