    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Christy Kirksey. I'm calling with Data Masters. We've been a PC recruiter user for a couple of years. And I have a quick question for you. Yeah, what's going on? We're looking at SourceWale as an API integration partner. and they're asking me to go into our system and add a user. And I wanted to find out if that was going to affect our pricing or billing. Not for the API users, no. So when you go to create that user, they should have given you the instructions. You designate that it's an API username so you don't get charged for that one. Okay. Well, I just wanted to make sure that that wasn't going to mess with billing and invoicing and all that. No, you'll be good to go. Okay. Wonderful. Thanks so much, Tyler. Yep. Not a problem. You have a great day. All right. Thank you. You too, sir. Bye-bye. Thank you.",
