    "text": " Good morning, this is Josh. Good morning, Josh. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, Jim. How are you? Very well. Very well. I wanted to give you a call as we kind of exchanged some emails and just see how I could help. Yeah, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but I started as an MRI recruiter in 2008. We had a DOS-based ATS. It was freaking terrible, Jim. And we all fought like crazy to get a PC recruiter for our office. Right when we got it, I left that company. So I signed up with PCR. Through Jim, I got the MRI $65 a seat discount. PCR has been okay for us for a long time. The AI piece is what really kind of has tipped us over. I know there's a bunch of features PCR has, but we're, I don't know. We don't feel very connected. We don't feel there's a lot of training. The price just went up on me out of nowhere. And Clockwork has been banging on our door saying, hey, check out all this stuff. So I hate to be leaving. PCR has been very good to us, but we're going to try Clockwork for now. And I just thought I would tell you all that. I filled out the data transfer sheet this morning and I paid $175. So I think that's taken care of. And then rather than worry about any early termination fees, I'd like us to be able to fall back on PCR in an emergency if we need it while we're making the transition. So if my agreement goes until April of 26, is that what you said? Yep. I think my plan would just be to keep at least one subscription to it. Well, if I cancel one, I get an early – do you know what the early – yeah. How much is the early termination fee? It was at 80% of what your remaining payment to do would have been. So that's that early termination fee. but you could drop down to one user and just kind of make it the emergency time yeah and in truthfully a lot of people really do that no matter where they're leaving for PC recruiter for if they do leave they'll a lot of times keep one user on to fill out their contract or even indefinitely I've had some people to keep one on just in case they needed some access or anything like that so that's not uncommon to keep one user active that might be something I consider I don't think I need that today but yeah so I feel guilty like I said teacher thanks company to work with we're just relieving for a little more I hope and do you need anything else from me at the moment I don't um so so yeah so the AI suite is that something you weren't pleased with it so much when you were looking at or weren't trained on it or what i think what really happened to us with pcr is we lost direct contact with you guys like there was just nobody following up with us nobody explaining stuff nobody who was like our rep so to speak who was like hey are you guys trying this hey can i tell you that that kind of thing and um like i said when i first started on pcr i thought it was had a lot of features. We never ended up learning most of them. And then the thing Clockwork has really sold me on is the contact information gathering, the bulk emailing, some of the AI tools, that kind of stuff. So I'm guessing that PCR has an answer to all of those things based on our research. we do but yeah it just it felt like it's not a time to try something else but I don't certainly don't want to burn a bridge you never know we could be yeah I'm sorry that that kind of went by way and I don't know if you know Jim Wise is no longer here he has moved on he's kind of almost semi-retired right now and so that might have been why nobody had been in touch because he's been gone for some months now So what I'll do, I will go ahead and just kind of check the ticket here, make sure that they've got that in to get that data returned. I'll make that available in a downloadable format. It'll come through and they'll email you the link, the password and everything to download it. Then whenever you're ready to drop down to one user, just send me an email that says I want to drop to one user. I can put in a ticket and have the pricing adjusted that day. so once you're fully moved over let me know and I can adjust that so we can we can get that done and then then we're there unless you need us you'll have that one user but if you do want to revisit us if things go horribly awry give me a call and we can review or revisit or maybe even formally cancel the whole thing if needed down the line we can do that too thank you Jim you're my main contact over there now I appreciate your help okay perfect all All right, anything you need to let me know. All right, you too. Take care. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I really appreciate you. No worries. No worries. Yeah, anything you need to let me know. Bye-bye. Okay, bye now.",
