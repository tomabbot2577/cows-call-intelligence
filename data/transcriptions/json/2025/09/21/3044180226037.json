    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Jeremy Altman. I spoke to you earlier about getting capture on my – and I'm trying to do it on Edge, and when I click on the capture, download, and set up instructions, it immediately goes to Chrome. So I went to Edge. Even if I close Chrome, it opens it up and goes to Edge. So I closed it. I pasted it in Edge, and now it's giving me something. I just want to make sure it's the right thing. Is it capture1.com? Is it bringing you to, like, a page to, like, download the extension? I'm not sure. I mean, it says scan QR, you know, for Bing. Can we just do it? Is it possible on Edge? I just don't want to screw it up and bring something in that I shouldn't have. Yeah, so if you, what you can do, that link, that download link. Now, the launcher, if it's on the computer, it's on the computer. It doesn't matter if it's in Edge or Chrome, correct? Correct. Okay. So, talk to me again then about the capture download. Yeah, let me double check here real quick. Give me one second. Because, again, I'm clicking on that, and it's literally opening up Chrome. Yeah, that's probably because you have Chrome set as your default browser. Yes. Yep, I do. So what you can do... Oh, what I'll do, actually, is I'll take that URL. Yep. Yeah, the copy... Put it into the... Right? Copy it into the Edge. Yep. Yeah, you could do the copy link address. So, like, right-click on the download Chrome here link. Okay. Yep. All right. So I'm here now. Capture setup. Now, I have downloaded the PCR extension here. Is that going to open up the default again, or is it going to do it here? No. So right-click on that link, and it will give you an option to copy the link address. Okay. and then when and then paste that link into a new tab and it'll take you to the page you need to go to into a new tab on edge yep okay all right okay all right so it's done that and it's saying download PCR capture here. That's a clickable, but then it says add to Chrome button. So is there one for Edge? So it's just a Chrome extension, but you right clicked on the download here link? Oh, right click on the download here link. Download TCR Right click on that Copy that link Yes And then open it up and put it into it Okay Now I get it Now I get it Okay And then get Yep Allow extension from other stores Just allow Yep Add PCR, add extension. Okay. That was what I needed to do. Okay, and then just launch it? Yeah, you'll need to pin the extension and log into the extension in Chrome, or in Edge, rather. All right, so it just uploaded something. Do I go in there or it just downloaded something? Yeah. So you'll go to that puzzle piece again in Edge. In Edge. Okay. Okay. PCR capture and pin it. That's right. Okay. Yep. And then what? You'll need your database URL. Okay. That's right. Okay. All right. And then click on the. Yep. Click on the... PPR capture? Yep.
