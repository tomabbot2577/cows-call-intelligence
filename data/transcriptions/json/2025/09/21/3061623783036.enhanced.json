    "text": " Thank you for calling me, Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yeah, Garrett, this is Greg Schmidt from Prosperity and Rogers Group. Are you guys having some technical difficulties? Nothing that's been reported. What issues are you seeing? Well, I just said the network is not available or whatever the IP address. And I know I've been working with Brian Cain because we're a little behind on some things money-wise, but nonetheless, I just thought I'd ask, as it says, call technical support. Okay. Let me pull up your account here. I was a little worried that I just Googled you guys, and it was talking about some lawsuits that are filed and stuff like that. So it made me scared a little bit that something bigger was going on. Gotcha. No, yeah. It looks – oh, it might be – it says your account is currently on hold with billing. So that might be the issue. Here, let me transfer you over to billing. I think they – yep, it says that they just made that change today on the account. It says on hold. so yeah I could transfer you over to there to see if you want to clear that up with them but that's probably what's going on I've been dealing with golly I was talking with Bill Kubitschek about it and I talked with what's her name oh Robin is head of billing now is it Robin yeah that sounds right yes exactly but she had handed me over to Ryan because he's been my rep for many years but so oh gotcha okay um i could see if do you want me to transfer you to robin or maybe i could see brian uh it's available let me try it with brian because he's the one i last talked to in the last few days so me and him were working on okay i'd like to pay they have it set up on our on the invoicing where you could only have to pay by credit card and i'd like to pay by by having it taken out of our account rather than through a credit card so i was working on getting him the what do you call it? You know, routing numbers and all that kind of stuff. And so maybe I should stick with Brian for the moment, although I just tried to call him about 10 minutes ago and I didn't. I mean, I just left him a voicemail. So if he's available, that'd be great. Okay. Yeah, I'll at least try it. Let me see, transfer you over, see if he picks up one second. okay yeah i got no answer from brian he might be away from his desk but um so yeah you said you left a message i could maybe uh i'll send a chat to him in our support system chat to say check your messages greg's uh trying to get a hold of you um if that helps at all yeah that'd be good that'd be good because he's been my i've had a customer for like 20 some years so So he's been my rep all along. So, all right. Well, thank you. I appreciate it for now. And then I'll call back if I need more. I just, well, what's going on with these lawsuits? Because they look a little scary to me. I mean, is that true? So, yeah, as far as we've been told, there's just been some changes in management currently. Um, so we do have, uh, a few people, um, that, that are no longer working with the company that were originally in the management and owner positions. And, um, some other people came in, um, as our new, you know, management team. So those are the changes that we've, again, the support team at least have experienced and, and talked about with the, uh, kind of the new management team related to the lawsuits. I see. All right. Well, it's, it's all, you know, these things happen in the business world. So I just was, you know, worried because pretty much my life's work on is with you guys. So as far as, you know, the databases, you can't do much without your database on our, our, our business. And, uh, all right, well, let's just stick with Brian for now. And, and, uh, I just want to get some things done. Okay, thanks. That sounds great. Yep, I'll leave it known for Brian and expect a call from him soon. Awesome. You got it. Thanks. Bye.",
