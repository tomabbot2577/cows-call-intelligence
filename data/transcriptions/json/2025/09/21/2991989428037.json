Not bad. Garrett, how are you? I am Melissa. I think you're on as well. Good. Hello. Hello. Okay, so glad we can all get on today. So wanted to kind of get us started here to take a look at the training here. So Melissa, I am introducing to you Garrett, who's going to be your trainer for PC Recruiter. He is going to be the one getting you trained up on PC Recruiter here. and generally what will happen are you part of the July 7th dimensional search training class yes okay okay so what we'll try to do is get a couple couple maybe three sessions in before that class happens how much you can get there probably at least two I think and here it's going to be going to get you up and running and training on how to use the system all of that and we actually work with dimensional search so you'll have a couple hours with Garrett couple hours with dimensional search then they'll kind of toggle back and forth to get you not only trained up on PC recruiter but dimensional search will also go through some of their use cases recruiting training and stuff like that if you need any time to add a user drop a user or anything like that that comes to me so come right to me for that or if there's anything you don't know who to talk to let me know and I can get you to someone who can help so today Garrett has a few questions for you. I know since you're a dimensional search, we know that you need RingCentral. We know that you need HireEasy. So we know some of the basics there. Garrett's got a few questions to kind of run through with you today. And then at the conclusion of today's call, he'll get you scheduled for your first couple of training sessions. So I'll turn it over to you to go through the questions you have. Awesome. Thanks so much, Jim. Nice to meet you, Melissa. Yeah, like Jim said, a few questions here. First off, what industry will you be recruiting in? The insurance industry. Perfect. And will this be permanent placement, temporary placement, staffing? Permanent. Permanent, okay. And have you been in recruiting before? Would you consider yourself kind of a beginner, intermediate, advanced? Definitely beginner. Perfect. All right. And then will there be any other admin users on your PCR database other than yourself? No. Okay. Got it. Let's see. What is your operating system? Are you on Windows or Mac? Windows. Excellent. Do you prefer Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for browser? Chrome. Okay. And who is your email provider? Is it like an Office 365 or a Gmail? Office 365. Excellent. And then let's see. We do know that you're going to be integrating with Zoom Info, HireEasy, RingCentral is another one Dimensional Search always uses. Are there any other third-party tools that you plan to integrate with PCR? are? No. Okay. Awesome. I think that does it for me. Everything else I can just kind of fill out here based on the patterns with dimensional search. Awesome. So let's get a couple trainings on the schedule. We're going to be doing hour trainings and hour blocks, and we can schedule too now. And then, you know, not a problem if at any point you need to reschedule, just shoot me an email. Very fluid there. So for this week, I have one opening left and then we can start looking at next week. Do you happen to be available on Thursday the 26th at 10 a.m.? and that's eastern time sorry oh eastern time so that'd be nine o'clock my time um yes i can do that awesome okay let's let's check my other okay i'm still working a full-time job so let me make sure gotcha okay yeah no that's good nine o'clock good okay perfect so So it'll be Thursday the 26th, 9 o'clock your time, 10, 9, 10. Okay. And then looking at the following week, Monday the 30th, I have morning and afternoon slots available. And then on the Wednesday the 2nd, I have an 1130 Eastern. So would either of those days work for you? Let's do Monday. Okay. Would you prefer morning or afternoon? Morning. Okay. So I have the 10 a.m. Eastern or 11.30 Eastern. Let's do the, let's just stay with the 10. Perfect. All right. And I think that's good for now. We will, yeah, you're on the 70s, Ed. Okay. Yeah, we can get the first two trainings in. I think that's good. and then they prefer to have you jump over to dimensional search for some training, then you'll come back to me for training three. So I'll send you an invite email for each of those trainings. And if anybody else, if you have team members or something you want to join, you can forward that to them. Otherwise, let us know if you have questions in the meantime. And like Jim said, you can reach out to him for account changes, reach out to me or questions about how does the software work for sure we look forward to getting you up and running awesome sounds good all right all right thanks so much thank you bye have a great afternoon bye bye",
