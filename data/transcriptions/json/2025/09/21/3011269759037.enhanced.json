    "text": " This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi there. I have had this problem a couple times with PCR now since you guys did the last update. When I go to respond to somebody or to reply in the email section, it just brings up a transparent box. I can't see the box to actually type into it. Gotcha. Okay, yeah. So that sometimes happens. some computers need to clear cache when we push an update. So let me walk you through those steps. Do you have PCR pulled up currently? Yes. Okay. So then go to the three dots at the top right of your browser. And then find... Okay. Oh, sorry. Yeah, far top right, three dots. And then find the one called More Tools towards the bottom. Yep. then developer tools. Okay so that'll open up some coding some things just ignore all that just leave it off to the side and then right click on your browser's refresh button so that's to the left of the web address up at the top you have a little refresh just right click on that it'll give you the option to empty cache and hard reload. Okay, yes. That should slowly kind of refresh and reload your page. It takes a minute sometimes. Once that reloads, you can close out of the developer tools, and hopefully that's all it needed. Okay, let me just double-check that. Let me go back into my email here, inbox. Okay, let me see. Okay. There, yep, that worked. Excellent. So that's great. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Awesome. Thank you. Thanks. Bye.",
