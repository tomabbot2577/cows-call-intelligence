    "text": "Hi, this is Kevin. Can I help you? Hello, Kevin. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, Jim. I'm good. What's going on? I just wanted to give you a call and find out kind of just what you needed. I'm going to have one of my techs give you a call, one of my support people here. So the mail folders, you're looking to set up integrated IMAP email within PC Recruiter? Yeah, I've already done all the boxes and all that stuff. I just need somebody to stack out the folders for me. I can't do – there's one step that you do. So you log in as the user, open email configuration gear, preferences, left side, lower section. Here's where the incoming mail goes. I can't figure out where to set up the first mailbox and then have it automatically terrace underneath it. Okay, okay. So we want to get all of the folders set up from their Gmail or whatever in PC Recruiter? Yeah. If you look at Ryan, who's the person I'm trying to set up, he's already got his bulk mail, his regular mail. I just need to get the folders set up so in-mail can come, trash can go, sent can go, that kind of stuff. Okay. Sounds like that's IMAP folder integration there. And then API key, I will put that in the ticket. and then the mail folders, what I'll do is I'll see if they have something they can reference. I'm in sales, so I just kind of gather information to get support to give you a call. And Josh is no longer with the company. Did you guys have a massive turnover? What has happened here? I've been with you guys forever, and I've never not been able to get a hold of somebody. We've had some changes, and we did have several technical and support people leave, and we're bringing on a new one very soon. So we've had some turnover. Josh left. We've had some new management come in. So we've changed it up a bit. So we have had a little bit of turnover. Gotcha. We're kind of getting things back corrected. So is Tyler still with you or is he gone? He's gone too. That's too bad. He was a good guy. He was great. Robin is still there, I guess. Yeah, Robin is still here. I think she had reached out. But I'm going to put in a ticket to the team and have the first person who's available reach out to get something. Okay. So here's the drawback. I am tied up in meetings from 10 to 1230, so it'll have to be after 1230 today. I am central time. Current time for me is 10 o'clock. Perfect. After 1230 central, I will put that in there. And I have you listed as 10 users. Is that correct? I'm showing 10 logging in. No, I've got less. Yeah, you've got less. Yeah. And the one that you're setting up is temporary. We'll see if he makes it. Okay. Okay. How many do you have that are logging in? I'm showing 10. Let me see. So I have myself, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. And then you have my offshore person, Archana, who is 10. So that's correct. 10 users. Okay. I only have you at 7. So let me get you down to 10. And then if you need to drop and otherwise. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yeah, you got 10. Perfect. Let me get you down to 10. And by the way, these ebb and flow. Well, I had four that I dropped to two, and that's just how recruiting works. Absolutely. Yeah, anytime you need to add or drop, pop me an email and get a ticket in that day. So I'm Jim at mainsequence.net is my email address, and I can help you get anything. So you are sales, is that correct? Yep, I'm the lead sales right now. I always have been. I've been here 26 years, so I've been here quite a while. Oh, geez. Okay, so Jim, who's the owner? What's his name? I forget. Bill. Bill Kubitschek is one of the owners. Yeah, Bill lives in Hawaii. Bill and I spent a bunch of time in September at the PCR or at the SRA conference so you know Tino as well then yes I do Tino did a lot of the work on my system yeah so you've known Tino longer than I have but he's been doing a lot of stuff for me he's usually my first reach out but he's been busy with other stuff right now so I'm trying to get this wrapped up let me get this ticket in and have someone give you a holler and get the squared away for you. All right, Jim. Thank you. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.",

good.\n\n8\n00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:12,768\nWhat's going on?\n\n9\n00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,791\nI just wanted to give you a call and find out kind of just what you needed.\n\n10\n00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,100\nI'm going to have one of my techs give you a call, one of my support people here.\n\n11\n00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,302\nSo the mail folders,\n\n12\n00:00:21,322 --> 00:00:23,148\nyou're looking to set up integrated IMAP email within PC Recruiter?\n\n13\n00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,560\nYeah, I've already done all the boxes and all that stuff.\n\n14\n00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,139\nI just need somebody to stack out the folders for me.\n\n15\n00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:34,575\nI can't do – there's one step that you do.\n\n16\n00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,004\nSo you log in as the user,\n\n17\n00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,589\nopen email configuration gear,\n\n18\n00:00:38,849 --> 00:00:39,331\npreferences,\n\n19\n00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:40,213\nleft side,\n\n20\n00:00:40,294 -->

then have it automatically\n\n23\n00:00:47,893 --> 00:00:48,836\nterrace underneath it.\n\n24\n00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,448\nOkay, okay.\n\n25\n00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,535\nSo we want to get all of the folders set up from their Gmail or whatever in PC\n\n26\n00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:54,997\nRecruiter?\n\n27\n00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:55,888\nYeah.\n\n28\n00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,822\nIf you look at Ryan,\n\n29\n00:00:57,842 --> 00:00:59,224\nwho's the person I'm trying to set up,\n\n30\n00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:00,306\nhe's already got his bulk mail,\n\n31\n00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:01,068\nhis regular mail.\n\n32\n00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,407\nI just need to get the folders set up so in-mail can come,\n\n33\n00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:10,808\ntrash can go,\n\n34\n00:01:10,828 --> 00:01:11,610\nsent can go,\n\n35\n00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,373\nthat kind of stuff.\n\n36\n00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:15,427\nOkay.\n\n37\n00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:18,718\nSounds like that's IMAP folder integration there.\n\n38\n00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,074\nAnd then API key, I will put that in the ticket.\n\n39\n00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:24,667\nand then the mail folders,\n\n40\n00:01:24,687 --> 00:01:27,058\nwhat I'll do is I'll see if they have something they can reference.\n\n41\n00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:28,643\nI'm in sales,\n\n42\n00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,780\nso I just kind of gather information to get support to give you a call.\n\n43\n00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,493\nAnd Josh is no longer with the company.\n\n44\n00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,734\nDid you guys have a massive turnover?\n\n45\n00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,396\nWhat has happened here?\n\n46\n00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,866\nI've been with you guys forever,\n\n47\n00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:43,018\nand I've never not been able to get a hold of somebody.\n\n48\n00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:44,542\nWe've had some changes,\n\n49\n00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:47,048\nand we did have several technical and support people leave,\n\n50\n00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,712\nand we're bringing on a new one very soon.\n\n51\n00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:53,118\nSo we've had some turnover.\n\n52\n00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:53,978\nJosh left.\n\n53\n00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,820\nWe've had some new management come in.\n\n54\n00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,154\nSo we've changed it up a bit.\n\n55\n00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,059\nSo we have had a little bit of turnover.\n\n56\n00:01:59,660 --> 00:01:59,853\nGotcha.\n\n57\n00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,620\nWe're kind of getting things back corrected.\n\n58\n00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:03,875\nSo is Tyler still with you or is he gone?\n\n59\n00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:05,457\nHe's gone too.\n\n60\n00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:06,557\nThat's too bad.\n\n61\n00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:07,559\nHe was a good guy.\n\n62\n00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,379\nHe was great.\n\n63\n00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,632\nRobin is still there, I guess.\n\n64\n00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,800\nYeah, Robin is still here.\n\n65\n00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,020\nI think she had reached out.\n\n66\n00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,443\nBut I'm going to put in a ticket to the team and have the first person who's\n\n67\n00:02:18,443 --> 00:02:19,800\navailable reach out to get something.\n\n68\n00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,380\nOkay.\n\n69\n00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,460\nSo here's the drawback.\n\n70\n00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,780\nI am tied up in meetings from 10 to 1230, so it'll have to be after 1230 today.\n\n71\n00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,880\nI am central time.\n\n72\n00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,040\nCurrent time for me is 10 o'clock.\n\n73\n00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:30,940\nPerfect.\n\n74\n00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,400\nAfter 1230 central, I will put that in there.\n\n75\n00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,780\nAnd I have you listed as 10 users",
