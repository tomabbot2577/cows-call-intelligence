Wanted to give you a quick call just to follow up on an email I just sent over. I looped Robin in to check and see about the invoice you pay annually, so I didn't think you had a balance, but she's going to check on that. And as I looked at your record, it looks like she emailed or had a call with you maybe at some point this afternoon as well. So she's checking with the rest of the team. She's going to let you know what she finds out. If there's anything else you need with regard to PC Recruiter or if you have any questions or anything on that, please feel free to give me a call, 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks.",
