What I can do is transfer you to his voicemail, and he can give you a call back as soon as he's available. Okay, is Robin available by chance? She is not either. She is in another training. Okay. Yeah, I was supposed to be on a call with Garrett at 10 a.m. this morning, and I thought he meant Mountain Standard time. I just looked at my calendar, and he scheduled it for like 7 a.m. my time. So I wanted to see about either rescheduling this or what, but yeah, that's why I'm calling in. Yeah, let me transfer you to Garrett's voicemail, and then he'll give you a call back as soon as he's back. Okay, thank you, sir. Yep, not a problem. Transferring you on 3, 2, 1.",
