    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi. I did install an extension for PCRecruiter. However, I can't link my account to the extension. Oh, when you're signing in up at the top right of the screen? Yeah. Is that where you're having trouble? Okay. So is it asking you for your PCR web address? Your URL? Your web address. It should be the link that I'm using to access the PCRecruiter, right? Right, yes. Whatever your login link is, whatever you have, bookmarks to access PCR, just paste it in there. Yeah. And after that, it went through asking for a username, password, and a database. And then when I input my information, it still won't go through. We tried resetting the password, but still not working. Oh, okay. So the, are you choosing the correct database? Maybe it might be a database. Do you have multiple ones to choose from in that dropdown? It's only one database is available. Red Claw Consulting, is that the correct one? Yeah. Okay, let me check to see. So yeah, we don't have any access to your passwords, but I can double check that the username is correct. Which username were you using? It's Judy B, J-U-D-I B. Okay, got it. Yep, I can confirm that is the correct username. It's got a no spaces in there, and it's all caps. The password is case sensitive. I don't know if that would change anything, but it seems like the password would be the issue if you have the right database and the right username. Yeah, regarding that one, we tried resetting that password, but it still won't go through. And I'm sure I did input the correct password as well. Okay, I can jump on a screen share and kind of walk you through the steps of resetting a password again. Do you have the admin access to change passwords or do you need another team member to help with that? No, it's a different team member who reset the password. Oh, okay. Let's see. I can double check that you have the right web address as well that you're entering at first. that. So yeah, let's jump on a quick screen share. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings. Yeah, meetings.ringcentral.com. And if it asks for a meeting ID, I have that whenever you're ready. Yeah, it's asking for a meeting ID. Okay. Okay that is 676-534-498. 676-534-498. Correct. four four nine eight correct All right, and then if it asks about joining with audio, you can just mute that at the bottom left since we're already on the phone. And then go to the blue share button at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Awesome. All right. So go ahead and click on that top right button, the capture icon. Perfect. And let's double check that. Right, close and something. That looks good. Go ahead and enter your username and password. I'll just see what the error comes up as. Okay. Let's try this. Go ahead and log out of PCR, the actual screen you have in the background there. Oh, yeah, you can close that. It would just be the little gear icon. And then log out. And click Log In again. And go ahead and type in that password instead of using the one that's already there. Just retype in the password you're using now. Oh, okay, I see what's happening. It says you've exceeded your number of login attempts, so that just means it's locked. Let me unlock that for you. I think that might be what the issue was. Go to unlock account, save. Save. All right, go ahead and try to enter that again and see if that works. Awesome. Go ahead and check always allow on that pop-up in white, the little checkbox, and open. Good. And yeah, let's try that now on the capture tool. Maybe that's all it needed was an unlock. Is the username case sensitive? No, it's Yeah, that doesn't really matter. It's just the password that's case sensitive. Awesome. Okay, yeah, I think it was just locked from too many password attempts, but you should be in good shape now. Do you want to jump over to maybe LinkedIn and test to make sure it's popping up for you? And, yeah, just – oh, there we go. There's a quick add. Awesome. Yeah, it seems to be working. Excellent. Okay. Okay. Thank you. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Okay. Okay, I will. Thank you very much. Thanks. Bye.",
