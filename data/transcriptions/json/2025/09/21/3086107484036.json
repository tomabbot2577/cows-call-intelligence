We just, our tech team member had to jump into another meeting, so things got a little bit messed up today with scheduling. Sorry about that. Is there another time that we can maybe reschedule? I know the tech team member I talked to was saying four o'clock today is still available for him. We could just push it a little bit later. Four p.m. Eastern. So that's well, that's in a half hour from now. Yeah. Would that work for you? Yeah, that works. Oh, great. OK, then let me grab that on his calendar right now. So it doesn't get booked up. And four p.m. That's Tyler. Got it. OK. Cool. I will send you a new invite. Sorry again. Yeah, just we had a big company wide meeting in the middle of the day and I've been racing to get my schedule back on track. So sorry about that. I will. Yeah, I'll send you an invite and Tyler and I will be able to continue to troubleshoot with you. OK, so we got it for about a half hour. Yep. From now. Sounds good. Perfect. All right. Thanks. Thanks.",
