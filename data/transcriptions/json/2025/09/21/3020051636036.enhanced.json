    "text": " Hello? Hello? hello can you hear me I can hear you can you hear me yes hi this is Stacy calling from Connecticut oh hi Stacy how are you I couldn't hear you at first I wasn't sure if you could hear me and yeah I was just like oh well um I'll wait till I hear something you know what I mean like the music and then it was just like silence and I was like I don't know if anybody actually answered the phone or not so yeah it sounded like I heard some background stuff but couldn't hear your voice at least. What's going on? Okay. So I've been trying to get a hold of Mackenzie or Nick. Sent them several emails, sent them left messages. Like, you know, we're using, we're trying to use the new PCRM. I have questions about that. We've done some integration with Zoom, and I need to talk to somebody about how can I map, like, PCR Zoom when I'm trying to update a candidate. And it's not, I've mapped it where, you know, if I'm importing from Zoom, like, I've mapped it that way. But when I go to click on a candidate or whatever, the field, that's where I need to map it. And they said it's within PCR. So, So I don't know who the best person I need to speak to about this. Now, where are you starting from? Let me ask you this. In the Zoom thing? Yeah. Like, are you starting from Zoom site and then mapping over to, like, exporting to a piece of Twitter? No, I've already mapped that angle. It's when I'm in a candidate's record, okay? Okay. And then I can click on, you know, the little Zoom thing, and then, you know, the field. Is that the update with Zoom info option? Right. Right. Okay. Okay, so that, I don't think we do probably as much as if you were to start from Zoom. I think they make a lot of custom fields. Really, I believe what you're doing. Well, what I've done is in PCR, so I didn't want it to override the data that we already have. okay just to make sure you know what I mean um and so when you click on the zoom like update okay so I have created custom fields in every button you know in the candidate thing it says zoom cell zoom personal email business phone and zoom you know uh business phone business email so if I click on zoom and then um I go to update a candidate okay um and then it says you know here's the field. It's the field email address. So it has like email address, homework, hotmail, AOL, pager, broadcast. It's not giving me the field options that I created for this. Let's see. I might have to do a screen share with you because I don't have a Zoom account. Let me see. Okay. I can't even see what it does. I don't go into it really too much myself because I don't have a Zoom account. And I know it's kind of like, I don't remember if that one's customizable. So you have to have a thing. Update with Zoom. I can't even log in. Can we do a screen share? Because I don't know if that was one. Because they're two separate things. They're not the same program. Like if you start with Zoom, it's basically what they wrote. But if you're coming from us, it's based on what we wrote. Ours, I don't think is customizable. so you may not have as many like you may not have the same options as if you were starting from Zoom okay yeah I'm just trying to figure out like it might just be like some basic yeah it might be some basic fields but I don't really remember to be honest let me see if my documentation at least gives me some screenshots maybe so that I don't sound completely stupid and we can screen share if you want i mean i can show you what i'm looking at see this okay enhance the zoom info that's whenever it's in panel will appear okay enter credentials you're going to choose a company because i feel like it's basically almost the same thing as capture if i remember right on the screen i don't remember if there's any kind of configuration change image yeah I don't think there's I think it's just a certain list um because you're really just supposed to be kind of updating like pulling so might be better to start from zoom info to have more flexibility let's do a screenshot I forget do you have ring central yeah okay so I'll do it I'll set up the meeting that way okay okay video start okay so if you can go to video and select join in your ring central app i'll give you a meeting id just uh when you do join we don't obviously don't need your camera but don't choose to join with audio either since we're on the phone. Otherwise, we sometimes get a lot of background noise. Look at Echo. Okay. So, hold on. I have my RingCentral desktop, so I might have to bring up the other one. Yeah, because I don't see any details listed here about customizing it. Let's see. Okay. Change image, first name, last name, title, address, email, phone, social. I think that's really all it's supposed to do. If you choose an email field, if you leave it as undefined. Okay, for email field, you have to choose an email field. For a phone number, you have to choose a phone field. I'm trying to even get the right sample right now. Yeah for what I see with customers when they do use the option for exporting from ZoomFO to PCR they actually it's a bunch of custom fields that they end up creating from that because they transfer more than what our fields are. Some of the fields just don't. Like, there's got to be. Yeah, ours is basically a version of Capture. And if I remember right, this is not one that you customize. Like, you can't go in and configure which fields you would want it to pull or even populate. It's just, like, if you're on a record, and then you'll need, I think you can only use the feature if there's an email address. And then it finds the record in Zoom and so that has that email, but it only uses certain fields. So you don't have all of the options that you would have if you're starting from Zoom itself. All right, what's the meeting ID? 050-394-810. All right, it was messing up. 050-394-810. 394. 394. And then the last row, 810. 810. 810. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. 31. So what I'm going to have you do is click share at the bottom and then go over to entire screen. Sometimes when you just pick one, it only shows literally that one. So if something's popping up, I don't always see everything. Okay. So you see my screen now? Yeah. So I just pick this guy here, right? And see where it says these email addresses? homework, hotmail, AOL, pager, blah, blah. Like, you know, some of these, like, this is what I want to map here for one. And then same with the phone. You know, like, if he had a phone or whatever in there. Okay. So what are your fields? Those two. So right now, like, if I'm in Zoom. Oh, okay. Let's try this. Zoom cell phone. That doesn't look like it's set up as a phone field. You might have to just change the field type. Let's try this. Oh, I hit an uncle named Jeff Spacer. Not the same person. I probably. Well, I can get all of this. I have mapped if I go into my Zoom. Right. But right now, just looking at the field, I think it's just like a single line regular field. It doesn't know it's a cell phone. Let's try this. Let's go up to system. Because I do see some other custom field names that I think we just have to tell the custom fields like what type of field it is. Go down to database setup. No, no, no, no. I'm so sorry. Right above it, custom fields. I don't know why I told you that. There you go. Go to name custom fields. Yep. And then. This is where I went and I did it. Okay. Okay. Right here. Okay, so see how we have no action over at the right? Okay. So change that one to phone. Yeah, and then so instead of no action, select phone. Phone. And then save. And then the other business phone. Yeah, because what I noticed is like normally when it's a phone field, You got like your click to dial type of things or open an email, and it was just like a regular text field. So that's probably why it can't. The Zoom portion email. Yeah, that's probably why it didn't recognize it. Okay, so then the other one is email. Mm-hmm. Yeah, if you don't make a change here, it's just like text you type in. Okay. So it looks like that last one, Zoom business email, that would need to be an email field as well. Okay. Email. Save. Okay. Okay. So now let's go back to that person's record. And we'll want to reload. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. So next. So email address. There you go. Zoom. Oh, okay. So then I can choose here. Is there a way I can just delete all of these ones or not? Well, some of those are technically things that were provided, and again, you know, many years ago, but we can't take them out. They're kind of like part of the database structure. It's just they're older. That's why you got something like AOL and Hotmail. But we can't really take them out because they might have been used. because I know we were a while back we were working on like getting like you know these fields that we don't use anymore so I know I would have to go in and search like does anybody have you know email AOL and then I can delete that or or these built in in the back end and I can't delete them there there are certain fields that are they're going to show up as custom fields even though they're part of the real database structure it's just they're not part of the main table. So these email fields that you're seeing, typically the ones like capital E with the underscore, those are built in, even though they're not part of the main table, which is why they show as a custom field. Same thing with like the social fields, like you'll see like social underscore LinkedIn, social underscore Indeed, social underscore Zoom Info. So they're really stored in another table, but they're part of the database. But that's why they show. So I can't I can't delete those. Can't actually. The only ones you can remove are the ones that you have added under system custom fields. Okay. All right. Okay. Well, that answers, I guess, this question. And then I did run into, and I don't know if you know this, but I was in, I'm just going to bring it up. like sometimes it will um not show up okay so i don't know if you can see this word document so i was in this emily ayers okay and the zoom was grayed out and i was like okay but i went into zoom and she is there it's based on you only see the option when the email address field is populated because I believe that's what they do the check on. The person has to have an email address. So you might need to check if Emily's email address field is populated. Okay. So see how it's grayed out. Yeah. So see email address is empty. So even if it had a one in there, so let's just test the theory here. Yeah. You might see it then, but then it probably wouldn't find a match. Okay, so it's looking for first name, last name, email. I believe it's really just email address. I'm not really sure. Okay. I don't know if it considers first name, last name, but I know the email address has to be populated. All right. I believe I was. Yeah, let's see. I don't remember if it's. See, and now it does. And now it does it. So it just has to have a character in that email address. Yeah, it won't try to check if the email is empty, from what I remember. Okay, so if I go there, next. I mean, and, like, I've already put her Zoom stuff in here, but I was just like, why, you know, I need an explanation of, you know, why are all these grayed out? Because we're trying to just update the database, and I didn't realize, is there a way I can tell it not to look for an email address? or is that something I can't see? No, this is all based on email address because that's really the only unique... thing for us to just do this like oh let's just update this one record so that's why we use email address because that's going to be what's most unique because otherwise if you had like john smith if we did it based on name alone i believe with no email like there could be a ton of john smith and you could make it very easy to update the wrong record so for this feature because it's really just kind of click update it has to have an email address and that's probably why things are really going right out really bad yeah yeah so okay because that's why I get out of this and then remove that one from that record okay I don't really try to use it yeah it seems like it's really stuck because that just number one yeah it's stuck right now yeah like it's not knowing what to do I think it's what's going on yeah I'm gonna I'm over it. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm over it. Okay. So while I, okay, so that, you know, so the next question I have, so we're using the new PCRM, okay, as well. I'm piggybacking because, you know, Nick kind of brought us onto it and, you know, things like that. So I do have, like, one of the questions that I do. All right. Come on. Load. There we go. All right. So one of the questions that we had was when we're in a record in PCRM. If I'm in, you know, Emily Ayers, you know, in the old PCRM, I could just click on her LinkedIn. Where is the LinkedIn profile on this? Scroll down. Well, this is all customizable based on how you configured it. So you would have to add social underscore LinkedIn field probably to there. I don't think there's an option automatically, but I always hated that sidebar thing at the left anyway because my eyes are too old. Is it grayed out or is it green? I always added what's called social underscore LinkedIn to my layout. Okay, how do I add that? So if you go to your edit option to customize your view, so go to a name. Okay, just go to a name. here okay and then see that little pencil icon over next to default view over at the left all your layouts are they're not like customized options at the right those are just more like actions so see where it's under your workspace tab right here called view pencil that's your edit layout okay and then the field that you would want to add in here is called oh there it is social underscore LinkedIn oh actually hold on that's a different custom that's a different field than ours. Okay I would probably also add another field and use social underscore LinkedIn. Is that how they display it? Social underscore does it have the LinkedIn icon what is it display different let me see do I have that in mine yes oh that is it okay that is it so So I don't know why they're displaying it that way. I'm going to bring that up to them. Because sometimes when people do imports, they don't name it correctly. And it really is important for us to see what the actual field name is. I don't like how they did that. Because sometimes people are like, oh, I have a LinkedIn field. And it's like, yeah, but that's just called LinkedIn. Ours is called social underscore LinkedIn. But it's like usually social underscore, then LinkedIn is one word. but that's the same thing as the way I'm seeing it in mine. So let's just hit the X to get out of that chain. No, no, no. Okay, we're there. Okay, go ahead back in and scroll down under here. I believe it's under the contact information right there. So you could see if it's populated and you should be able to jump out from here. Okay, all right. So that's if you don't like where the field is located If it's located, you can move it around. Okay. So that's where it is. Okay. Yeah. Okay. That's where the whole thing is. It's like, okay, where is this so we can go to their LinkedIn? Because normally, like, you know, on this one. You see that sidebar? Right. Right. It's just, you know, it's just right there. So, you know, we're trying to learn, you know, like this new PCRM, and it's just so much different. Yeah. And the other thing with it, by doing it in the layout, there is more than just LinkedIn now. So, like, you could do your Indeed, your Zoom info. Like, when you're collecting those links, just put them in your layout. Okay. So, I can just modify the layout? Yeah. And then just do it. Yeah, we're doing it more field. All right. So, in order. Okay. So if I wanted to add a field, I don't want to add a field. So you're in your page. You go into your group. So go up more at the top of that group. You got to scroll up a little bit. Click that gear. No, no, no. Oh, we didn't click that. Configure layout for that group. So PCR 9 is more widget-based. So what you're going to do then is under your contact information, those are your fields that you have. So see over at the right where you got the plus symbol? Over to the right. Oh, here. Okay. Okay. Now go. No, no, no. Go over. Okay. Go over to the. You got to be working in the right to do the customization. Okay. So scroll down. And then. Okay. So instead of middle initial, click the edit. Edit. And then you take your field name. And I believe if you type it, you can just kind of zoom down. So like see how there's other field. Yeah, okay. So it does have all those Zoom stuff that I have. Okay. So this is something I just need to play with. Yeah. And you can even make a group. Again, like how would. You can even make a group or a widget of just your Zoom info stuff. Like there's different things that you could do. All right. So if I wanted, because like on old PCR, it has like update via Zoom and it has a little Zoom. So do I have to create that here? We're not trying to make, I've been told this myself. So don't take offense to me saying this, because I've been told it myself. I keep being told, quit trying to compare it to PCR 9. No, no, no. I'm just, I'm trying to get it like, okay, where can I click on the Zoom? in here yeah so you'd have to put it into your layout you just put the field into the layout and as long as it's recognized as like a url type of field then it should know that you can pop out to it so if you start typing zoom which is probably going to be way down at the bottom like you should then see your social zoom info so i guess that's what it's got to be Yeah, that's the one. To get that little, okay, so social Zoom info, okay. And then I'm going to hit done. Yeah, click done. So then I go over here. Save at the top. No, no, no, no, no. In your configuration, over to the right of the default view. Yeah. Because you're saving, you're modifying a widget that's in that layout. Okay. So then if I go here. So now exit out. Okay. I guess you're kind of in the record. I'm just going to stay there. Okay. So now you have your Zoom field that you could pop out to that field if she had a URL. Okay. Because it's not. Okay. This is where it's getting caught on her email address. That's what it is. All right. Yeah. So I just took that out, right? And then how do I hit save? Me taking out that one in her email address. I don't see a save button. Go up at the top or go to the top right of that group. Top right. Okay, there it is. Okay. So then if I scroll down, if I click it, there's nothing because she doesn't have an email address. Okay. All right. I'm going to have to think about how we're going to – because that's going to be a hindrance if we're just trying to update via Zoom. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So you'll only see that Zoom option if they have an email. If they have an email. Okay. Yeah. So Zoom. All right. And then one last question I have real quick, and I'll let you go, because I know there's other customers. But we have been trying to – right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we have been, like, trying to clean up the database, okay? And if I go to, like, roll-ups, you know what I mean? Is there a way I can retrieve a roll-up that I deleted? Yeah, and other records. It's in what's called the recycling bin. Let me think where they would be in PCR 9. Let me think. Can I just go there from the top? I know like I always even forget where it is in eight. So what I always do is Search system from there. No. Okay, so go down to like the configure option at the bottom left or system settings settings Okay, now it's familiar. Okay now type under the search box type recycling bin. I Just know the name of it so I forget where it's located. Oh, it's under database management. Okay I don't know if they did that though. That's nice for me to remember. So here, this is things that were deleted. Okay. Okay. Roll up. Okay. So that's where they are. How long does it keep it for? It's indefinite. Like if you go back, like you see at the bottom, right? You have 173,000 things in here. Okay. That says it all. okay yeah so here if you go back and you hit restore it just brings it back as it was it's basically rebuilding the record okay all right well now this screen other than how you get to it yeah this screen other than how you get to it is exactly it's still a pcr9 screen um but it's just under here. So if you were in 9 or M, you could just type go to system, type recycling or bin and then you get to this area. And it looks exactly the same still once you're here. Right. Okay. And then you do have filters if you were looking for something particular. Sometimes the filters are super helpful. If you're really like, oh, I know the name of the list, you can use that search description up at the top right. right after all users on the filters. Oh, okay. Search description right there. Okay, I got it. So if you want to, like, you know exactly the name of the letter or the name of the person. Yeah. These are jumped out. Okay. And then the other thing is, let's say you did maybe something by date range. Once you hit it, like, filter, you could select, and at the bottom right there is a delete permanently. once you delete permanently then there is no then it's gone gone no getting it back alright well I appreciate all your help thank you very much alrighty have a great day you too bye",
