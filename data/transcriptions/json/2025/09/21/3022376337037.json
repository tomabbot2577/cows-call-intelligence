When you finish recording, you may hang up or press the pound key for more options. Hey, Ryan. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just circling back with you. Do check in and see how everything was going with PC Recruiter. I got a notification that it's been, I think, 30 days since any activity on your training ticket, so I wanted to make sure there wasn't anything more that you needed. I know you added some users last month, too. I wanted to make sure they were all going well and had the training that they needed. Please give me a call. Let me know how your experience with PC Recruiter is going and if there's any more training that you need. I'm happy to get you in touch with Robin. 440-856-0314 is my number. Once again, Jim with PC Recruiter calling to check in 440-856-0314. Thank you.",
