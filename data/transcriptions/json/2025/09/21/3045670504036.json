    "text": " Thank you for calling Central Executive Search. To reach Gary G. Lombardo, please dial 101. To reach Angelo G. Lombardo, please hold while I try to connect you. You have reached office manager Leanne Devine. I'm currently unavailable, however, you can leave your name and phone number and I will get back to you at my earliest convenience. Thank you and have a great day. Hello, Leanne. Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just to follow up with you. Checking in with regard to the ticket that came into Robin, I didn't know if you needed to update something in your account. It looks like your current signer is Gary G. Lombardo, so I don't, it doesn't sound like that has changed. So in that case, no new agreement would need to be signed. You just need to update the person to whom you wanted the invoice to go to through Robin. But give me a quick call. I'm happy to answer any questions or figure out what else might need to be changed or updated with your account if need be. I'm in all week next week, 440-856-0314. 440-856-0314.",
