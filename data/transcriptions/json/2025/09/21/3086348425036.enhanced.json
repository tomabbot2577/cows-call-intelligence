    "text": " Robin? Yes, hi. I'm calling. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Who am I speaking with? Robin? Hi, Robin. I'm Carla at Preferred Talent Solutions, and I'm calling because I just added a field on our teams in PCR, and the rest of my team does not see the field that I added. I added so I was wondering did I do something wrong where it's only on my signing in. Well your customization okay and I'm so sorry what you're with preferred talent what was your name? Carla. Carla okay. One second Carla Griffin okay so when you go in and what I'm sorry you added a field to what type of record? To the name record. Okay so when you go into that customize screen some users can have the ability to customize records some don't but if anyone does have the ability to customize it's only changing for your username so what you would have to do is then copy that settings to that setting to other users. Are you a full administrator of the database? I think I I am. Okay. So here's what to do. Go to system on your main toolbar. You guys have to be quiet, okay? I'm sorry, Robin. Oh, no worries. It's in there. It's all in there. It's working from home today, and it's like, okay. Okay, so you say go where now? So click system on the main toolbar. Okay. and then what you're going to do is click on users should be the first option if you're a full administrator a system and it's not it says configure record cards okay so you're not an administrator so another user that has that access so when you go to system and go to users there's an area called copy user settings and then under the source username they could pick who they want to copy from which would be you and then under the name record position layouts you would just click name and then they would copy that over to other people what I can do for you I can send you a screenshot of what it looks like but it would be from my own database because I'm not letting Okay. So here, I mean, this would just be an example from my own database. Okay. one second here that's pretty good no no no no here like that yeah that's yeah that's it copies are studying okay source user name baby login and log back out I was just getting in contact with my counterpart. I guess she was able to add it. Okay. Oh, so she just went and put in her own field and her own layout? Yes. Yes. Jessica, can you log out and log back in and see if it's still free? All they would have to really do is just reload a name record, and then it would have that field if it was done right. Okay. Okay. Okay, so everyone sees it now. Okay. Okay, thank you, Robin. Oh, no problem. I mean, since I'm done, I'm just going to go ahead and send you the instructions I was sending over to you. Okay, yes, please. Yes. All righty. And it's on its way. Okay, thank you. Have a good weekend. Okay, you do the same. Same. Bye. Bye-bye.",
