    "text": " Hello. Hey, it's me. I don't want to set him off. I'm so concerned. I've never seen, never known someone be like that. That was kind of just awkward. Do you think I should assign it to you and then you ask him or I should assign it to him? You can assign it to me and I can ask him. That's fine. Okay. All right. And then I say like, hey, I got this and can you teach me? And then I can help you and then maybe he'll feel better. I don't know. I feel really bad for him. Okay, so I am, okay, I added, I already added the AI search serial code. is currently keyword two needs index for Lucene. Okay let's see hold on one second. I think that's really all you need is really just the database name right. database name ODBC I would assume that's all okay these people go think under there no idea what's going on with this one ticket what son and legacy bulk mail okay this 365 server but for some reason like an attachment is being added somehow. Oh, there might be something in their mail server. Isn't there something like every once in a while you come across where they add like extra text but it's all done through their mail server. That's something that we could do. Well no, like the attachment is like the subject it's like a picture of the subject line of the email. It might be something that that their mail server is doing. Well, it's only when they're sending bulk emails for the PCR. Oh. It's adding a picture, but only when bulk emails. Not when they do an individual one? Mm-mm. And I even tried sending it to myself and it doesn't happen to me. You can't really do a bulk email out of Outlook. It's just one like BCC. That sounds something. can you do a bulk email to me and you from and then I want to see what it looks like that's like really strange yeah I'll I'll send it here in a second I actually have to hop on with Garrett real quick oh okay try to capture thing okay but yeah I'll send it to you here in a second I'll let you know okay yeah that's kind of strange okay thank you bye bye Bye-bye.",
