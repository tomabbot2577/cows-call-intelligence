You said you were looking to get everything moving with PC Recruiter. Just wanted to make sure you received that invoice as that was the next step in the process that we were waiting on. Did you guys rescind the invoice? For some reason, I don't have it. Well, it was sent. Let's see. And it's damon.mcneil at yahoo.com? That's correct. Yeah, I will, because this was her saying, did you get it? So you didn't get it. I will have her resend that over. And it would have come from billing at mainsequence.net, just so you know what to prepare for. Oh, okay.
