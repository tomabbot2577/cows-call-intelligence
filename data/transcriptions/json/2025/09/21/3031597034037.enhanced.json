    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Dave Hosmer. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? Not too bad. Not too bad. I'm trying to add a field in here on a custom field under candidate information. You're trying to, I'm sorry, you're trying to add a what? I'm trying to add a custom field. Yeah. Oh, okay. System. System and then custom fields. Mm-hmm. And then it depends what type of record, where do you try to add it to? A company name or a position? I'm trying to do a name, and I select name. And I put it in there, and it didn't save it. I go back into the field, and it's not there. But when I go into this section, I see it in here. Okay. So where are you looking for it after? Like in the layout? Yeah, in the layout. Oh, you have to then put it into your layout because it doesn't know where it should be. How do I do that? Yeah. So once you create the custom field, then you would have to go to any name record. Okay. and then hit the customize option. Customize. It may not be pinned, but if you go up in that menu where you have like save, link to position. You said custom. I'm looking at it wrong, Robin. Hold on. where'd you say the custom is at again? So if you open up a name record and you go into that full menu where it's got like save, go to the three-lined icon at the end of that toolbar. And then you'll see customize. It's a gear icon. I see customize. Yeah, I do. Okay. Okay. Okay. So once you go in there, what you'll do is figure out which group do you want it in. Where is my field at? I already know what group I want it in. Okay. So once you find the group, at the bottom of that group, you're going to go where it says click to set field, and you've got to pick it from the drop-down. And then once you pick it, then you can drag it up or even over to a different group, but then you have to save your layout. Okay, I'm trying to type in the name, what I called it, and it doesn't work. Let's see here. Try again. I found it. Hold on, Robin. Okay, I got it in there. I can drag it up. For EOC. That's right there. Let's try that and just save it. I didn't do that Robin okay that's where I screwed up okay yeah so like you could create a custom field but like I really don't want to my layout or we don't know where it goes so you actually have to put it into your layout okay all right that will work appreciate Robin thanks so much all righty thanks have a great day you too they",
