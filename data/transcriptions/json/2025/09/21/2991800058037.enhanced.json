    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Adam Consiglio out in New Mexico. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Hey, I am working with a form letter, and I can't seem to get the font to change regardless of what I put in the... Oh, okay. And so maybe you can help me with that. If I can get logged in. Hang on just a minute. Sure. Actually, in the hospital. I'm not in the hospital. A friend of mine is in the hospital, and I'm working on my laptop, which is a challenge. Gotcha. But it's not. My login screen is not here. Where did it go to? Maybe I'm logged in. I hate laptops. I don't know how to use the mouse pad. Yeah, those are not fun for me either. I always have to use the mouse. Well, I normally bring one with me. Gotcha. It could be that the hospital Wi-Fi is on a VPN, so it might give you some trouble logging in. We could try clearing the cache. I could walk you through that if the login screen. It's just not taking me. I mean, I pulled up PCR, but the little where the login field is supposed to be, it's blank. Okay. Yeah, let's try. Click the three dots at the top right of the browser. I'll do that. Hold on. Okay. Yeah, I know how to do that. Hold on. Yeah, sometimes clearing cache when you're in a business is Wi-Fi. It works. Okay, I'll go back. I mean, the Wi-Fi is just slow. Let's just take it off. Time to load. I mean, other stuff loaded. Oh, here we go. It's loading. It's got a fan. Okay. That's what it was. Here we go. Okay. Log in. Okay. So I'm logged in. Okay. Can you log in on your side? Yeah. Let me pull up your database. Your username is A. Consiglio? Yeah. Okay. There we go. All right, and you said it's a form letter. I'll go up to system. Yeah, go to the most recent one. Okay. There it is. There we go. It's Impact Player Mortgage Tech Leader? Yeah, and if you go down my Impact Player alert in orange, it's like when I go to change the font size, it seems to change the font size button. What it's changing is it's changing that box that the text is in. Oh, okay. I don't know if that's a coding thing or if it's something I could fix here without having to go back to my coding version. And then I have to go back to my coding version. Let me try to make it work here. Oh, okay. Try instead of selecting the full text, select maybe like – let me try this. Leave off a letter. so don't highlight like the exclamation point and it should react when you change the font to a bigger size and then you could do the exclamation point separately I think when I highlight everything it's it is looking at the box rather than the individual letters and words Did that work for you? Yeah, I must like this for an hour yesterday. That's too funny. Awesome. Yeah. That did it. Excellent. Cool. Anything else you were having trouble with with form letters there? Let me see. Let me change this color. I think it's a little brighter. Actually, white actually looks pretty good. I'll change it to white. Text color. Shoot. text color we have white white ah there we go yeah okay I think I'm good cool awesome all right yeah reach out if you need anything else okay appreciate it Garrett thank you have a good one bye",

00:00:33,989\nI'm not in the hospital.\n\n20\n00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:36,866\nA friend of mine is in the hospital,\n\n21\n00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:38,070\nand I'm working on my laptop,\n\n22\n00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:38,632\nwhich is a challenge.\n\n23\n00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:42,907\nGotcha.\n\n24\n00:00:43,943 --> 00:00:44,558\nBut it's not.\n\n25\n00:00:44,841 --> 00:00:47,233\nMy login screen is not here.\n\n26\n00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,520\nWhere did it go to?\n\n27\n00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:51,351\nMaybe I'm logged in.\n\n28\n00:00:54,501 --> 00:00:55,105\nI hate laptops.\n\n29\n00:00:59,433 --> 00:01:00,720\nI don't know how to use the mouse pad.\n\n30\n00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,746\nYeah, those are not fun for me either.\n\n31\n00:01:04,720 -->

00:01:13,830\nIt could be that the hospital Wi-Fi is on a VPN,\n\n35\n00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,139\nso it might give you some trouble logging in.\n\n36\n00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:19,620\nWe could try clearing the cache.\n\n37\n00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:21,840\nI could walk you through that if the login screen.\n\n38\n00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:23,695\nIt's just not taking me.\n\n39\n00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,400\nI mean,\n\n40\n00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:24,762\nI pulled up PCR,\n\n41\n00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:25,866\nbut the little where the login field is supposed to be,\n\n42\n00:01:25,886 -->

00:01:40,820\nYeah, I know how to do that.\n\n50\n00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,053\nHold on.\n\n51\n00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,875\nYeah, sometimes clearing cache when you're in a business is Wi-Fi.\n\n52\n00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,010\nIt works.\n\n53\n00:01:55,284 --> 00:01:56,067\nOkay, I'll go back.\n\n54\n00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,755\nI mean, the Wi-Fi is just slow.\n\n55\n00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,173\nLet's just take it off.\n\n56\n00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,684\nTime to load.\n\n57\n00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:28,980\nI mean, other stuff
