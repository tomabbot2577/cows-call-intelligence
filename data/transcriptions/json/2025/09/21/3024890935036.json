    "text": " Kathy. Hey, it's Robin. Hey. Hey. I might have messed something up. And I don't know why or how. And I don't know how. I really don't. So MedBest was one of those customers with the sales receipts issues. And they wanted a 10-month plan. So Bill said, well, if you agree to start on August 1st. I didn't want it to be recurring because if they ever try to cancel, I don't want it to be. I want them to like exist so that they're still paid because it's passed off so what i did is i created one and everything was going fine and then i was using the duplicate option yeah and it was putting like a dollar sign after the number that i don't pretty sure i'm pretty sure i didn't put it in there no no take it out because i had to make a i had to make a an invoice earlier and i had a an r in it And I think I put a dollar sign at first by mistake, and then I changed it to an R because I had to change the invoices for JobMatcher so they can repay the ones that came back out of our account because they didn't use their positive pay system right. So all you have to do is manually change the account number. Okay, so I did do that. I did do that, but then I noticed that it used some of the same invoice numbers that somebody already had, which I thought was really odd as well. Well, if somebody else is doing something at the same time, it could get confused as to what's the next number to use. Okay. So you would just want to put in the next number. okay because something for but this is what's really weird this invoice for frontline staffing that it used the same number for yeah wait 2203943 that's like one of them that was an invoice from july 10th so i don't know how it's really using the same numbers um yeah i would change the one that's that's that's duplicated so you don't so it's not really like change it to that one to be an eight you know at the end or something and if it says that number's already in use then change it to a nine you know until you find the next um number so i did 10 of them am i better off making i wonder if anyone else is let me see these other numbers seven how are these getting all like duplicated numbers I don't get it every number I did so what um let me let me see if I go to a new invoice um it's going to give me oh see well okay here's the thing so 22039 that was the number that was done in July that I had to fix. So I changed that number to be the old number with an R so that it would correspond because their payment failed. So I went back and used that number. So if you go to invoices to the tab under sales, it says invoices and you sort by number so that you get the. Yeah. So apparently all the new invoices are getting these older numbers. Well, there shouldn't really be a lot of invoices created right now. They should have already been done. Like is it a big deal if a customer has two invoices with the same number? Is there at least a unique number in the backup? Yes, it needs to be a unique number. So the latest number was 2204. So 2204069, no, that's you. 2204463 was created today, earlier today. So 2204464 would be the first open number. Wait, is it 2204? 4, 6, 4. 2204. 4. Okay, 220, double 4 is 6, 4. 6, 4, yeah. So I got to go in and change each one of these that I just did? Yes, uh-huh, because we don't want to duplicate one. So we have a whole bunch dated 8, 1 already. Why? Well, those must be ones that we had fixed before. We have a whole bunch because they're partially paid. So just the med best ones. I wonder if you can just edit it from this line. That would be nice, but I doubt it. I'm in there trying to change them. I just did the August and September one. That's the only thing I really don't like about it, auto-numbering, is because if there's any change in something, then it keeps that in the auto-numbering. Yeah, I'm like, I didn't put a dollar sign. I didn't even go into that field. I don't know what's going on. And then I changed it after that, thinking it would catch up, but it didn't, I guess. Yeah, I was like, what did I do wrong? Nothing. You didn't do anything wrong. Okay. I mean, I know I could have just done this as a recurring, but I didn't want it to be overlooks that it's owed. That's totally fine. You guys out of state, that's good. For these ones that I... Instead of six months, they let them do it over ten? This one, yeah, we went ahead and did it for these people. They've been around forever. And it was a lot. Yeah, it was a lot. So, it is what it is. and this is on top of their their monthly though right so yeah okay the bill says yeah as long as we're started for august 1st we'll do that so i went and i didn't hear back i'm starting them and yep it is what it i mean this they didn't give any pushback some people are like really nice about it and some people are quite the opposite. It's like, it's your mistake. It's like, well, I read the one email too. It's like, yeah, but you didn't notice it either. Yeah. Well, you obviously didn't point it out, but you used our service the entire time. So yeah. I think like if it's such a big, use the same invoice number. Why is this wanting to do, why is this got an invoice number for that? For which one? I tried to make one. Okay. 70, 6970. So this one's going to be 71. 4471, right? 71. That one's okay. 71. One and then 472. As long as nobody's creating an invoice right now. okay now when I am doing these invoices are you going to do anything about the sales receipts or just leave them as is no no just like I said before we're going to leave as is because I've already adjusted for the income that didn't get made through another way. Okay. Yeah. So I'm just using these notes, and I'm going to put – what is today's date? 7-22. Okay, 7-22. So I've created invoices. in a 10-month installment for $10,396.80 not paid due to sales receipts not processed. Okay. So that'll be in the notes. And then I also added in each invoice as well as in that memo that we see, like, installment 10 of 10, 9 of 10. So that way it's clear for everybody. Although I started to use, say, failed sales. I was like, well, it really wasn't failed. It wasn't processed. But that's internal. so it's good enough yep that's perfect all right so hopefully we got the number back to normal then okay that's great i thought he was gonna do it damn it i don't want to talk about ai tools i don't use it because i think it sucks pcr features nick wants me to do a training with somebody it's like Like what you see in the documentation is really all it is and good luck because it doesn't really work too well for searching for what people wanted to do. So I'm going to be in a searching training. I thought he was going to do it. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3. Okay. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. I'm just double checking myself. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Have you heard from the out helping SC? um no because tino tells me i tried one and then he's like try this email and then that email bounces and he's like oh well you're just going to have to call them well it's supposed to be in mexico right yeah like it's supposed to be his customer you sold them why don't you find out who the person is because right now they're like do we have a web website or something where we can find out a new email address maybe for somebody else or I gotta see what here helping us see they're making payments that's because I've been processing them through QuickBooks because we have their account saved in QuickBooks so their payment works So in QuickBooks, they haven't done anything to do stuff in Biller Genie. So since their account works in QuickBooks, I've been charging those payments. I also have a card on file. Interesting. Yep. What are the ones that we're missing? July so was it 10-69-08 to February quite a few why was this one only supposed to be 4-46 that seems low oh that was a training oh let me see what was in a training ticket maybe that'll help us Tino's are always a mess. I swear to God. It's kind of like Tino, he's not really like a main sequence employee. He's kind of like a consultant. But he'll try to make these weird arrangements, and I'm kind of over it. And Piazzuola would always go, okay. And she'll just say, Tino's are always weird. Like, no, I don't have the time to make special arrangements for one person. like one one customer needed to have the month and the year like the month and each like they're going to pay annually or whatever it was and then they had to have the month in there or something like that oh I know it was quarterly but they needed to list the month rather than just so what I did is I made four annuals and just said January February March they can look they can guess the year based on the invoice date and that's all i'm doing because they were doing a monthly and then voiding those and then recreating like that seems silly that's silly just do four annuals and just say january february march and then the next one going annually on april 1st april may june and do it that way and if they can't figure out the year well then that's the invoice will have a year exactly and if you can't figure out based on that well then maybe you're just special that's my nice way of saying it yeah okay now maybe it's good like their date formats are like off or whatever but i don't know i kind of wish it did melissa i'm sorry i'm sorry okay go ahead leaving so i'm gonna have to um all right touch base thank you okay thank you bye bye",
