    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Betty Serafino. I got an email today saying that my payment was denied. I did have to get a new debit card. Okay. Yeah, I think I sent that one too. And let me first remember what your company name is. Hold on one second. Top Candidate Recruiting. Ah, okay. Thank you for that. here with me one second I'm just pulling it up it's a wrong section hold on one second I'm almost there sorry about that okay yeah so that one was it rejected so what it's probably easier for me to do is just kind of turn off auto pay for you if you want to give me the new card I can set this up for you okay so let me at least do this for you because it can't some people get a little confused like when you want to replace the card you got to turn off the auto pay on the one so I'm going to turn that off, and I'll delete this card that you have. Okay. Okay. The one that you had ends in 6558. That's the only part I can see. Correct. You want that one gone, right? Okay. Correct, yes. All right. Now, do you have that invoice by any chance? No. All I got was a note saying that my payment was declined. Okay. So here's what I'll do. I'm going to resend you that invoice now. it'll come from billing at main sequence and then when you get that invoice it just came in wait a minute wait below it i did have something just a minute yes i have an invoice okay because i just sent you a new one and you could just use the view and pay option in there to pay it from the new one yeah okay or either one when you have the view okay i just got the new one Okay. You and Jay? Yes. Okay. And then when I put that in, it will automatically have that as my card? Yes. And then, yeah, you should have it. Enroll in AutoPay will automatically be in there for you. All right. So you kind of just got to re-add the new card details. Okay. Not a problem. All righty. I just think it's easier to kind of delete it out first so that way you don't get stuck in a loop like, oh I got a turn off auto pay on that card before I can delete it and that we don't know if it's like multiple cards and everything so those are all out now okay uh-huh all right okay okay I have already I just did that see if it comes Okay. It takes a moment for me to see anything. Setup failed. Setup failed, huh? Yeah. Okay. Let's try this again. And you do have to go through, I believe, you know, put in like the zip code and all that kind of stuff. Let's see. Okay, I've got everything in there. Oh, my name's not right. Okay. Okay, let's see if it goes through this time. Yes, it did. Okay. Let's see if I can see it. Okay, I see the card stored. Okay, and I see auto pay is on. And then it looks like it did process the invoice. You should have also just received an email receipt. Yes. Okay. You are all set then. Okey-dokey. Thank you. Thank you so much. Have a good week. All righty. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
