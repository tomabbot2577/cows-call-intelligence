    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Merritt. How may I help you? Yeah, this is Todd Eikenberry. I'm a customer with Elite Recruiter. I'm trying to like get some source whale hooked up on my PCR. I'm talking to the guy in like literally five minutes actually now. I thought he said I needed to get like an API code or something. So I was wondering if you could help me quickly do that or if that's a long process. It sounds like he's going to help me set it up. He's from SourceWale. Okay, yeah. So they'll basically need your username and password in PCR, something called a database ID, and then the app ID and API key. Those are not very – they're not necessary anymore. But if you need to enter something on their end, You could just type in API key, all one word, no spaces, no caps, and then app ID, all one word, no spaces, no caps for those parts. But they're kind of like dummy text. They're not really necessary. So it's all lowercase. Yeah. API key, lowercase, and then app ID, lowercase. And where do those go for the, I'm not familiar with it, so there's like a section that says API key and app ID and I just put those in those sections. Exactly, yeah. During the setup process, they may require those. But the main ones you'll need is your username and password for PCR and then a database ID. So let me show you how to get that really quick here. Do you have PCR open? I do. Okay, so if you go to system in the main menu up at the top. Give me one second. Sorry. Okay. System. Awesome. And then on the left, scroll all the way to the bottom. Third from the bottom is API. Give me one second. I apologize. I was logged in too long and it wasn't working. Oh, gotcha. So my username is Ike, I guess. This is hilarious. I couldn't remember what my password was before. I'm going to have to just try to figure that out, I guess. I think I guessed. Okay. So there's no way to see what your password is, is there? Just like, you know what I mean? If you have it saved in your browser and it's auto-filling for you, there's probably a way in your browser settings. Are you on Google Chrome? Yeah. So if you go to the three dots at the top right of your browser, and then go to Passwords and Autofill, and then Google Password Manager. Dude, you're like a – okay. Let me just see. I think I know it anyway. Okay. I see you're recruiting. There it is. Dude, you're like crushing it. Oh, now they want to pin for me. Oh, that's – I think that's – No, we got it. We're good. I got it. Okay. I'm good there. Now, real quick, PC recruiter system. Joe, you said down to the third one from the bottom? Yeah, API. Got it. Perfect. And then to the right of that, click on API settings, and that'll give you the database ID, which will have kind of like a period in the middle of two phrases. It says Elite Recruiters dot Elite Recruiters. Perfect. Yeah, exactly how that's notated is what they will need on the source whale to connect to your database. However, the spaces are there. The periods are. That's really weird. Okay. Awesome. And that's all you'll need. If other things come up, feel free to call in. But that's usually all that you'll need for source whale. Okay. Thank you. Awesome. Have a good one. You too. Bye.",
