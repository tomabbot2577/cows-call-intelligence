    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, this is Ernie Bivona. Hi, Ernie. How are you? I'm well. How are you? Oh, pretty good. Good. I am trying to add somebody, and I think I went too fast because I wanted to have the model user after somebody who's already in the system. Oh, okay. So I... Yeah, if you already saved the user but didn't copy user settings, you can still do it. You just have to go to a different place. If you go to system and go to users, instead of going to the manage users, go to copy user settings. I'm looking for that. I don't see copy user settings. I got users, configure record cards, presentations, form letters. Do I go under? They have to click. Oh, there it is. Never mind. Never mind. Yeah, you have to click users first, and then you go to copy user settings. Mm-hmm. All right. And then where it says source username, that's who are you going to copy from. Got it. And then what you'll want to do is make sure you have each of those headings expanded. You typically want to copy everything except for form letters and roll-up automation plans. And you probably don't want MyPCR either. But do not copy form letters. User record, name, source username. That's – all right. Let's try this first. All right. So select all, save as default. So all I got is user record. Go ahead. Okay. So once you select who you're copying from as the source username, make sure you have each of those headings where it says, like, user records, name, company position, interviews, placements. Make sure you expand each of those so you see what's underneath and what you could be copying. So do I click them all or I don't click any? You want to make sure they're expanded. So I don't know how yours look right now. If they're collapsed where you don't see what's underneath it, then you want to make sure you click on that heading so you see the options underneath it. No, I see that. So what's my PCR? That's like that dashboard where somebody has some custom script. They're literally copying everything over exactly as it is to the other person. So what I would recommend doing is probably select all but uncheck my PCR. And then uncheck copy roll-up automation plans. and then make sure that form letters is remained not selected because you don't want to have same letters with the same name for different users you they would just be global so do you make sure you don't copy form letters I got roll up with it's already not collected not checked all right yeah yeah just wanna make sure you don't check it and then over at the right you would select the user that you're going to copy to now I can I can't pick I can't pick it says select username but I if I want somebody that who is not a model user then you'll first have to make them a model user so go out of that copy user settings screen yeah and then go back to you it'll still be under users click manage users got it click on the person that needs to be a model user that you would be copying settings from and then under where it says security information like right next to their username you'll see the model user drop down i'm so sorry apparently i need some water so where you have contact information security information it's right where you would create the username and password in that section got it okay so switch that to yes and then click save I gotta save it first now I go back up to yeah so up at the top so back go back up to system users copy user settings so now that person that you made as a model user would be an option in that source username drop down all right good enough thank you you are welcome have a great holiday how come you know what you're doing geez that's good well I've been here a long time you are welcome bye",
