    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello, this is Jake with Sanford Rose IT. Hi, Jake. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. You left a message. I'm going to help you with. I'm having some technical issues. that needs help doing setup activities, how to monitor them, how to, we got somebody who when they send an email, it tracks like seven different times and it's like, fuck that. Sorry for cussing. It's been a long day. But we basically I've had that and I get it. But yeah, we basically just wanted to get it to track properly and I don't even know if she's around to be honest with you since 4.30. So let me message her and see if she's even still here. Yeah, maybe I do. Okay, so is it like one of the offices. Do you know who we're talking about? I can see what's going on. I don't know. It's Allison Boyson, but let me... Let's hold off on getting her real quick. Let's just see if we can figure some things out. Oh, it's Sunnyside. Music team integration. Does that sound right? B-O-Y-S-O-N? Yes. Okay. Let's see. Do you want to know her username? Her username should be A-Boyson and it should be MosaicTeamIntegration.com but I don't know what their PCR would be. Let me see. Why am I not getting in here? Okay. I'm going to close a bunch of windows so I don't confuse myself. Okay, so system users. Oh, she just used this admin. Okay. So what did she describe the issue as? I'm going to check her. uh the issue was that like uh emails and phones and the way they track um stuff it's like over tracking like if they send like an email it tracks like five times and they just want like a good way to like you know yeah okay all right so let's see let me see something here i wonder if Okay, figure, there's one mail server. Okay. So, see send email to sent items folder. Okay, that's fine. Okay, wasn't what I was thinking there. So they send one email that writes multiple activities. Does she give you an example of any chance? Yes, she did. Give me one second. So basically, like, with emails, like, if she sends one out, it's like she sends an email out at 7, and it says, here it is, 7-15-2025-12 a.m. Email was sent from Allison Boyce and email was sent from Allison Mosaic team. Email was sent to this. Email was sent from Allison Mosaic team. And it basically just got like six entries for essentially one email. And what we're wondering is we don't want that because it gives the impression that like a lot is being done when it's really just one. So it's the writing of activities though, right? Okay. Yes. Who is the person she emailed? Does she give you an example or what was the date of it? The date was 7-15-2025. Yeah. Okay. Let me go. Let me do an activity search for yesterday. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. And I can give you one of the emails that was sent to. Oh, that'd be perfect. Okay. Tichellem at gmail.com. So T-L-S-C-H-E-L-L-E-M at gmail. Say that again. T-L-S-E-L-L-E-M. Did I hear that right? Tango, Lima, Sierra, Charlie, Hotel, Echo, Lima, Lima, Echo. E-M. Mountain. Yeah. T-L-S-E-H-E-L-L. Let me try doing a search that way, see what I come up with. Thank you. tomorrow okay interesting let's see do you know by any chance if she happens to have the same date does she also use the outlook portal added I assume so, yes. Okay. I wonder if she has PCR mail set to write activities and the Outlook portal. Because I'm only getting two activities for that one email. But that possibly, because one does have an Outlook ID and the other does not. Do you mind if we loop her into this call? Sure. Yeah, I think we just got to turn off a setting in her Outlook portal. Okie dokie then. Let me go ahead and get her added to this real quick. Okay. Perfect. Not a problem. Hello. Hi. How are you doing, Allison? Pretty good. How are you all doing? Oh, I'm ready to go home. but I think I know what could be going on do you also use the Outlook portal add-in the piece or critical and I look okay like when you're when you're in your Outlook like are you able to like do you have the ribbon where you could right-click parse the resume oh I think okay I think I think it would be better if we get a screen share going because not just the email she also had some questions about the calls as well. I thought I forgot to mention that, but I honestly think it'd be better for all of us if we get in a screen share because I think she can show you better what she's seeing and that should give you a better idea of what we're trying to correct. Okay. Yeah. I'm pretty sure. I think I know at least for the emails why it's happening. I think you have your, it sounds like you have the Outlook portal because one's writing with like an ID number and the other ones do not. And so I think one's writing, you have PCR mail and the Outlook portal and in both writing activities. So if we turn one off, then you don't have those duplicating each other. Do you guys have RingCentral? We do. Okay. So if you want to open up your RingCentral app and select video and then go to join. So go to video and then join and if it asks you about joining computer, wait I got to give you an ID number first hold on one second let me know when you're there where it's asking you for an ID number. Is it prompting you yet? Allison, are you still there? Hello? I don't know what happened to her. I think we lost her. Okay, can you hear me? No, we lost her. She's messaging me on Teams. Okay. You can hear me, though, right? Yeah, but I think she did it wrong. I think she's trying to start a meeting. She needs to start a meeting. You can still hear me okay, though, right? Yeah, I can still hear you. I'm just keeping her in there trying to. Okay. Bye. Hey, Allison. and yeah it created a ring central video and then y'all yeah yeah if you're going to exit that what you want to do is when you go to ring central you're going to click video and then you're going to click join that start you want to make sure you hit join it's gonna be a little bit more over to the right so okay so you mean let me first leave the video I already had going okay and then because the RingCentral window that's up is the phone call so I think I have to open the main app I guess. Yes. All right so video on the left here. Yeah and over at the right you'll see join. It's giving me pop-ups that are blocking everything. Okay all right it's a little a little arrow into a box. So it should be asking you for a meeting ID number yes okay meeting ID number is 0 5 0 3 9 4 8 1 0 whoo and I I don't have a whole lot of time okay yeah this one setting it's probably going to be two seconds okay so what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of your screen click share yes it's giving me very strange okay it had some weird audio settings set up yeah you don't need to join the audio or or use camera because we're already on the phone okay so when we have you just in your Outlook in that PC recruiter ribbon about a third of the way over where it says options it's got a green wrench icon there you go right there click on that and see where it says auto activities in the middle okay change that to none because you already have PCR mail set to write it so sometimes if there's even just like a slight difference it might think it was like a quick reply or something like that and might write another activity so if you hit save and close we just won't have pcr portal that tool right there writing the activities we'll just have pcr mail do it so i think that's why you were getting two activities gotcha it's basically duping duplicating the action that the other was doing yeah gotcha so when i was actually getting three um i don't know if you have a thought on that Do you have the example when you had three? Yeah, it's right here on my screen. Oh, let me see. Hold on one second. It's pretty common. The bulk email, I guess, makes sense. I'm not sure I understand the difference between email. Yeah, this is probably related to that too because when you're doing a bulk email, it's going into your sent folder, which is then getting copied over. And I think this is going to fix it. Do you, let me see, do you happen to have me in here? Hold on one second. Yeah, don't. Okay. I would say keep an eye on it for the next day. Like, you know, after you email somebody, maybe wait like five, ten minutes. And you should consistently only see one action tracked. I think with this one, it's basically happening is you're sending a bulk email. It's going into your PCR mail as a send folder because it's IMAP, but then Outlook's reading it there, too. So I think this should fix it all. Okay, so is email received basically its way of saying I received an email in my send folder? Is that what you mean by that? No, email received is when they reply back to you. No. that's what I'm saying is like all of these are the exact same time these three right here you got your scent, you got your trash let me see that one who is this one for? John Beacon, is that the name? yeah, Beacon with an M okay oh I see okay okay and I'm wondering if we should maybe if we could plan a time for tomorrow or something because I I'm pretty tight on time I needed to leave it for 30 I can okay this will probably affect it yeah if you're still having an issue after tomorrow let's just let me know you can send me an email my email is here I'll send you an email and that way you have it okay perfect because the other thing is that like this top one that says email that actually shows the content of the email is very useful and I don't know how to make sure I keep getting that and I would also like to get that for a one my SDR but yeah then I also had a bunch of like other questions about setting up activities and how calls reported in your call reporting is ported into activities from RingCentral and stuff like that yeah the RingCentral what we do with them is we just check through an API connection about every 20 minutes and if it finds that there was a a call to or from a number on your that's in your database that writes an activity. That's kind of all we're really doing is just pulling the activities but any kind of real like call log like how long were calls and things like that that would you would have to go right into your RingCentral portal. Yeah it's more the translation of the activities because it's unclear. Yeah we just write either like I think it's a inbound and outbound and then next to it in that status column it gives a little bit more detail I really like that like we can find some time to look over it in more detail because like I can't I can't really explain very quickly you know like okay this outgoing call that doesn't look like what it is voicemail doesn't showing up I'm not sure what that's about you know that that kind of thing I'd like to have some more time to go through and I see your training with Jason okay I'm going to have Jason reach out to you to schedule another training that you have okay looks like you have a little time left okay okay all right I'm gonna have him reach out and you should be hearing from him sound good yeah alrighty we'll have a great evening and just keep an eye on this email activity let's let's uh let me know if that works but as far as you know scheduling more training going over your activity types I'll have Jason follow up on that for you sound good okay alrighty sounds good have a good night you too thank you thanks bye bye everyone the caller has disconnected the line goodbye",
