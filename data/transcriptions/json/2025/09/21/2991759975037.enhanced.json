    "text": "Thank you for calling Eric Wald. Please hold while I try to connect you. Good morning. This is Eric. Good morning, Eric. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I got your inquiry through our website. Thought I'd give you a quick call. Hey, let me tell somebody I'll call them right back. Sure. Hey, Dean. Yeah. I'm going to have to call you back. All right. How are you? Oh, I'm doing very well. I'm doing very well. You good? Excellent. Well, listen, I'm with Sanford Rose and I've been a PCR for some time. I am looking at trying to find a tool that will help us with the business development aspect of it. And Brian Denton, our IT guy at SRA, had said, hey, have you looked at PCRM? like what the hell is PCRM? So I looked and I found PCRM and that's why I booked a call. Excellent. Yeah. It's our new CRM product. And the cool thing about it is it's a separate CRM, but it runs off of the same technology, the same database as PC Recruiter. So it enables you to share the database. So you could actually use PCRM for your marketing purposes and PCR9, which you use now for recruiting, or maybe you eventually start using PCRM for everything. So it's kind of designed to maybe be its own standalone product someday, but right now it basically does everything PCR9 does, but adds a sales pipeline, simpler sequencing, some different things like that. So yeah, I'd like to see more of the functionality of it. I've been looking at Crelate. I've looked at CPAL. I'm really leaning more towards Crelate than CPAL simply because they have that business development aspect where it'll go out and search for open positions and notify me in the ATS. Does PCM have any of that aspect or is it just keeping track of those deals? just keeping track it doesn't have any technology to go find open positions or anything like that so it's just going to be basically a deals pipeline so you can use like yeah but it looks different but it works a little bit different to track a deal a potential relationship with a new client okay all right and then what is the what charges are different than what I pay now what it does it it adds It's $10 to your user, so it takes you from, I think, $50 to $60. And then it's $3.50 one time to set it up. And that $3.50 turns it on, creates that second link, and includes four hours training. So you get trained up on the new system, and it just shares the existing database. So you can still use PCR9 and PCRM sharing the same database. Okay. Yeah, I'd like to learn more about it. I mean, I think the deal pipeline would certainly be a benefit for us to analyze the business and have an understanding of the funnel automated. So, yeah, I'd like to see more information about it and I'll bring it to my team. Okay. Let's maybe pick a time tomorrow or Thursday that we could run through a demo, maybe 20 minutes or so. When I send you the invite, I'll also send the website for the PCRM product as well. And I'm pretty open tomorrow other than 1 p.m. Eastern. Outside of that, I'm pretty open. Okay. Let's do something tomorrow afternoon. I'm mountain time. What are you? Okay. Eastern. So I'm a couple hours ahead. Okay. you want to do say 1230 my time, 230 your time yeah that'll work for sure let me email you a zoom and I'll also throw the website to the PCR on product and we can speak tomorrow 230 my time and take a look around excellent, can you do me another favor include Deia D-E-I-A at let me shut my door on that invite I sure will. Excellent. Perfect. I'll send that along. Thanks. Appreciate it. Talk to you tomorrow. See you. Talk to you tomorrow. Bye now.",

00:00:23,472\nGood morning.\n\n4\n00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,390\nThis is Eric.\n\n5\n00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,352\nGood morning, Eric.\n\n6\n00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,650\nIt's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter.\n\n7\n00:00:28,702 --> 00:00:29,880\nI got your inquiry through our website.\n\n8\n00:00:30,082 --> 00:00:30,979\nThought I'd give you a quick call.\n\n9\n00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:34,451\nHey, let me tell somebody I'll call them right back.\n\n10\n00:00:37,465 --> 00:00:37,709\nSure.\n\n11\n00:00:41,768 --> 00:00:41,950\nHey, Dean.\n\n12\n00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:43,746\nYeah.\n\n13\n00:00:45,968 --> 00:00:47,439\nI'm going to have to call you back.\n\n14\n00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,283\nAll right.\n\n15\n00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:52,335\nHow are you?\n\n16\n00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:53,832\nOh, I'm doing very well.\n\n17\n00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:54,696\nI'm doing very well.\n\n18\n00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:55,160\nYou good?\n\n19\n00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:55,604\nExcellent.\n\n20\n00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,845\nWell, listen, I'm with Sanford Rose and I've been a PCR for some time.\n\n21\n00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:11,031\nI am looking at trying to find a tool that will help us with the business\n\n22\n00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:12,134\ndevelopment aspect of it.\n\n23\n00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,731\nAnd Brian Denton, our IT guy at SRA, had said, hey, have you looked at PCRM?\n\n24\n00:01:22,563 --> 00:01:23,893\nlike what the hell is PCRM?\n\n25\n00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:27,890\nSo I looked and I found PCRM and that's why I booked a call.\n\n26\n00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:31,577\nExcellent.\n\n27\n00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:31,887\nYeah.\n\n28\n00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,873\nIt's our new CRM product.\n\n29\n00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:36,586\nAnd the cool thing about it is it's a separate CRM,\n\n30\n00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:37,870\nbut it runs off of the same technology,\n\n31\n00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,873\nthe same database as PC Recruiter.\n\n32\n00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:43,920\nSo it enables you to share the database.\n\n33\n00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:46,646\nSo you could actually use PCRM for your marketing purposes and PCR9,\n\n34\n00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:48,149\nwhich you use now for recruiting,\n\n35\n00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:51,156\nor maybe you eventually start using PCRM for everything.\n\n36\n00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,884\nSo it's kind of designed to maybe be its own standalone product someday,\n\n37\n00:01:55,904 --> 00:02:03,576\nbut right now it basically does everything PCR9 does,\n\n38\n00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:04,317\nbut adds a sales pipeline,\n\n39\n00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:04,878\nsimpler sequencing,\n\n40\n00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:05,559\nsome different things like that.\n\n41\n00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,010\nSo yeah, I'd like to see more of the functionality of it.\n\n42\n00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,157\nI've been looking at Crelate.\n\n43\n00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:14,330\nI've looked at CPAL.\n\n44\n00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:18,344\nI'm really leaning more towards Crelate than CPAL simply because they have that\n\n45\n00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:21,689\nbusiness development aspect where it'll go out and search for open positions and\n\n46\n00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:22,490\nnotify me in the ATS.\n\n47\n00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:35,940\nDoes PCM have any of that aspect or is it just keeping track of those deals?\n\n48\n00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,331\njust keeping track it doesn't have any technology to go find open positions or\n\n49\n00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:45,579\nanything like that so it's just going to be basically a deals pipeline so you can\n\n50\n00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:51,154\nuse like yeah but it looks different but it works a little bit different to track a\n\n51\n00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:56,401\ndeal a potential relationship with a new client okay all right and then what is the\n\n52\n00:02:56,401 --> 00:03:02,305\nwhat charges are different than what I pay now what it does it it adds It's $10 to\n\n53\n00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:02,960\nyour user,\n\n54\n00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,600\nso it takes you from,\n\n55\n00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,256\nI think,\n\n56\n00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,240\n$50 to $60.\n\n57\n00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,660\nAnd then it's $3.50 one time to set it up.\n\n58\n00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,404\nAnd that $3.50 turns it on,\n\n59\n00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:12,460\ncreates that second link,\n\n60\n00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,780\nand includes four hours training.\n\n61\n00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,720\nSo you get trained up on the new system, and it just shares the existing database.\n\n62\n00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,980\nSo you can still use PCR9 and PCRM sharing the same database.\n\n63\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,440\nOkay.\n\n64\n00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,740\nYeah, I'd like to learn more about it.\n\n65\n00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,437\nI mean,\n\n66\n00:03:28,437 --> 00:03:33,214\nI think the deal pipeline would certainly be a benefit for us to analyze the\n\n67\n00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:36,080\nbusiness and have an understanding of the funnel automated.\n\n68\n00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:42,460\nSo, yeah, I'd like to see more information abo",
