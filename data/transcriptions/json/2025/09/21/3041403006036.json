    "text": " Jim hi Jim this is Robin Mentoni with main sequence how are you well get some in a bit of a pickle here yeah we get so we sending invoices and said like we switched billing system so it's sending you invoices that you have to go in and kind of putting your new card information I guess security wise we couldn't transfer that information over oh yes yeah you have to like authenticate it, kind of, you know, like put it in. So that's why those are still open. Okay. I haven't even – I actually closed the business. I've been maintaining the database just sort of part of a contractual obligation, but that's sort of up by now too. So that's why I haven't even been logging in or anything. So I haven't even noticed. Well, these would have gone right to your email address. Yeah. No, that's what I'm saying. I'm not even – it's my work email. So I'm not even checking into that. I apologize. I did see it about a week ago and tried you guys then, but I think it was too late after hours or something. So I apologize. Just had some things going on personally that have taken my attention. So when did you guys switch? Back around April, I think it was. Okay. Okay. So what do I have in terms of bills, and can I just take care of it with you over the phone here? Yeah, let me see. So two of them got a late fee applied. I can take that off for you. Hold on one second. Thank you. Let me take that off. Oh, one of them got two of them. Okay. Okay, let me fix that one. And the other one. Does one late fee apply? Okay, so let me make sure this thing's over before I do anything here. So there... It takes a moment. Sure, no problem. Sure, no problem. Got to do a new total. Okay, so there's four invoices for $88.66. Okay. So the total is $354.64. Do you want to give me the card, and that way we just set you up on auto-pay again? Yes, please. Okay. All right. So let me add the card, add new card. And then what is the name on the card? James E. Butler. Of course, E is the middle initial. Okay. And the card number? 3-7-3-9-9-6-3-6-3-3-9-3-0-0-2. Okay. Excuse me, 9-3-0-0-8. I beg your pardon. Okay. The expiration date? Is 12-25. Okay. And then the security code on the card? Is... Hold on, just let me make sure I get this right. Oh, wait, this is on the front. That's why I'm looking at the wrong number. Yeah, that's an American Express card. It's usually on the front. Yeah, yeah. 1781. 1781? Okay. And then are you still at 1706 Oleander Place, Davis, California, 95618? Is that still the address for the card? Yes, everything's current on there. And, yes, that's the address for the card. Okay. I'm gonna pop that up, okay so what I can do do date and turn that on okay so what I'll do is I'll auto-paint these Okay. And you should be getting receipts emailed to Jim at informaticserch.com. Okay, great. Okay. And then there's also, like, whenever you get, like, the invoice and stuff, there's, like, a link where you can sign up for our customer billing portal. It's nice about that. If your card ever changes or, you know, like, it's about to expire, you can just go in there. You'd have to first create a billing account for it. and then you can go into the vault area and replace it with a new card. Okay. Well, like I said, I've closed down. I actually retired a couple years ago, so I'm going to probably see if I can get the data downloaded and then probably cancel the service in a little while, but I've been procrastinating so long I don't know when that's going to happen. Gotcha. It all depends on your contract terms too. What's that? It all depends on your contract date. Yeah, I think Jim just told me that I could just call and cancel. It depends on the contract dates. Yeah. So we have it all straightened up now, and then I will get this cleaned up here on this side. And it's all set now. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. All right. Thanks. Bye. Thank you.",
