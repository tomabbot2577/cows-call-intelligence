One, I have an invoice here that says it was not paid that I paid on the portal. All righty. I would have to get you over to billing for that one. Did you have another? Well, I'm trying to see if there's an issue with somebody from my office calling so they couldn't get into our system. I wanted to know if there was any issue with it because of billing. Well, let me take a look here. No, there's no issues on my end. I can get right in to the database. What username should I be using and all that? My regular one? Everything's fine? Yeah, your regular one that you normally use. could you ask Robin to give me a call when she gets a chance yeah I could transfer see if she's available and transfer you to her that'd be great yeah give me two seconds here I'm just going to put you on a brief hold while I see if she's available well it looks like she is on another call what i could do is i could transfer you to her voicemail and then send her a message as well you got it all right transferring you in three two",
