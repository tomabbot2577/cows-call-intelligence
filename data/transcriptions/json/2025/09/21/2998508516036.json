    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I have a billing question, and there wasn't really an option for billing, so hence, I have you. Yeah, no problem. Let me transfer you over to billing. One second. Okay. It looks like they're already on a call currently. I can transfer you over to Robin's voicemail. She's head of the billing department, and she can get back to you as soon as possible. Sure. And I'll also just leave a message for her. Let me see here. What was the company you said you were with? Action Management Services. Okay. I think I tell you, is there a Monica or something like that? No. Yeah, no Monica here. Maybe it was Robin that I talked to last time. Oh, yeah, could be. Yeah, no worries. Yeah, I'll just send you over to her voicemail and then let her know that you called. I appreciate it. Thanks so much. Thanks. Have a great rest of your day. You too.",
