    "text": " Hello? Good morning, Lenine. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good. How are you, Jim? I am well. I had you down for 10 a.m., and I dialed into the Zoom, and I waited a little bit, so I thought I'd give you a quick call, see if it still worked for you. I'm on it now, and you're still on it. I was like, damn it. I even perfectly accepted this morning, and I was like, oh, my gosh. I must have just popped out of the call because I'm still in the meeting. I just hung up the call, and it must have been the second you joined in. So that's so funny. So are you able to pop back on or no? We can just stay on this call. The Zoom's still here. I can share the screen if we need to. So that'll work. Okay, cool. So yeah, so I wanted to just kind of show you on PC Recruiter a bit. I wanted to see kind of what you were looking to see or what initial questions you had. I think you said you were an app looking to maybe offer this as an integration point or something. Correct. So basically what I'd be looking for is, number one, is it at a price point? Could we figure something out where it would be at a price point that would make sense? Or how does it normally work when people are doing the API integration? You kind of tell me how that's worked in the past and what prices they would be. Okay. Well, list prices for our system are about $1.15 per user per month. Now, we might be able to work a little bit cheaper than that, but they would need to have a PC recruiter account in order to essentially click on an API. So we do have an open API, so something could be written. And many times clients would write something to our API we don't even know about it. And so it's relatively simple to do, but they would need to have an account. We'd need to see, I don't handle our partnerships. I have another guy on staff here who handles the details of those. It kind of works a lot more with that. Well, why don't you show me? I'll tell you a little bit about us first. So my husband and I developed an app. We're going to have a series of apps that are basically the same thing, the premise, but they're highly specialized for the marine business, basically. So the first one that's out is marine service companies, and the next one will be specifically for yachts. So that would be charter, that would be yacht broker management, et cetera. But just on this side, the reason why he wanted to develop this app, he actually started it in 2007, believe it or not. The reason why is because there wasn't anything for his companies that made sense. Like, it was just too hard to try to get it normal, normal apps or even software before apps was just software, right? They were designed where a person or an address was the file. In the marine business, a lot of times you don't even have that. You have a yacht, and that's all you're dealing with. Like, let's say you're the certified outboard for a Suzuki servicer, right? you're just doing 100-hour, 500-hour services repeatedly. So it's the only difference is the actual boat or the motor. So that's really why it's really hard in the marine industry to find software programs that work for you because you're just making shit up. You know what I mean? Like there is no Mrs. Jane Smith and whatever. But anyway, that's our back story. and that's why actually I'd be interested on twofold. One would be just for his company, which is Rock Solid Yacht Services, and if it works and it was something that was truly great for their company, then it would be something that we would be interested in to offer other people inside the app. So that's kind of where we come from. So if you want to walk me through what it looks like and how I could visualize this, I'm a visual person, how I can visualize how it would help. Sure. And you're looking to kind of track hires and candidates and positions and job openings and stuff like that? Correct. Yep. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. Let me share my screen and kind of show you around just the basics of how this will work. I'm also going to show you two different interfaces because we actually have the PC Recruiter Classic, which is what we're looking at right now. It's been around a number of years, used by thousands of recruiters in every industry. We also have a newer PCRM is what it's called. So it's more of a CRM product, but it has all of the ATS products, like the tracking features of it as well. So it is basically an ATS, which it's got a newer interface, so it's kind of a nice thing to look at. So I'll show you the two side-by-side, or actually I'll kind of open them up both and kind of see which one you might like to better explore. Okay. Since you're kind of visually taking a look at these here. So this is the basic classic PC recruiter. It's going to be something that is going to run on a PC or a Mac. There's a mobile app, too. And you can access all of your information. Main menu bar at the top. Middle area is going to be for searching, search results or lists. Its bottom area is going to be for the records themselves. And the three main record types we handle are going to be names, companies, positions. So names, names of all your candidates, maybe names of your contacts. Companies are going to be names of the companies you're working with, the companies you're recruiting for, your clients, maybe even potential clients. And the positions, of course, the jobs you're looking to fill. So that's going to be kind of how everything would work. And here, the different interface, the PCRM model, is going to be a little more up-to-date. Now, I'm going to log into the exact same database. They share a database, so you can actually use either version. They both come as part of the package there. This one has the menu down the left-hand side of the screen. Same thing, names, companies, positions. You have your daily schedule, your lists, everything like that. And I can go into a name. It's going to let me look at my most recently viewed names. If I want to look at Andrew K. there, I can click his little icon. It'll slide in from the right. So I have a customizable workspace. I can put whatever fields I want. So here's a nice place where if you were looking to track boats, motors, experience, certifications, something like that, you could build a workspace right here that would be only the fields that you choose. You could even create a block of fields based on that person's job experience or that person's mechanical experience or anything like that. That way when you land on that page, maybe you have a resume or maybe instead of where that resume is You're going to have a block of fields with their experience where they are where their base where they work what they do It's all going to be searchable data as well. Okay So it's all going to be searchable data So yeah, like I said, they're two they do the same thing Like I can't even look at Andrew Kay in here same exact person same exact record My record looks a little different but I have all of my different fields. And I also have a nice activity tracking block here that's going to show everything for every email I've exchanged with him. Even if I'm moving through an interview process, I can track every interview as I go. Okay. Okay. Can you show me, like, let's say I want to integrate this into my website and it says apply here. What does that look like on your side? Do you have somebody who's integrated it? I have a few sample sites here. Okay, great. So, yeah, so that's our job board piece. works with either version so you're going to be able to pick from one of these templates so if you wanted it in the list format or a table format or maybe you preferred a more information like to put more info on the initial list you're able to kind of pick from one of these templates you could embed this right into your existing website no matter what it looks like cool thing about that is when a position is entered into PC recruiter when the position is open with one or more openings it's automatically posted to your site so that's going to be real time and then you're able to pick up maybe you have a formatted description here and a couple other fields and that's again pulled directly off of the position in PC recruiter so if I look at like my lead engineer I'm going to be able to see here's the different fields maybe I have a description all of this information this one you'll see is showing on web on the web so you're going to be able to see it's showing online right there it's kind of in green so you could see so you can kind of pick one of these and when you have the posting on your site candidates are able to hit apply you can turn this on or turn this off you can essentially have them sign in with LinkedIn or indeed or Google or something like that that's going to help make sure they're not already in your database so if they find it with LinkedIn it'll just ask for their LinkedIn password and credentials PC recruiter takes a quick check to make sure they're not already in your database then you don't get a duplicate if they are it'll simply attach today's application to their existing record or if they're not it'll go to the next page and then you're able to put in a custom application I just have a few very basic fields here but you can put in specific fields specific questions they can upload a resume upload references anything you want a lot of leeway with this and as soon as they hit next they're entered into the database a record will be created for them so I would be able to go into a record I could look at Andrew in here I could see that I have a record in here of his information maybe I would have a resume if I had one on him and then I would also be able to link him to a job so if I look at my positions if I was looking at that lead engineer position I was just looking at I'm gonna have a pipeline in each and every position and that pipeline is going to give me the capacity to set up a custom interview process within PC recruiter you can name your stages pick your colors and then you simply the inbox over here is going to be everybody that's applied online and as you maybe I had a phone screen with Donald I'm gonna drag him over to phone screen doing that it's going to create that searchable trackable reportable event in PC recruiter so you're able to kind of tag that to his record so if I look at Donald Kane I can jump right into his record that is going to have created an activity automatically phone screen right there and then he also is going to have his own individual pipeline so I'm going to be able to see I have an individual pipeline showing everywhere he's ever been late how far he got when it happened who did it that cetera I got okay and so but and it was cool this so when you do that if I go into a different position I can look at a different interview process so you have the ability to have different pipeline processes this one's a little longer a little few more steps so you can set that up any which way you'd like you're also going to have reporting in the system here so I can go into analytics and this is going to let me see maybe I want to build a metrics metrics report showing all my pipeline activity in this report I chose to show only first interview second interview and phone screen but you could choose to show all of your interviews and you're going to be able to show maybe you want last year this year last quarter this week you can even split it up by what job you've worked with or what client you've worked with It's all very interactive. Okay. And so for the 110, explain that to me. The user is the company or the user is – if for each company, for the most part, you have one person doing the hiring, right? So the 110 is for that person in HR or the 110 is for – is there any additions to the 110 is basically what I'm asking. Yeah. Well, it's for – basically, so let's say, for example, that your husband wanted to buy a PC recruiter for his company, one person was going to be primarily using it, that would be one user. So it's going to be the HR person, the recruiter, whoever is doing kind of what we've been doing here, putting in the jobs, moving people through the process, communicating with the candidates. That would be the user. And you could be just a one user for $1.15 per user per month. And our setup is $7.50. So there's also a $750 setup that creates the database, It offers assistance from our web team to help hook it into your website. It includes 10 hours of training from our team to get you up and running and utilizing the system. It includes access to the OpenAPI. It includes access if you wanted to hook it into your Outlook, your Gmail. We've even got a little app that will pull people in from LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, all sorts of different sites as well, ZoomInfo, Zing. So you can kind of import information as well. So one company would pay $7.50 one time and then $1.15 per user per month times however many users they needed to be, but they could even be just one. We don't charge per company or per job or per posting or anything like that. Okay, so then go back to the part where about the names. I guess my question is, so you already have people in your system that you're able to access. Is that what I'm understanding or no? No, it would be a blank database. The end user would need to fill it up. You can parse resumes, pull people in from LinkedIn, have people apply online through that online application that we looked at, or you can parse in a spreadsheet. So we include, as a standard feature, the ability to parse in a spreadsheet and just parse all the data into the system so you can get it in kind of populated quickly that way. Okay. So I guess my question, the only way, the $750 plus the $115 a month, so basically in the first year you're paying somewhere around $16,000 for the service, correct? So, well, $115 times 12, so you'd be, yeah, $13,000 plus $750. So, yeah, you'd be looking at about $2,100 for the first year for one user. All right. Sorry, I said that. I was a little bit off though. But anyway, all right. So, and then after that, obviously, it's just that, is there any other annual fees that I'm missing or is that pretty much it? just the per user fee. So if you were still one user for the second year, you would only pay $1,380, $115 per user per month. Now, you could add users. So if you needed to add a second user, you brought in a new recruiter, anything like that, that would be it. Maybe you had two users at $115, but the only increase would be directed by you, and it would be just if you needed to add users or anything like that. But you could drop users, too. We're flexible. Okay. That sounds, I mean, that's pretty straightforward, especially if you do all the training. Yeah, I'll bring it. And you don't have another company that you could just show me what it looks like on their website, like a regular website? Well, actually, I think our website might have that. I don't have one just at hand. I just want to see how easy it is when you click apply here or whatever well let's see if our I think our careers page I know it's set up with our oh let me turn it off okay I don't know so let's see I don't know if anyone like I said I can email you someone if you'd like I can email you a customer site or two but yeah so I will email you a couple customer sites you can see it live kind of give it a click, see what it's like, see how easy it is. And I'll kind of send two that might be a little varied so they look different at the different sites and everything like that. But I'll talk to my web guy and find two good ones. And do you have a dark view or whatever it's called? We do in this version. There's a dark view. In the PCRM version, the newer interface, there's not yet a dark view, but I believe one's coming. Okay. All right. Perfect. All right. Sounds good. I look forward to receiving that, and I'll keep you posted. I'm going to talk to Kevin hopefully in the next day or so I will send it over in a little bit alrighty thanks so much thank you have a good one you too bye",
