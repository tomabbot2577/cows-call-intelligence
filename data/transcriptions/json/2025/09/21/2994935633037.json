    "text": " Love this, Brian. Yeah, I was hoping you could help me. I use PCR, and I was just looking at PCRM and trying to figure out what exactly it is. So I wanted to see if there's somebody I could talk to to find out more about it. Sure. Yeah, so who am I speaking with? My name is JP Wright. Hey, JP. Nice to meet you. I'm Brian. So PCRM is simply a new version of PC Recruiter. It is not a direct replacement for PCR9, which is what you are using today. It is designed to be utilized in conjunction with 9. So let's say, and I don't know what your office situation is like. if you have 10 people in your office, five could be on M and five could be on PCR 9. What PCRM is designed to do is for our clients who have embraced sequencing and the premium package, email campaigns, analytics, mostly sequencing, it is designed as a lighter weight, easier to use, easier to implement one screen, not a split screen solution for your folks who are really, it's designed for the folks who are spending four to six hours a day on the phone. It will not have some features. And that's why I'm saying it's definitely not a direct replacement for PCR 9. For example, right now you can't merge records. That's one thing that I'm lobbying for to get, you know, updated in PCRM because I think it's a pretty important thing. But there's a lot of admin stuff that happens inside of PCR that will not be in PCRM. And so, again, the concept is it's designed to be for the folks that are on the phones the most versus your admin people. So you may have admin people on 9 and your sales people on M. You may have your younger people on M and your more experienced people on 9. You know, it just depends on which way they, you know, if you have a $500,000 biller and they like nine, you're not going to move them if they don't want to go, you know, that kind of thing. So that's basically it. Are you using the premium feature sequencing, email campaigns, that type of thing? No, not really. But I'm looking at SourceWale. I think SourceWale kind of does a lot of that. Yes. If you're familiar with that. Mm-hmm. And that is in PCR. So, you know, you could try PCR sequencing if you wanted to. Completely up to you, obviously. So what we have, does it have sequencing in it? Yes, you have sequencing. You have the ability to add sequencing to PCR9. and the premium package and so forth. But there are some features of, for example, here's a really good example. PCR9 has our standard sequencing, okay? PCRM has our standard sequencing. PCRM also has simple sequencing. In a nutshell, simple sequencing is easier to set up. You can quickly throw together, you know, an outreach campaign in two or three minutes versus having to sit down and think it through something that would be utilized for the entire office, you know, with all kinds of options. And if they'd say this or if they do this or if they request this, we go down that path. So sequencing, you have a lot of options as far as how you want to set it up. And if you want to have a complex sequence that manages a lot of automations and things like that, you can set that up. But in PCRM, you also have simple sequencing, which allows you to just set up a blast email, a phone call, and maybe a text message on the back end of it, something like that. Real simple, real fast, and get that, you know, out the door. Yep. Yep. Now, I haven't looked at the sequencing since we – because we really just haven't kind of gotten full-fledged into it, even though we've been using it for a few years. You know, the sequencing was pretty – at the time, it was pretty simple stuff, and it was very kind of canned. And, like, for a business development sequence for us, like, it's not exactly easy to just come up with a, like, a cut, you know, a 40-cover business development sequence. So we just haven't used it. But now that I'm, you know, we're looking at trying to use it more. So are you telling me that you guys also offer a better version of sequencing too? Well, so as I stated, PCR-9 has our standard sequencing tool in it. PCR-M has our standard sequencing tool in it also. PCR-M also has what we're referring to as simple sequencing. So it allows you to set up a sequence without really having to think through all of the complete options. And, you know what I mean, if I just want to set up, you know, a blast email and follow-up phone calls, I can quickly set that up and I'm off to the races. Whereas with standard sequencing, you have to kind of sit through and figure out exactly how you want to set that thing up and with all the different options. There are use cases for the standard sequencing solution, because sometimes you want to go that route. And there are use cases for simple sequencing. And I have found that the simple sequencing does help me with my – because I do recruiting, and it does help me with my recruiting. Okay. Okay. All right. So, like, one of the things that I liked about SourceWale was, like, it prompts you to do things within LinkedIn and, you know, like LinkedIn messaging and, you know, connecting with people through LinkedIn. Like, is there anything that you guys have that does the same thing? Yeah, so in simple sequencing, one of the options is going out to LinkedIn and reminding you to send a connection request or send a direct message or a LinkedIn message. There's four options there. I can't remember exactly all four options under LinkedIn, but those are options in PCRM also. Okay. that. So this makes something dumb, but like where do I go in to like look at the sequencing within PCR? Well, we would, so what would make most sense is for somebody, one of our salespeople to demo it for you. And then you can determine whether or not it makes sense for you. And then we can turn it on. It's a upgrade package that you would need to upgrade to. Oh, okay. So what I have does not have sequencing in it. Most likely. I didn't pull up your account, but there's a good chance that it does not. Okay. So I would have to pay extra to get that turned on. Correct. Just like you pay extra for sourceware, you'd be paying extra for that functionality as well in PCR. Yeah. Okay. is there any way to look at my account to see what we have and how much extra it would be to turn that on see here JP, I apologize. I'm having computer issues as we're speaking on the phone, and I can't get into my database. Okay. Can I get your phone number and give you a call back once I get past this issue? I apologize. It's just bad timing. Sure. What's the best number to reach you? 724-396-648. Yep. Okay. All right. Let me reboot my computer, see if that fixes the problems, and I'll give you a shout right back as soon as I have updates on your – oh, wait a minute. Hang on one second here. You do not have sequencing as part of your package. Okay. We can set up a call for you to take a look at PCRM or the sequencing features within PCR9. We can do that. So do you have any idea how much it is to turn it on? I guess that would help me figure out if it... Because I remember whenever I did the demo with you guys, that was one of the things that the sales guy's name was Ryan. I think that was one of the things that he showed me. But I guess I thought it was something that was already included, and we just weren't using it. But it seems like it's not. It's something that's a... Yeah, we have our enterprise package and the premium package. That's part of the premium package. Okay. And you are paying $72 a user. You would be looking at an increase of $25 a user for the premium package. Okay. Now, do all of us have to upgrade the premium or can we pick and choose? Okay. No, it's across the board. Across the board. So that would be $75 a month on 12, 750, what is that, like $900 a year? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, I could probably schedule a demo to take a look at it to see if it's going to do something that is very similar to SourceWale. And I'm assuming you guys know SourceWale, too, so you would be able to help me kind of compare the two a little bit. Yeah, we know. I mean, we've never used it, but I'm familiar with SourceWale. We actually even have a partnership with them. I know that was one of the reasons that I looked at it because yep and if you want to use PCR in conjunction with source well obviously you can do that and take advantage of the inner the the integration that we have with them or you can like I said consider the the sequencing that's within PCR yeah yeah Yeah, why don't I go ahead and schedule something to have somebody walk me through it again because we're obviously not using it. So I'm sure it has also changed in the past few years the way that it works. Sure. What about next Wednesday? Do you have anything sooner? My next week is kind of a mess. All right. I would not be able to do anything sooner, but I might be able to get somebody else to do that for you. Let me see if I can get one of my peers to – what would work for you? I have time later this afternoon. I have time tomorrow. Okay. All right, let me see if I can get an individual to be available for you either this afternoon or sometime tomorrow and see if I can get that coordinated for you. Okay, that'd be great. All right. Excellent. All right, either I or somebody else will give you a call back and schedule a time for you for the PCRM. All right, I appreciate it. Yeah, no problem at all. Wait, PCRM or sequencing, or is it the same demo, basically? Sequencing is part of PCRM and part of our premium package, but it's also part of PCR9. So sequencing is sequencing. You can have that today in 9 that you're using today. You would still have it if you opted for PCRM in the future. Gotcha. Okay. So by seeing the demo for sequencing and – by seeing the demo for PCRM, you're also seeing the demo for sequencing. Yeah. Whoever takes you through it will show it to you in both packages, 9 and M. Okay. All right, good deal. I assume that that same person is going to know both of them either way. So whichever we need to focus on, they'll be able to help. Yes. Okay, cool. Yeah, that works. Okay. All right, somebody will be in touch with you shortly. I appreciate it. Thanks, JP. Have a great day. All right, thank you, too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
