    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, good morning. I was actually trying to get a hold of Patsy Lombardo. I think I selected the wrong option when I was in the automated directory, though. Oh, she's no longer with the company. Is there something we can help with? I was trying to find somebody to speak with with regards to equipment financing and leasing for the company. Oh, okay. Let me see here. I'll transfer you. Oh, go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to say, do you know if anybody would have taken over Patsy's responsibilities directly or if there's like a CFO or a new controller or anything like that? Yeah, we do have a billing department. I can transfer you over to that. That'll probably be best. I'll just transfer you over to billing and we'll probably be able to get you into the right spot. Perfect. Thank you. All right, and transfer me now. Just reach out if you have any other questions. Awesome. Have a good day. You too. Thanks.",
