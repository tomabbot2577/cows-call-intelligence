    "text": " Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi, is Kathy available? Yes. Is this Robin? Yes, it is. Okay, hold on just a minute, please. All right, thanks. You're welcome. Thank you. Hold on just a second. I've got to try and get my... Can you hear me? Yeah. Yep, I can hear you. Okay. I have a few customers to review with you because I owe them answers. Okay. Let's first start with Job Bank because you just emailed me again, and it was an issue from last week. customer's name is Job Bank dash Montgomery County Job Bank Montgomery County okay okay if you go to the invoice dated 1-1-25 you'll see they made a payment after that but look at the invoice so they're wondering why they're getting this balance and it looks like money was added but then tax was added on top of it so it's like the 1900 dollars or whatever the balance is and they're actually tax exempt so that that was not supposed to be a positive number uh somebody made a mistake because it's supposed to be yeah it's supposed to be um wait they're tax exempt yeah so it's not only are they tax exempt that they're he says they're not supposed to be charged tax at all but they're applied tax as a positive number and then tax applied at the bottom so they really got taxed twice well now making it look yeah yeah the discount was supposed to be a negative number so that it offset the tax that was calculated on it. And they shouldn't be charged tax anyway because they're tax exempt. Yes, they're tax exempt. Okay. So I want to do this one to you because the 1283280 was the correct number and that's what they paid. Yes, yes. I'm going to get out of the invoice now that. Hold on. That way only you are in there. So let me just say, I see the customer tax exempt at the top. Okay. I don't know how we missed that. Well, I added that later because I didn't even know. I added that customer tax exempt. Okay. Just so that we saw it going forward. Yeah. We'll have to adjust that because we paid tax on that because we didn't know that business services was actually a tax exempt thing. So, yeah, I fixed that. Okay. All right. So I will go in. I will email him back. Yeah, that was a mistake. Sorry. let's see so I'll just go over to QuickBooks or not QuickBooks I'll go to the Biller Genie pull them up and reach and send let's see Montgomery I won't even do it that way I'll just go this way I'm gonna just show them like one that it's showing that it's paid now okay All right, so let me do this. Invoice number. I sometimes wish it defaulted to all. Export to PDF. Okay. Save it. Okay, so what is this? I see Job Bank, Montgomery. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay, so that is one. Okay, so he is done. I can get rid of his. Who are the other two? Okay, we'll back up here a little bit. I just sent you another email about somebody that's going to have to be reimbursed for risk work. For what work? Risk, R-I-S-K W-O-R-K It was one of those where we had modified the recurring and then somehow an edit updated the recurring back to the original number of users. Okay. So the invoice, let me know when you're there. I am on there. Okay, so the invoice dated 7-2 should have been for 78-23. I already changed the recurring but there's no notes do you mind just making a note about the correct users there we don't put users there they change all the time oh I see that's right nobody ever really used notes nobody really used notes that much I've been starting to use it more when it's like a cancellation or when I put them on hold or typically user change, we just go into the recurring because their next invoice should be whatever their new rate is. We don't usually touch the existing invoices. Well, that's part of the problem, though, too, is that the recurring ones were all, since nobody touched it, they didn't notice when it wasn't working right. Yeah, like when somebody does a user change, we don't change their existing billing. We just change it going forward, which is why we just go into the recurring. So when somebody's editing an open one or something from the transaction list, like an actual invoice, I think, again, they're hitting that update recurring. And if we do something, I always do it separate. Yes. And I think when we were trying to get all the sales tax updated because there was all kinds of wrong accounts associated with it, I think that's why. I believe we've gone through all of those now so that we shouldn't have that issue. And then I've got, you know, Dana was looking at, like, all the ones this week to see if we had any, you know, that could potentially have gotten changed. And then we're just going to keep looking, you know, on the current ones just to make sure that we try and catch any of those that might have changed and changed back. But QuickBooks has drives me nuts. So, we need to make a, we need to credit this one, the risk work. They need a refund, a refund of 156.45 for risk work. Because they went from three to one. Okay. Yep. So the refund is $156.45. That needs to go back to their card. Well, but then the problem, so I have to figure, the partial refund is a pain. I got to figure out how to get that working right. because on one part of the website it's really easy to refund but it wants to refund the full amount and you're a fun little amount and then we just reprocess for the existing voice and the reprogram the right oh yeah I could do that and then just charge them the right amount yeah okay yeah yeah all right so So let's do the 234.68 from the 7 to 25 payment. Yep. And then should I go ahead and change the invoice while you're doing that? So one user? The recurring one? I already did the recurring. I already fixed the recurring. Okay. Well, then hold on just a second. So let me just make sure I can do this the way I'm thinking that I can and make sure that it goes through for the whole refund. And so that was just last week, right? Yeah, 7-2 is the date. Yeah. Okay, 234. I'm going to re-sign that. Do you want me to send a refund receipt to the customer? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, because they're, like, getting on me. They're not too happy. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that happens. We don't like it to happen, but we're going to fix it. Okay. So I just sent that. Let me. So there's that refund. So let me create that refund receipt. And they had, they had, they were being billed for three users or? They got billed for three users in July and it only should have been one. Yeah, and they have PPI as well? Let me... If the PPI was on there, then it needs a standard. It just needs the amount adjusted. Yes. I'm trying to do it the way it was. Let's see, to back it out. So, let's get it on my second screen. I can click on the right thing. That's $75 a user. So $234.68 is what we charged. That's what we just refunded. Yeah. So the new invoice is a total of $78.23 after the PPI. yep so I'll refund and then we'll do the new one at 1 so 7823 is the correct invoice okay so we'll do that. Okay so we refunded the full amount and then just charged them for the correct amount at one user. Okay what else? Okay so the other two that I had sent over, let me just make a note to these, I don't want to do it on that Hold on one second. I'm going to have to follow up and let them know. Okay, so that was for risk work. Refunded, two, wait, full amount, and reprocess for one. Okay, so the next one is going to be Advent Search Group. Advent? Yes, A-D-V-E-N-T. Okay. They went on hold, and they got billed for their regular amount. So this 7-7 should be somehow their regular one got reactivated, so I reposed it. Mm-hmm. This 7-7 process should have been for $20 only, not $103.23. Yeah. So refund at $83.23? Yeah, but I prefer to edit that invoice to indicate a hold fee. Do you want me to refund the whole amount and then do the hold charge like we just did the other one? yeah and let's edit the line item okay so let's see so this one is Advent I'm going to add that search group. Yes. So I'm going to add that search group. Yes. So I'm going to add that search group. Yes. So I'm going to Okay. Portal charge. No, it just needs to be hold fee only. Yes. Well, I know, but I need to refund it just like the invoice was and then create the new one. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And then what do I do? So this one was on 7-7, but technically the $20 hold fee is usually on the 14th. So do you want me to charge the 20 now or wait till the 14th? Oh, yeah. They already paid for that. Yeah, let's go to the 14th. Okay. So we did refund the 103. So I'll just wait for the regular recurring transaction to happen on the 14th. Okay. And then void or delete or do you need to do anything with the 7-7 invoice or no? I did. I I've refunded it okay that's that one will stay there it says paid and it says closed and then though you'll see a refund if you refresh age got okay yeah so we don't want to get rid of it okay got it okay and That's probably my mistake around the dates there. Let's see. And it is due. Okay. And then the other one was Probitas, or how do you say it? P-R-O-B-I-T-A-S. Buddy Ben Williams, who's... Finally, current after pretty much almost always being behind. Hold on just a second. I'm sorry. So I don't know if I heard you right. I can't find that. Are there any spaces? Is it P-R-O-V as in Victor? P-R-O-V as in boy. As in boy. Okay. Thank you. Pro-B test. Okay. Okay. So this one, I went ahead and modified the recurring back to three. and it does have a PPI, but he was charged on July 4th for his previous user amount. Yeah. So do we want to apply the overage to the next month or want to refund him? No, he's going to definitely want a refund. He's so cheap. Oh, from $300. Okay. From $547. $547. $547. Okay. So how much did he owe actually? The $3,2855. Oh, so it's not a five users, it's supposed to be three users. Okay, so $219.03. Okay. That's the probitis. Okay. Yeah, he's already whining because he got charged, like, multiple invoices. Like, well, you've been owing them. We've been telling you you've been owing them. We've, like, threatened to, like, shut them down. And he'll laugh. Yeah. He'll, like, yeah. So I'm sure this name might be familiar. This is one we are always chasing down. Okay. Okay. So let me look real quick and see if I got a final update from Randy about the partial refunds. Oh, he said I should be able to do it now. There was a setting that wasn't in there right. So he said he fixed that setting so that I could do that. So let me... Is it like they can't make partial payments? Like pay one voice and apply to all? Yeah, I couldn't make a partial refund. So it was kind of a pain. Let me see if I can do it now. on this one on 7-4. We want to refund him 2-19-03, correct? Let me pull out a calculator. calculator. We billed him 547 58 and he was only supposed to pay 328.55 219.03 yeah No. Provides history. Okay, now it says errors to 1903. It tried to do it and then it says error. me um oh So it has an error. So I'm checking with Randy. And so that one I'll figure out how to get that partial refund. And then the other one that we had just done, that we said we needed a partial, did we? there was two of them we ended up refunding completely yeah or was risk work and risk work and advent were refunded completely yeah one of them we went ahead and reprocessed the other one we're just going to wait because the date was wrong anyway and then probitas is one that we just have another problem with. Which was the one that we it was a difference of 156. Was that risk work? Uh that would have been risk work. That's risk work. Okay and so we did that one um completely and Advent um that one's refunded the 103.23. So it's just a probitis that I have to figure out the partial for. Yeah. Unless we want to try just refunding everything and then reprocess it. Well, I'd like to know if I can fix this so that we can do those a little easier. That way there's less transactions back and forth. Okay. because you know when we get fees you know and stuff so if we can do it a little more precisely that would be great is it was there any others though well then the other one was the one about the taxes we got that handled I do have another one but she just told me like put it on the next thing so I'll I'll just make her next invoice now and put a credit on that one. That was a different customer. So, yeah, you want to create the next one with the future date, and then you just want to go in and apply that earlier payment to that invoice as well. Yeah. Now, do I have to do it as a credit memo, or can I just do a line that has a negative as credit? Does it really matter? Please do not do a credit memo because the original payment over payment, well can you tell me what client is we can look at it together for Tina Foster I haven't done anything with her yet sure oh I'm sorry techno smarts is one word sorry Megan T E C H N O techno smarts but it's all one word okay thank Thank you. OK, TechnoSmart had an invoice of $281.61. Yeah, she is supposed to be probably what the previous one. It's supposed to be just like the June invoice. The 187? Yeah. Wait, let's see. Did you know I just correct for two users? Let me make sure here. Yeah, it's supposed to be two users, and it went back to her previous amount of three. Okay. And it's only supposed to be two. Okay. So I've already fixed the recurring. Okay. And $93.87 is what she technically overpaid. So probably the easiest thing would just be to modify this July 1 invoice and to put it back to two users so it's a smaller amount. and it has an overpayment to it. And then you can apply the overpayment to the next invoice. Okay. How about that? All right. So let's change this invoice to two users. Okay. So are you doing that or do you want me to? What do you want to do? If you want to do it, that's fine. Okay. So two users and then the PPI is $180 then instead. So her total is the 187.74. Correct. And with the payment she made, she has a credit of 93.87. Okay. So we'll fix, we'll change that. And then if you refresh your page, you'll see that it'll show she has an open balance of negative 93.87. Okay. So if you want to go into the recurring transactions into that drop-down menu, tell it to use. Okay. And then create. And this is going to be the 8-1. Okay. So we're going to say use. Change the date to 8-1. Okay. And then you should be able to just save it. Save. Got it. Save and close. now in my transaction list and i go to receive payment right well you can go to the payment that's already in there the one from 7-2 if you go to that payment on 7-2 and you edit that payment and you select the other invoice as well so you select the second invoice it should populate the 9387 on that second line. If it doesn't, you'll have to overwrite it. Okay, let's see. So that... This transaction is linked to others. Yes. So you're not changing the amount received. You're just putting the... You're checking the box for the second invoice on 8-1 and making sure it says 9387. Okay, well, hold on. The amounts received plus credits can't be less than the selected charges. What the heck? So are you in the 7-2 received payment right now? Let me get out. Leave without saving. Hold on one second. I was. So 7-2, I've got the credit. So I went over to, yeah, I'm in the payment. I go to view, edit. Yep. I don't change the date or anything on here? Nope. I just select it. I have an invoice. Okay. The 8-1 invoice. and the payment amount in the window on the right should say 93.87 so that you don't change the amount received. Customer balance. The first one should say 187.74. The second box should say 93.87. So I got to edit. I do have to edit that. Yes. Okay. If it filled in the whole amount, you have to edit it. Okay. And then so amount of credit should be zero? Yes, it should still say $281.61 is the total payment. For amount to apply and then amount to credit zero. Yes. Okay. Let me make sure that did it. And then when you refresh, it should show that you have, you know, a partial amount paid. It's partially paid. Yep. Yeah. Partially paid, 90 something. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. All right. All right. So that was fine. And then I got to go over the recurring and bounce that back to skip the next page. I'll ask that. Yeah. And skip next. And I think I should also take this pays by check comment out because maybe she used to, but it looks like she's been doing cards now. That way we don't get confused. Yep. Okay. If she happens to send a check again, then we'll add that back in. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright, so okay, we just fixed this. Your invoice stated 8-1-25 will have a partial payment, so it will only be Okay. And voice stated 9-1-25. Back to, okay. All right. I think we're good for now, right? other than the probitas, or however you say their name. Yeah. Probitas. Okay. Yeah, and I'm working on getting that one partially responded, yeah. Okay. All right. Thank you. Let me know when that's done so I can just let them know. Sure, of course. No problem. All righty. Thank you so much. All righty. Bye-bye. I can't even find my phone thing again.
