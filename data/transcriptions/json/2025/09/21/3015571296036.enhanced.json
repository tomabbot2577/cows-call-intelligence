    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. My name is Connie Rose. I am in your software. I'm a new employee, so I'm new to PCR software. So I'll be calling. Do you want to call and hear you again? I'm with Alexander Raymond, part of Financial Recruiters International. Okay, wait, let's see. I'm not finding you in here. Okay, I found like a different one. Bonnie Rose. Yeah. We got a few companies. Okay. How would we have the company? I'm under Alexander Raymond, but the parent company is Financial Recruiters International. Maybe under that. I have it listed that way, financial recruiters. I don't have you in the database and ours, at least. Financial Recruiters International. Okay, that's not the right one. If you look at the URL of your login page, it ends in ODBC. What do you see? Let me shut down this page that I'm in. I have saved it. There's a two at the end of this link. I'm inside a basic search is where I'm at. Where should I go to try to get you that code? So if you look at the top of the page that you're in, there's a URL that takes you to your login page. It starts at www.pcrecruiter.net, and it ends in ODBC, followed by, like, okay, what do you see after ODBC? It's under Connective Services. Oh, okay. So that was you then. Okay. All right. Let me open that up. Yeah, okay. So I did have a Connie Rose of Connective Services, but, okay. That's me. Yeah, that's how we have you listed. Okay. so what can i help you with i reloaded i've got to go back in and find my this is an unusual name so i might be able to find her maybe just a second i'm gonna go to phoenix phoenix is right here go to names i just say that why is that name not coming back up but it doesn't matter i'm going to ask the question okay i'm just going to open up the other the one contact i'm having there under preferred communication every time i try to do this um when i click well hers has already done it but normally when i click on it and i check it i can't get it to stay so should i just enter or after i do my check marks or what am i doing I honestly I'm not able to tell what the issue is by the description. Can we do a screen share? We can. Okay. Do you happen to have RingCentral? I do. You do? Okay so if you can open up your RingCentral app probably be the best way to to do this. It's open. Okay go to video and then select join. Okay. I'm still in that. I'm in week two, and all these pop-ups come up, so it takes me a minute. I'm in video where I can start, schedule, or join. Yeah, click join. Okay. I'm going to ask you for a meeting ID. Let me know when you're ready for that number. I'm ready. 050-394-810. 050-394-810. There I am. There you are. Let me open up video. Okay. And so... Okay. And you can turn on video and audio since we're already on the phone together. We're just going to see your screen. Okay. If you click share at the bottom of your meeting screen, and then make sure you select entire screen. Yeah, I'm looking for that right now. Oh, here it is. Right at the top. Okay. Can you see that? Okay, yeah, now let's show me what's going on here. So this right here is correct under this Donna. Okay, I added and I refresh the screen I say did I hit the Save button, I added a second person. Let's just name sake here. Let's do this. The names I don't know why they didn't say that is crazy. I made a big effort to save it. So here we are in a new one. Down here, where it says preferred communication, I'll just re-enter it. Preferred communication, for this person I'm gonna enter, she did her text, a work cell, a work email. So I do wanna select all, but I don't wanna deselect all. So I thought just I'd hit enter and it would save it, but it's not doing that. Okay. So let's exit out of here for a moment because you'd have to create the whole record to create this person. Okay. So let's exit out of here. Let's go into one of these existing people. Okay. So let's go in and let's go into that field. We can just kind of add it, save it, and then take it out. So if you click in that field, add personal self for just a moment. Okay. And then click your save icon, which is right after their name and company. It's that floppy disk icon. Up at the top here? Yes, that's your save. Okay, so that tells me how to do it. Yeah. I was thinking I could do it in time. No, you have to either hit save, or maybe if you click over into another field, then enter might work. you probably have to get out of that field. No, I tried that. I tried the interesting thing. So now I know. I mean, like email other maybe like click into another field so that you're just out of that box and now hit enter on your keyboard and you'll see the screen flash and then you can tell that it's saved. Okay, cool. I got you. I got you. Thank you so much. I appreciate you answering the question. Sometimes when you're in that field, you kind of got to go out of it. So if you kind of click somewhere else, like maybe into another field, then enter on your Keyboard Works. Otherwise, just grab your mouse and hit the Save icon. Right. Thank you so much for your time. That helps me a lot. You are welcome. Some places you can type it in and it saves it. In other places, you've got to just hit the Save. And you know, and you know, it might also help you to see at the very top right of Peace Recruiter where you have your user image. Go into the gear icon that floats at the edge of that and then go down to user preferences. Okay. Okay. Expand that heading that says navigation configuration. okay you do have your save alert on because usually what that means is if you um navigate to another page and you didn't save it'll at least alert you so it might have just been like yeah you do actually have to save whether it's hitting enter on your keyboard or yeah or if you want to hit that button but if you just kind of save it automatically we don't do that because sometimes people type stuff, they change their mind. And so it doesn't save it automatically. No, I know. It gives you an option. Once it tells you that you need to save it, there's a save button down toward the bottom. When I was trying to add a second contact and I hit save, I mean, I have learned that rule real quick. First week, I learned that rule real quick. First day, I learned that rule. So I'm just like really confused. I'm like, where did she go? So what I'm going to do is just, I want to do a double check. I'm going to, you know, clear it and just put in, but it should pop up under names, especially here. When you go to names, she's not showing. I mean, this lady's showing. She's the CEO, but her CFO is not showing. And so, fortunately, I hadn't gotten too far down into the... What was the person's name? I mean, did you add it directly from the company or did you try the quick ad it's top right I just did I did it I did add with the plus symbol and then you were in that company and then in names okay yeah so it sounds like you didn't save it then you could also just do a search up at the top right to see if you saved it and maybe send her from company but if you started from the company should be in that company record it should be and I remember this you can see this down here I remember this popping up and I hit say I don't know weird things happen with technology. I don't know. Maybe I didn't. Maybe I just thought I did, but because I am new. And you didn't get any warning about like first name, last name, title, and exact title being required or anything like that? Well, I just got the, you know, you need to save. You need to save warning. And I said, okay. And then I came down here and hit save. Okay. I'm not sure without seeing what happened. I'm not sure either. It's weird, but you know, maybe it's weird because I didn't do something that I thought I did because it's not habit. The software is not habit. I'm playing videos right now. I'm like three-fourths of the way through the videos. But, you know, I'm a recruiter at heart, and so I want to get busy. You're a salesperson, not a recruiter, not an administrator. I get it. Right, but I have to master the software. I mean, I come from a company that I owned for almost 23 years, and I had custom software. I didn't use Google that much. We had all custom software, and we didn't have off-the-shelf. You know, I had it. I had, like, Bullhorn, you know, for over a decade, you know, and you get accustomed to that. And I've heard of PC Recruiter. I know that it's a good system. You know, I know some recruiters, a lot of recruiters use it, and I was happy to learn another piece of software because I like IT. I like it well. My twin brother owns an IT company. So, and he helped me when I was developing, you know, my software that kind of looked like Bullhorn, but wasn't really. It was scaled down to just what our needs were. So, you're trying to make the needs, fit the needs of everybody, of every recruiter, anything they would need. So, your software is really built out in an extensive, where mine was not. You can see. But anyhow, that being said, that customer support number, I'll probably be dialing it for a little bit until I get more comfortable with the software. and I appreciate your time today and you have a wonderful day you too thank you bye bye Thank you.",
