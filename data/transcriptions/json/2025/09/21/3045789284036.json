    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Mike Belogna with Career Building Solutions again. We talked earlier this week, and you helped me through the PCR capture tool. Okay. And for whatever reason, it's not working again. I don't know what's going on with it. It was working earlier, and then it just stopped. I may have messed it up. it was defaulting all the new ads. If I was adding somebody else from LinkedIn, it would add it to my default folder of applicants. Okay. So I don't know if it was something that I did or what. I didn't change anything other than a button that I thought was going to fix it, but then it looks like it stopped working. Okay. If you go to the PCR icon at the top right, your capture, Sure. There's three toggles on the bottom right. Yeah. What's his basic mode? Make sure basic mode is off and to the left. It is that and dark mode are both off. OK. Dark mode. That's just the color scheme. So that's up to you. Capture the default company. That third one. If you want it sounds like you want that off so that by default people aren't just going to your default company. So that would be good to have off. And then that's set up correctly. Well, that was actually set up as to on, but I think that's the change that I made. But go ahead. Okay. Yeah, if that's held to the left, it won't bring people automatically to the default company. So hopefully that will help there. You know what? Both problems are solved. I just had to call you and bet you about it. it just worked. I clicked it on and it brought up the company name as it should. So, um, yeah, I don't know what the heck happened, but I guess I just needed to call and say hi. I don't know. Yeah. Happy to help walk through anything like that. That's good. I'm glad it's working. Yeah, as well. I appreciate it very much. Sorry about you. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Thanks so much, Garrett. Have a good weekend. You too.",
