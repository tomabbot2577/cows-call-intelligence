    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Conrad calling On Point Search Group. How are you? Good. How are you today? Good. So I had a question. I'm trying to link up PC Recruiter with my RingCentral, so I can just push on a button and it dials there. So I was wondering if you could help me kind of set that up. Yeah, not a problem. Let me pop into the database real quick. Sure. Now, are you an admin level user in the database? Yeah, I mean, it's just me. Okay. Using everything. All right. So it looks like it's already enabled for the database. So that's good. Mm-hmm. All right. So what you're going to need to do is in the system menu, so click system up at the top, go to users, manage users. Okay. You'll select your username. Okay. And in that contact information part that you see, that first part up there, where it says contact phone, you'll see a little gear icon next to that. And that's where you're going to click to set up our RingCentral settings. Okay. now where it says phone number and direct dial that's where you're going to put in your uh ring central phone number that they gave you that you're like direct a lot of numbers like it shows up on the caller id or because sometimes i get confused with all these numbers yeah so what i typically tell people is if you're in ring central how there's your like in the ring central app it'll show your initials at the top left um let me go to it um yeah i'm in the app i think i'm on i'm using it right now yeah so like right under where it says file inside the app you'll see like your initials or like a profile picture i see a profile picture yeah so click on that and underneath your name it should say view profile um yep and it'll show you like a direct dial or primary number yeah i see the primary number that's the number you're going to want to enter there okay but you're going to enter it in a that plus one format that it shows where there's no spaces or dashes, just plus one and then the area code and phone number. So I need to put the plus one first. Yep. And like I said, no dashes, no parentheses, just plus one and then the phone number. Okay. I've done this with my mobile phone too. No. Yes. it doesn't track as well. Yeah, okay. You can set it up to push things to your phone, but you have to click a bunch of buttons. You have to have the PC return to their app. You get the app open, probably. Yeah, yep. Okay, all right. So I put that in... Okay, no dash, as you said, right? Yep. Okay, yep. So you'll put that in the phone number and direct dial. So you can just copy and paste it. Direct dial, too. Just bear with me one sec. okay so what's in there and then where it says user phone configuration over on the right and that'll be a little drop down uh wait should i save this first or just where it says you it's in that same box right across where it says user phone configuration right under the extension Oh yeah, yep. You'll select RingCentral App. RingCentral App, okay. And then hit save. Okay. Then let me just double check it here. all right so that looks good now you'll click up in the top part of the navigation menu again where it says my pcr uh okay yep my pcr all right and then on the bottom half of the screen you'll see where it It says like RingCentral status connection issue re-authentication needed. Yep. You'll click on that, and that'll have you log in to RingCentral. Okay. Okay. Okay, it's going to send me some code, I guess. So I can send it to my... Oh. Why is it calling? Let me just see one thing here. Oh, okay. Okay, so just continue to authorize. Yep. Yeah, check any boxes that it tells you you need checked. Okay, so I did that. Then let me just double check on my end here, make sure it all looks good. Yep, and you're all connected. Okay, great. So I can just click it and I'm good to go. Yep. Yeah. You'll see like the phone and text bubbles next to the phone numbers on records now. Yep. Excuse me. It may prompt you the first time you go to click it, like on the web page, it might pop up asking for permission to allow it to open RingCentral. But there's a little checkbox that you can click to say always allow so you don't get that every single time you use it. got it got it okay great I appreciate that one quick question I don't know it seems like you know you know ring central fairly well yeah and maybe I should be calling this them on this I don't know but um does it always how do I go to like the recordings like when I'm recording a call do you know how to so normally when let me see here there used to be a spot for it I believe it used to be like in the call section itself. Like when you're quick on the phone where it says like keypad calls, voicemails, there used, if you click, uh, there's like a little down arrow next to where it says notes. Okay. Uh, maybe I have to hang up to get to it. I don't know. No, you should. I'm looking at it right now, and I'm on RingCentral with you here too. Okay. So like on the actual calling app? Okay. So where it says – because I see notes and transcripts. Yeah, so in the actual call itself. Oh, I see. Like in the actual app. It's in the actual app. Okay. So I see. You'll see phone over on the left. Yep. And then when you click phone, you should see like keypad, calls, voicemail, notes. Oh, I see. And then voicemail. There's a little arrow next to notes. And then when you click that arrow, you'll have access to the recordings. Okay, got it. And it should automatically record unless I do something to it, right? Yeah, if you have auto-recording on for your calls, like if you set that up or they set that up for you when you got it, it'll auto-record all the calls. Yeah, I basically want it to do that. Would that be in settings, would I find that? Is all the recording? Like if I want to make sure it's auto-recorded. Yeah, let me take a look here. so that's yeah that's like a higher end setting that i don't have on mine okay all right well i can maybe get with them on that yeah their help page is usually pretty good too like you might just have to log into like their admin center like if you're the admin for the account and turn that on but they should be able to give them a call or start a chat with them they should be able to direct you to that pretty quick alright sounds good I appreciate it if you need anything else just let us know great have a good one take care you too",
