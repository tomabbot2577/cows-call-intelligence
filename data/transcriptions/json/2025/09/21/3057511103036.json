    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim, can you hear me? I do. Doug, how are you? I am well. How are you? I'm pretty good, pretty good. Thanks for joining me today. So, yes, I wanted to show you around the PCRM piece a little bit. I wondered kind of what you've heard of it. Have you seen it? Have you heard of any of the features included in it or anything of that nature? I don't know anything about it. As a matter of fact, you mentioned it this morning was the first I had heard. But I had been hearing for the better part of two years how, you know, PCR was going to revamp. and sort of remold everything and all the releases right around the corner. And, you know, here I am, whatever, two and a half years later, looking at pretty much the same exact thing that I've looked at for 10 years with rounded corners. And I thought, I wonder if I'm on that version that everybody's been talking about for years. The new release. So that's what prompted my call. Excellent. Glad you did. Yeah. So this actually has been in development for three or four years. They were kind of working with different things here. And it was originally going to be PCR10. It was originally going to be a new interface for the PCRecruiter9 package. It was going to replace and migrate everyone to it, and that's what they were doing. But it kind of, as you know, got delayed, and we were even told many times, it's right around the corner, right around the corner. They actually ended up adding things to it and kind of developing it, and then they added a lot of CRM functionality. They improved the sequencing feature. They added the deals pipeline. There's some new reporting coming out on the deals pipeline as well. So they actually decided in maybe April of this year just to spin it off kind of into its own product that shares the same PC Recruiter database. So it's PCRM is the name of the product. It's a CRM. So PCRM is where they get that from. And that is going to be something that runs off your same exact database but gives you a whole different interface. Now that being said, it adds some new features, but it also contains almost everything that the old PCRecruiter has, just in a new interface, new screens, new format, and everything like that. A few of the things you're going to notice as I show you around here are going to look the same, like the sequencing and the analytics, if you use either of those. Because when those features were put into PCR9, 10 slash PCRM was already in development, so they kind of built them to look the same way in both. why you might notice they look a little more modern than the PC recruiter you use now because they were designed to fit this piece here so yeah let me show you around just kind of give you a walkthrough of what it's going to look like and how it looks and works and everything like that okay great okay so you see my site in screen here you know so this is the PCR I'm log in what I'm going to do I'm gonna log into my exact same PC recruiter database so if you add this you're going to have the same username same password same databases same data all the integrations still work because it's running off of the same sequel database it's just a different integration a different interface actually a different link from which you can access your data and you'll notice right away we've actually gone away from the up and down top and bottom frame we've actually gone and added the menu down the left side of the screen many of the things are going to be the same terminology like you still see names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. All those are going to be very familiar so that's going to make it a little bit easier to use. There are some new things like the files workflow and some of the things look quite different. So for example, if I go into names I'm going to be able to look at the new names search screen. It's going to show me the last number of names I looked at so that's going to be my recently viewed records right there. We've added the ability to edit in line so if you needed to edit or change anything from this menu you can do that here and then we've also added the ability to perform actions right from this main menu so I could go contact and send them an email or contact and call them dialing with RingCentral or send them a text or something like that or I could even add an activity a note add it to a roll-up list submit a profile throw some feedback create a presentation so you can do a lot of things right from kind of the main menu here you click on that that note selection for a second Jim right there yeah if you wanted to add one okay all right so that looks the same yeah some of that's gonna look the same so some of the things too like if you look at your schedule schedule looks almost just the same but they haven't changed that it may be in the future but right now schedules going to look and work very similar to how it used to. It's going to kind of work very similar, but things like the roll-ups have changed quite a bit. So now if you go into roll-ups, you're going to be able to edit some things in line here. You can see how many names, companies, positions are on each roll-up. You can click into the names right there. Roll-ups are going to slide in from the right-hand side of the screen. And then again, you control what fields are going to show, have your actions right there. We've kind of tried to make every screen look and work the same so once you kind of get your way comfortable on this name screen for example you'll be able to run any list screen and one big difference if you click on the first record it's just going to replace that full screen so you're going to be able to look at that and then you don't have a split screen approach you're going to have your full screen here with whatever you want to see in the workspace so that's going to be a custom piece and then you can use these little arrows that go on either side of the little name tab, there's usually a photo in there or the person's initials, that's going to let you scroll through from record to record as you need to go down through the roll-up list. And now you're going to have, like, I could full screen this if I wanted to kind of full screen it. And then your workspace is a new tab that has been entered to give you the ability to build a custom workspace to show kind of what you want to see on your record straight out of the gate, very basic information. And then you're still going to have a lot of the same tabs. You still have your activities, positions, resumes, attachments, keywords, notes, all of that. Some of the screens are going to look the same like notes because, again, it was designed once PCRM was already in development, so it's going to look very much the same. Activities looks pretty much the same, but a little bit more up-to-date, a little easier to use. You can filter by type or search by username or date range or anything there too. And the something I like that we did under details, that is going to show you every field you have on that candidate and gives you a nice search up top so I can just type in phone instantly isolate only my phone fields or if I type in email now I'm looking at all my only my email fields you're also going to have all of that customizable oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so your workspace is customizable any fields you want to show details is every field you have on that person so that's going to be every field you have and then and there's something we added if If you go to keywords, you can still tag them out of keywords. So I could add, let's see if I wanted to go manufacturing, computer manufacturing, I can apply those. I can even right click, I can tag that. I can add it up to the top of the person's record. So I can add up to three tags right in their main title bar up there, which is kind of a nice piece. And everything works the same. If I go to companies, same thing. Edit in line, I have my same actions. I can go into a specific record. I have a customizable workspace, and I have all of my other details, positions, notes, activities, names, keywords, et cetera. So that's gonna be kind of holding it the same there. Search, kind of nice to use if I'm looking up like Jim Lombardo. I can type in part of first, part of last. As I do, it'll add these little colorful chips, so I can kind of do there. I can add, I can X them out, or I can go to more filters, and then I can go and I can do what we call an all content search which if I go through that's where I have my boolean search I'm going to close out of that I'm going to add that and when I do that search that's going to be similar to the boolean search in the the old version of PCR 8 and it's still going to give you the best match up top it's going to show was found in his attachments his resume I can also click in the resume it'll show it highlighted all that same functionality there so I I have a lot of easy things I can do within that. Some things, like I said, your sequences, your analytics, those screens are virtually unchanged, so those are going to be comfortable. It's going to make it really easy to utilize, really easy to navigate here, sequences, identical. Something different we added was the deals pipeline. So you now have a deals workflow within PC Recruiter. It's essentially the interview pipeline, but it's intended so you could put actually companies in here and track companies you're trying to sell your services to. So you can kind of put them in. You can rename these different steps. And you'll see you can go through, and if I wanted to, one of these, let's see, how do I do it? You can put a note. You can put an attachment. You can kind of set some actions there. So I have some activities I want to do. So maybe I want to call to follow up, email to follow up. Maybe I check off that I did that one. It's going to kind of show you how close you are in the various tasks. You can edit them, and you can give them a different temperature, hot, warm, cold. You can give a confidence level, projected value, projected close date. So this is going to allow you to put all that detail on there about deals that you're working with in PC Recruiter. And then within the next month or two, they're going to have analytics reporting on these deals, so you can do forecasting off of this deal's workflow within the system as well. So that's one thing they added to make it more of a CRM. And then we also, on the roll-up list, have added a feature called simple sequencing. So if you go into a roll-up list, you're now going to have the ability to go right into that roll-up list, and you can build a simple sequence on the fly. It takes a couple minutes. So if I wanted, I could say it's going to be an automatic email. It's going to go to their primary email address. I pick which form letter I want. Then I maybe add a second step. Maybe that will be a phone call. I can put that in there, and I can just save all. and then activate it. So I can, within a minute, build a sequence of several steps and activate it straight away. So I can kind of move people through a sequence without going through our long involved sequencing process, which is very good and thorough, but takes a little bit of setup there to do. And then I can also look at simple sequences. I've got one running here. It's even going to tell me what step they're at. They're at stage one or stage two or wherever they are in my sequence so it's going to give me that functionality there so that's the most else that we've added the parsing and adding is also improved in this version so if I go up here to the add screen we've redesigned an entire ad area kind of where the quick ad used to be in PCRecruiter and this is going to let you drag and drop files in or you can do some cool things like if you go in a name you can add a name you can also say maybe you want to add a company at the same time. So I could add a company here, make it ABC, then I could go to the name, put in John, and I could even go down here and I could link it to a draft record of ABC that I just haven't even created yet. So I can create a whole bunch of records at once. I can parse multiple resumes, attachments, records, create it all at once in here, upload attachments, check for dupes. So I can do a lot of different things within that uploaded that parsing tool. So that's been improved a bit as well. So those are kind of the primary differences. Like I said, a lot of people like just the new look and feel and interface here, a little more configurable, makes better use of the screen there. But if you added it, you're going to have access to the old version and the new version. so you could use it under either. And right now, we're upgrading it. Like I said, 350, that installs the upgrade, creates the new link, and includes four hours training, and then an additional $10 for use for a month, and you've got it. And right now, it shares the same database. Maybe it'll eventually be a spun-off as its own separate product that could be used even by non-recruiters. But right now, it's something you could add on. And if you're using the pipeline within PC Recruiter, you're going to have the same pipeline that you know and use right now. So you're going to have that same exact pipeline, same interface, same functionality. That's going to work within this new database as well. So it's essentially your whole ATS, but now with added CRM functionality and a whole new interface to it. And does it still sort of hold data? So, for example, if I delete somebody, I can go into effectively the same kind of screen, a system screen, and look at the data management and all of the other stuff that typically would sit there if I needed to retrieve something. So you're going to have, this is your MyPCR screen, a little more configurable, a little easier to edit. You can kind of take, drag different things in there, drag widgets around. But this would be where all of your basic MyPCR stuff is going to go. All your recently viewed, today's schedule, info panels, stuff like that. Recently modified. Same ability to inhale from LinkedIn, use RingCentral, calling and texting with clicks and stuff like that? Yep. All that still works because that runs off the basic database. So the capture will work. RingCentral is going to work. All the same integrations are going to work because they're based off that same database. And if there happens to be anything you come across that doesn't work that maybe I don't know of, you still have the PCR9. So if you need to use that specific point, you'd still have that other access point there. So you can use both or whatever best suits your needs. Okay. All right. How many people do you have using the CRM? I'm not sure exactly, but it might be close to 100 different offices using it. I ought to check on that. Okay. Generally pretty good report? Yeah. I haven't heard any. I've heard more good than bad, definitely. And it's also constantly being upgraded and added to, like we're releasing in the next couple of weeks, an auto match feature which will allow it'll add a button to the position record that when you click that button it'll return the 15 best matches of people in your database it'll kind of show it right there let you put them in a pipeline if you want okay so that's going to be able to uh be a nice feature but we're always adding new things too so people are really liking that and then some people still if they want to do something maybe they'll still log in under pcr9 You could still do that. So it's you're not giving it up. You're just adding and getting the new stuff. OK. OK. All right. Good enough. Yeah, I can't really think of any other questions right at the moment. So how long does it take to sort of switch everything up? A few days, a few days. So if you decide you want to do it, let me know and I can email over a new agreement. same amount of users just a new pricing it'll be a new package it'll be PC recruiter premium The AI suite is included in your database now as a trial this summer anyway. But that's included. The PCR is included. Once you sign that, pay the setup a day or two, that'll get the new link created. We'll email it to you and then have a trainer reach out to see if you need some training on it there. So pretty smooth process. Pretty quick, just let me know what you want to do, and I'll circle back maybe end of the week, if I haven't heard, just to circle back if that's okay. Yeah, please do. Okay. Perfect. That'd be great. All right. All right, Kamal. I appreciate you jumping up. What's that? I was going to say, if you have any other questions on it or need me again, just reach out. I'm happy to show you around. Okay. Any other questions. All right. Cool. I appreciate it. Thanks, Jim. Thank you, Doug. You take care. Yep. All right, too. Bye now.",
