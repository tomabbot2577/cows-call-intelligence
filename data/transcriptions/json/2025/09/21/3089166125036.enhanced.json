    "text": " Thank you for calling Name Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. Can I help you? I'm sorry, what is your name? Tyler. Oh, much better. I can hear you now. Tyler, my name is Bonnie, and I am having issues with the drop-down menus when I'm doing an advanced search. They're not there. And I wanted to see if you could help me. Yeah, let me pop in and take a look. Is it just like you're missing some options? I'm missing all I'm missing the drop-down options for predefined fields and custom fields. I don't have any custom fields. Gotcha so usually that just means that you have some search filters on let me pop in and take a look here Let me just find your username. What is your username for PC Recruiter? It's when I sign in, right? Yep. Yeah, BP. So that's easy enough there. And then what type of search are you doing? Like a name? I'm trying to do an advanced candidate search. Yeah, my colleague just called about it, got her six, which should fix it for me too, but it's not. And I can't, and I, you know, logged out and logged back in, but I still don't have any drop. No, I don't. Let me take a look, because I'm logged in as you right now, and it looks like they fixed that selection. Which database are you logged into? The Hire. Okay. let me just let me get out and go into it again just to be sure but yeah i think it's higher yeah it's the higher okay go ahead and log back in for me real quick all right Okay, I'm back in. All right, go to advance under name. Uh-huh. And then go into where it says predefined, go to custom fields. Then click that drop down for custom fields list again. Oh, now they're there. Let me just see. Now let me just see. Let me just go in like a... Huh. Okay, now it's there. That's weird. You must have a magic touch. Sometimes it takes a little bit just for it to run all the full updates on the back end when you transfer settings from one user to another for those filters. Okay, let me try one other thing while I have you on the phone. Yeah, that one's good. Okay. Yeah, it could be, I guess, because that's, yeah, now it's working. Okay, so all right. Well, whatever you did, the magic touch is working now. It's like taking your car to the mechanic sometimes. Quits making the noise as soon as you call somebody. Exactly. Thank you for your help, Tyler. Yep, have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye.",
