    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. It's Jeanette from Job.com. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm doing pretty good. Hey, I got a question that might be a ticket, but we are using Job Robotics, which I guess is a PCR partner, to connect VMSs to PCR. And Nick B sent me the documentation on how to do it, but I just got off a call with him, and they say we need an API key. Do you know anything about that? Yes. So we used to have like a separate account that you would need to sign up for the API. But now, let me find it here. And they didn't read the documentation I sent them yet because I sent them after the call. So they might figure it out. We don't need one by now. But I thought I'd call you. Like the API information? Yeah, they just said, hey, can you contact them and send me the documentation and see if you can get an API key? Yeah, so for our open API now, you don't need a specific key. They can just use, like, API key, like all lowercase, all one word. Okay, great. Okay, I will tell them that then. And you have the answer as always. I really appreciate it. I'm more than happy to help. If you need anything else, just let us know. Thanks. Have a good afternoon. You too. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
