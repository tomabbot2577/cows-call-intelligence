    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. Tyler, happy to help you. Hey, Tyler, is Matt Mueller not there any longer? He is not. Oh, I hate that. I could email him any time for the last several years we've been with you guys, and now we're having an issue and I don't know who to talk with. Well, this is the general support line. I could give you a hand. Okay. Well, the feature that we use every single day in PCR besides parsing is we edit the personal information off of the resumes, off the PDFs, and input our electronic stamp. and I don't know if I was doing something yesterday or what, but all of a sudden I can't edit anything now. And that is not good because I edit about five to ten resumes every single day of the year, and for me not to be able to do that is a huge issue. So like you're hitting the edit button inside of PC Recruiter and nothing's opening up? Yeah, I would hit the little pencil, and then I would go in there and I would erase it, or I would do the upload and upload it to a Word doc or a Word docs, and then I would edit it there, and then I'd save it on my computer, and then I'd send it out to the prospective employer. I'm not able to do that now. It will not edit whatsoever, any resume, whether it's a PDF, a Word, whatever it is, any format it's in, it won't edit anything. So, like, you'll open it and it just doesn't open, though, like when you open it through PC Recruiter? It opens the resume, and then I hit edit, and it will open it again, But I can't erase any information. Okay. I can't change anything. So when you open it in Word, do you see a banner up at the top that says, like, enable editing? Let me open one now. So when I open it at the top, there's nothing except a pencil in the left-hand corner. Like when you click the pencil? Okay, when I click the pencil, it says, let me see. So it's opening up in Word. And it's taking a lot longer to open it these days for some reason. Processing. Okay, and then when it opens, it changes it into a funky format where instead of looking at one page, scrolling down, it's got three pages side by side. And I go in to erase the address, and I can highlight it, but it will not erase. Okay, so it sounds like that's an issue with how the resume came over to you. Because a lot of times resumes, they'll have like frames and headers where you can't edit the text of the header. You can only delete the header. If you right-click on it, like where the address is, does it give you like an edit or delete header option? No. I'm telling you something I did yesterday because I do this every single day and I've tried it with six different resumes and I can't do it with anything there's something in these settings that I accidentally messed up and I don't know what it is because I'm not a programmer yeah I'm trying to take a look because if you can't edit it in word it's definitely a word just setting so I'm just trying to see what you might have done here I'm taking a look at my word now let me pull mine up here So I got to come over. Do you have time to hop on a quick screen share so I can see what you're seeing with those resumes? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Let me start up a video meeting here. What's a good email address for you? Info, I-N-F-O, at toptalentrecruiter.com. All right. Just sent that meeting link on over to you. It's good to hear in just a second. All right. All right. If you see a box asking to connect video and audio, you can just exit out of it. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of that meeting window that says share. It says can't access microphone. You can just . Okay. All right, there it is. And then you'll want to share the entire screen. Well, choose what share with RingCentral, and I'm selecting the tab to share, but it's not doing anything. So you'll want to share the entire screen. Like under entire screen you'll click on which screen you want to share. And then you'll highlight and then you'll click share again in the pop out box. So go ahead and minimize RingCentral. Alright, let's pop into PC Recruiter here. And then go ahead and click the pencil to edit it. And used to when I clicked the pencil, it brought the resume up in the exact same format you see right there on Robert's resume. Watch what it does now. And it does every resume like this. And it never did this kind of format before. Go ahead and click the X over on the right where it says the feedback from Microsoft. Go to file up at the top. Just trying to see... word is in some kind of weird format here go to where it says options down at the very bottom and then display options I'm just making sure mine are the same. Go up to general for me. Those all look the same. Go ahead and exit out of this. Then exit out of Word. Go to your search bar just down at the very bottom. Just type in Word and open up that Word app. Yeah, I want to see what... just do like a blank document. I want to see how it pops up here. Man, that's odd. Is there something to do up here at top? this shouldn't be? No, that should be fine. I'm just trying to, I'm wondering why yours is opening differently. Yeah, because it normally doesn't open up that small. There's something going on with your word here. Go to file in this version of Word. Go to account. Down at the bottom. I wonder if there is a... Just seeing what version of Word you're on. Yeah, this thing is mine. Go ahead and exit out of this for me. Just go ahead and exit out of Word. Inlet your search bar down at the bottom. Start typing in the word add. to add or remove programs we're going to go down to where we find word oh it might be under Microsoft Word so starts with M Go ahead and scroll up a little. I was just under all the apps. Do you leave your computer on overnight by chance? I do. I'm wondering if there's... Have you restarted it since this happened? I have. Okay. I am not sure what Microsoft setting you may have changed. Let me see if I can Google it real quick. Yeah, I'm not seeing anything. Okay. Why would this Microsoft 365 copilot have today's date? That just means it probably ran an update. Okay. Okay. All right, let's go ahead and open up a resume again from PC Recruiter. You want me to pick a different one? Yeah, it doesn't matter. matter which one. OK. Go to where it says compatibility mode. Yep, click into there. Go to where it says view. Go to... Does it give you like a document views? It does give you an edit document there. Go to where it says compatibility mode for me again. I think it's that compatibility mode that's causing an issue. That's probably why it's taken so long to open as well. Yeah. Go into there. Go into that little... I'll let me click on it. Oh, I think I found a way to turn it off. Go to up at the top. Go to options down at the bottom. Go to advanced. Then scroll down in the list over on the right. should be a compatibility options okay Click on all new documents? Yes. Is it okay? Let me just make sure that's what we want to do. Okay. Go ahead and exit out of here. Don't hit okay. Go ahead and exit out of here. We're just going to open Word by itself. Then just do like, yeah, go to file, options. advanced. Then scroll all the way down. Go ahead and hit okay. Should I change it to all documents? No. Okay. Go ahead and exit out of here and then we'll try it again here. If that doesn't work, we might just have to try and run a repair of office. It's still open in compatibility mode. but you can at least make the edits now which is good well yeah can't even I can't even see see that page when would I go to it open don't click the back arrow go to view up at the top It's already in print layout. Go to your Zoom. Click one page. back up to view under you'll see the zoom over on the right go to one click the one page nope nope don't click on that cancel go to view next to the zoom you'll see where it says one page Ah. Okay. And then how do I edit from there? Oh, okay. Just go like that. Yep. So yeah, we got it to where you can start editing now. And now it's back to the one page at a time for you. So I'm going to have to get some of this back to the one page at a time. So I'm going to have to get some glasses now. You can also... Or is there a way to make it bigger? Yeah, go to View again. Click on where it says 100%. Oh, nice. Okay. So is there a way to save this where it opens like that every time? I believe it should hold your settings. Okay. So, yeah, if you... It is slow opening, isn't it? Yeah, being on a screen share doesn't help either. Bogs things down a bit. Okay. Well, you fixed it then. So it looks like, yeah, I don't know if we're updated or something, but you should be good to go now. well thank you for your help do you remember what you did a little bit it was mainly getting it having it open the full page and then changing our view there a little bit yeah well thank you Tyler I'm more than happy to help alright well I appreciate your help thank you so much yep have a great day alright you too bye bye",
