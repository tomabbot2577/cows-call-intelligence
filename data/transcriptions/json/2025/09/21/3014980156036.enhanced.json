    "text": " Thank you for calling me, Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I had a couple of questions, or actually just one question, and was hoping I can get some help with PC Recruiter. Is that something you can take care of? Okay. Absolutely. So in the past, when I'm able to bring up a person's name in the database, In the company website slot, there's usually an email format of what that hospital would look like. It would say first period last at Providence.com. Now it's no longer on the actual person's screen anymore. I have to go physically into the hospital to see what that format looks like. Does that make sense? I think so. Let me see. I'm going to log into your database and take a look. Are you on the Reed Associates Healthcare, Reed Associates Logistics? Okay, healthcare one. It's on healthcare, yeah. And it's under Nick Noblett, N-I-C-N-O-B-L-E-T-T. Okay. I'll log in there. do you know the username that Nick uses oh that's that's me and that is my username the Nick Novelist do you need my password no I won't need the password maybe I spelled it wrong can you spell the last name one more time it's N-I-C N-O-B as in boy L-E-T-T Oh, I forgot to put the two T's. Sorry. Okay. So yeah, now I'm in your database. I'll be able to look at a name record and see your layout, what fields you're seeing. So I'll pull up this first person here, Courtney Yunos. Okay. So you said you were looking for a certain field with the website or email address of the company? So usually, I think it's usually right here where it says like company website. Are you able to see what I'm doing? No, I can't see your screen, but I can kind of follow along in your database. Okay. Here, let me look for a company. Yeah, let's look up like a random company. It doesn't matter which one. How about look up Adventist Health? Oh, that's like a long one. Let me see something with an easier name or something. Okay. Go to, like, for a company, Peace Harbor Medical Center. And these are two different tabs, by the way. Peace Harbor Medical Center. Okay. I've got the company open. Okay. And then you also have that tab for Courtney. Yeah. I can, yeah, I have a second tab recording. Perfect. Okay. So if you're looking at Peace Harbor, where it says email is, see how it says slast at peacehealth.org? Oh, yeah. I see what you mean. So in the past, when I look up like a name and they're in that organization where it says company website that format used to be there so when they're when i'm like putting a person's name it would automatically come up and i'm like okay so that's the format looks like and then i would just type in the email um but now it's gone so i have to like physically go into that company look at that email area to find that format and then go back and do it you know what i mean so i don't know if it was like something that changed in like an update or are we able to put that back So, yeah, what happened was we have gotten rid of the email slash www address field on companies and split them into two separate fields. So if you wanted to, I think it would be best if you changed your company record layout to display those two fields individually. And then we can go over to your name records and look at the email address field for companies. Have that in the name records. So start by opening up your Peace Harbor, any company record. Okay, Peace Harbor. And then go to your action menu at the top right, those icons there, and click the three horizontal lines. And then go to customize, which is a gear icon. Okay. And this is your layout for all your company records. In group two, the third one down, go ahead and click on that email slash www address. and there'll be a drop-down where you can search for website if you just start typing the word website into that drop-down okay and select predefined website and then we'll add if you go to the bottom of that group it says click to set field go ahead and click on that and then search for email just by typing an email and there should be a predefined email address field that you could pop in there okay and then I would if it were me I would take that email address field you just add it in click the three horizontal lines to the right to drag and drop it up higher, maybe next to the website. Yeah. And then finally click the three horizontal lines at the top right, your action menu, to hit save, which is a floppy disk icon. Okay, that's saved. All right, so you can close that browser tab. We've adjusted your company records. You'll have to kind of reopen the company record to refresh the page a bit. it's still going to show you the old one. Okay. And then the last thing I do is change your name record layouts now. So you could go over to Courtney if you have that still open the name record and go to that gear icon in the action menu again. You probably have to click the three horizontal lines. I'm going to customize. And then in, let's see, so I'm on your name records. Yeah. So you have, where is it? Company website is visible under the contact info. That's the right field. It's going to just show you the company website, but it looks like you want the company email address added. Let me see if that is available. Email address. Oh wait, so predefined email address is going to be the one that's with the name record. Is there no like company? Let's do www.emailwebsite. Yeah, I'm going to go with the website. it's just showing company website as an option wonder what yes for some reason it's not letting me see the company email address field on name records yeah which is strange I think they would have wanted to take it out or something because that was so helpful for me yeah let me see there's way around it real real quick here, let me try something else. We could go to group, shortcut group, and go to quick to set. Oops. Let's see, some references, some rollups, associations, attachments, rich notes. No, there's not even a shortcut group that'll do it. Admin info, admin email. Yeah, I'm not seeing. Let me open up a ticket and see if our tech team knows if there's a workaround for that or if maybe we can open up a ticket to get that added back in. But they did make an update to the software that split those two fields. and that's why you're seeing only the website available in the name records now. But we can – I'll open up a ticket and get back to you with adding in the company email as an option. So company email name record layout. What's your best email address to get back to you as soon as I hear from the tech team? it's um n smith so nicole n is nicole smith at read r-e-i-d m-r-i dot com excellent all right yeah i will reach out and get back to you as soon as i hear from the tech team okay thank you for your help i appreciate it no problem have a good one you too bye",
