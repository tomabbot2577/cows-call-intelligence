My daughter's a patient there with Dr. McClave, and I have some paperwork for her EpiPen for school. Is that something that Dr. McClave could fill out? Yes, she could fill it out. When was the last time she had her will? Probably October, last October. Yeah, let me just double check. What's the last name? Lombardo, L-O-M-B-A-R-D-O. Okay, and then first name? Ellen. And birthday? 10-3-17. Okay, let me see. oh yeah okay yeah so we can we can fill it out but she does need a will check because her last check was in uh at the end uh was august 29th of last year okay okay is she scheduled for one um she is not but i can get her schedule really quickly um we can do it what days typically work better for you guys? We don't know because school hasn't started until next week. So in the afternoon probably. How late do you do it? Okay. Usually our last appointment is 4.15. Do you have a 4.15 point or ish? Yeah. Let me see. She seeks Dr. McClain Yeah I got one Monday the 18th at 4.15 that's the first day of school and we're two different schools now so that would be a bad day because i don't know okay what's going on i don't know pickup times or how it's going to go or busing or anything okay um i have wednesday at 4 15 let's try that wednesday is at the 20th what time does school start 845 okay I mean our first appointment is 830 if you don't mind her going a little late if that works a little better for you let's sleep with Wednesday at 415 okay that is good and do you know I'll have you jack but I first want to ask so she has this EpiPen it was not prescribed by dr. McClave but it's been prescribed by her allergist for several years now so So do I need to get this paperwork from Dr. McClave or the allergist or does it matter or do you even know? I'll say typically they go with our original prescriber, but let me double check, okay? Okay. Give me one second. Okay. Here are some simple rules to help protect your family's skin from summertime sun rays. Babies younger than six months old need to be kept out of direct sunlight. Dress in cool, comfortable clothing with a tighter weave to keep sunlight off your skin. And wear a hat to shield your head and neck. Apply sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher and try to limit sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. when UV rays are strongest. Now it's even easier to schedule appointments at Akron Children's. Visit akronchildrens.org slash appointments to see appointment dates, times, and locations for newborn visits, sick visits, well-child visits, and certain specialty visits. Pick the provider and location most convenient for you or schedule with your current provider at akronchildrens.org slash appointments. Okay, usually, yes, the allergist should be the one to fill out the paperwork. Excuse me, because they're the original prescriber. But if you are having a hard time getting the paperwork to them, she'll do it as like a last resort. Okay, I should be able to get it. I would try them next. But I also saw, never mind on that, but I also want to see if my son needs a well check as well. Benjamin Lombard. All right. All right. And what is his birthday? Eight.",
