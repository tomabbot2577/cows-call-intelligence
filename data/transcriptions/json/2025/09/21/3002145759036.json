    "text": " Gus, can you hear me? Hey, how are you? Oh, maybe it was my side. I kept talking to you. I could hear you. You couldn't hear me. I don't know. I kept getting hung up on him, like, I'll try again. And I kept answering it. I was actually writing an email to you. I wasn't sure if it was on my side or yours. I kept unplugging and – I used it just fine like 10 minutes ago. I don't know. So I don't know what happened. Well, I'm trying to get my XML – I'm trying to get my – no worries, no worries. I'm trying to get my PCR jobs on LinkedIn with my XML feed. And the LinkedIn lady said that they made it so that my job should be posting. Everybody's job should be posting. I don't know what I'm – What I need to do. Yeah, let me have you talk with Drew because he's a little bit more of an expert on that one. Hold on one second. Let me see if I can get him for you. Hey, thanks so much. Appreciate it. Oh, no problem. Sorry about the mix up with the phone. You too. Oh, don't worry about it. All right, hold on one second. Thanks. Bye. All right, let me see if he's available. He did not pick up. Are these jobs showing on your job board? They're just not showing on Peace Recruiter? I mean, I'm sorry, on LinkedIn? Yes. Uh-huh. Okay. All right. So then that's not the criteria. Okay. I talked to the sales rep, and she's like, yeah, because it's called job wrapping. And she's like, yeah, we let all the jobs get wrapped now. I'm like, okay. All right. And I can forward the email to you. Hang on. I'm going to actually hear, hold on one second. Because she sent me a hyperlink that doesn't work. And she's like, just follow these instructions. Of course it doesn't fucking work. Yeah, I'm not really sure on that list, David. I'm going to create this ticket to Drew. Needs help with... I think hold on one second let me see if this is him that's me oh I'm just trying to get this all done while I got some down time around the holiday yeah he's in a call um I'm just going to kind of make the ticket a little basic here, and it's going to alert you. It's going to go to stafffinancial.com. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Okay. So Drew's in a phone call right now. Oops, I missed something. Oh, there it goes. Okay. He's in a phone call right now with a customer. But when you get that email, if you reply back with any extra details, and then I'm sure when he's done with the meetings that he's in right now, that he could follow up with you. I did mess, because he just chatted with me. He's like, I'm going to call with, well, the customer. And I said, I'll make a ticket. Hang on. Here it is. I'm just going to reply with what she told me. And then you can see, like, the link she gave me is dead. Right? Yeah, maybe he has some more details. I don't know. You know, here in support, we don't really do the job boards. It's kind of Drew's specialty. Oh, great. If it's possible, whatever, he would be the go-to person for that. He's really, really, really good with it. Awesome. Awesomeness. All right. So do I wait to hear back from him or what happens? Yeah. If you want to add any extra details that you have to that ticket that I created, you can just reply back to that ticket. But when he's available, he'll be following up with you. He's just on a call right now. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. All right. No problem. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye. Thank you.",
