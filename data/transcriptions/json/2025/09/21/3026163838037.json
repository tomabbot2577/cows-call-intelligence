    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Amy Roch with Edna Rice Executive Recruiters. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing pretty good. So I'm calling about our outstanding balance. Okay. The $7,000. Yeah. I'm sure it's super annoying to y'all that all this did not process. Yeah. We're in the middle of all that change. Well, it's the change that we found it. because what we had to do before, the system before didn't really have an auto-pay, so it's like, yeah, you could store a card, it could process it, and that's why it was always so manual if the card ever failed and everything because it was just sending you a receipt as if it processed the card. It was such an archaic way to do it, which is why we needed to upgrade. Right, and I was glad when I saw that you did the upgrade and that we were able to get that all set up. I didn't realize it was like that, though. but um yeah i'm waiting that the receipt was going out and y'all weren't it wasn't actually processing through our cards but we did check and none of them were processed so um edna said to go ahead and just do the whole amount okay the card that you have on i believe the card you have on file ends with 3507 okay let me go over and i'm pretty hold on let me yeah you look in you look on your end and I'll look on my end yeah let me go in there because I got to look up all the detail and everything because what I've been trying to do I mean again there was only a handful of them it's not like it's a ton of clients so that's good it's just unfortunately yours is one of them um good thing is yeah and it was literally like some of them I think for me maybe being new to billing where like if I put it in I didn't hit process card because I thought like it would process something right then so a little bit of error um trying to make sure I wasn't doing anything I was supposed to so that was um but somewhere before I even did it so I don't it is what it is I can't really play you know not productive to point fingers so with you know let's see it's just a casual accident okay here's yours okay yeah so it's 3507 that is the right one that you guys have on file because i have we paid july 11th our monthly okay may 11th july 11th on that call it's making me log back in hold on one second and then customers and uh it was so manual before it's gonna be so much nicer once we get this all people set up because like if like something doesn't work or it's late at least it can remind you okay so auto pay is email too like if yeah a card is declined because again like we have that same issue too where our card you know let's let's say edna's card is you know identity theft or whatever you know we have to change our card half the time we don't remember to change all the different things that are auto pay right when we get automated email because we go oh wait we forgot that one yeah it'll be so much like if the card failed expired like we always have to chase down you guys saw this silly form and then it led to that mistake where somebody forgets to check one check box after putting in all the other details it's so much better so much better it wasn't that fun it was not a fun april making the switch because everyone's like why am i getting an invoice i'm on auto pay and it's like well we have a new system and so okay so yeah it is a 3507 okay okay so and then so that's cool we want to go ahead and pay the full amount this whatever it was okay thousand nine seven thousand nine dollars and ninety ninety six cents okay so give me a moment to generate this because what i am doing just to because there are you know kind of multiple people in here doing things right now um i'm put what i'm doing is i'm putting like a note at the bottom that it was replacing sales receipts that were never processed from a certain date range and i'm actually listing each month in case anyone goes what was this invoice for so i'm being a little detailed on that so i will i will uh and it goes to edna um do you want CC'd on things? No, no, it's fine. She'll forward it to us. Okay. Because I could have used a CC recipient if you want for the account. Actually, if you don't mind doing that, that would be great because sometimes she does forget. Okay. She gets so many emails that are bills. Sometimes I'm like, wait, did you get this one? Did you get this one? So if you put mine on there, that would be great. I mean, she may still send it to me, but I would rather have for sure that I'm getting it. I will put you as a CC recipient for invoices for the account. Okay, so that part is done. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I'll create the invoice, and it should automatically generate. I'll double-check, but I'll detail exactly what months. That way, if you need to do anything for your accounting, you know exactly what it's covering. Awesome. Okay, that'll be great. and that'll just come to her and Cece to me and I'll get that over to accounting. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much for your help, Robin. Thank you. I haven't done the video yet, but I'm going to do it this week because the person that requested it, our recruiter, she's on vacation these next two weeks. So I was like, hey, I'll watch it first and then I'll let you know if you should watch it or if we think we should do a training with everybody. Here's what I will tell you. Here's what I will tell you about that recorded webinar. It was a webinar that I did, so it's really just like doing a training with me. And what people, like when I've sent it to people first, they're like, oh, it was great. And what I really liked about it is I could pause, go back, rewatch it, things like that. And they found that super helpful. So like if you're like, oh, show me that again. Yeah, that's what I was telling Julie you had told me because you had sent it to me before. And I think I would like that because sometimes I get stuck. and I'm like, oh, I can't remember how to do this because I don't do a ton of, like I'm not a recruiter, so I don't do a ton of searches. But when I do, it's like, oh, I don't remember how to do it. But if I have that webinar to refer back to, then I can, you know, I can kind of fast forward to the part that I want and I can go into PCR while you're telling me what to do. And like you said, pause, rewind, figure out what I need. So I think that would be really helpful. And again, like I said, if we still need to do it, now I know what to do to request it. Oh, here's the other thing, too. When I did that webinar, all the participants, I emailed them. It was like a Word document. Yeah, you sent that to me, too. Oh, no, not the Word doc. You sent me the Word online. So when we rewrote the Learning Center, I basically took the majority of that section under Searching off that document. so when I mention things like the table for keyword searching on page six of a document that's on that page called introduction to record searching so I also have in there when I say yeah so that page okay when I keep referring back to page six or the map of the U.S. zip codes I have all of that on that introduction to record searching got it okay so I wanted to highlight Yeah, have that open kind of at the same time watching the webinar. Yeah. That's what I can refer to. And part of that, even that table in that page, some people like to really print it out. So that way they can look and see, oh, wait a minute, when do I use parentheses or when do I use quotes around phrases? So sometimes if they're really struggling, it's helpful for them, too. Because it has, like, what the operator is, when you use it, and then, like, a simple example. Right. When y'all re-indexed and you sent that information, I was like, oh, this is something I should print because this is really nice to know because I didn't know some of those. Yeah. All right. Well, great. Okay. I will get that over to you. No problem. I think. You too. Bye.",
