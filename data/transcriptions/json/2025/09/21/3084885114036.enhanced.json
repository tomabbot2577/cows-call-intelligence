    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Rick Wolf. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing, Rick? I'm not doing the greatest right now. So you and I had worked the other day on companies, employees, and I tried pressing the VCR, and then it makes contact through the portal, and I couldn't find them. And then I think it was you who said that there was no company information in their card and we had to make a dummy company. And that worked at the time, but I can't remember what the dummy company was that we created. Oh, was it that you just had to type one in? Let me see if I had any notes. how detailed I take notes. Let me see. Did I... We did a screen share. Oh boy, I didn't really take good notes on this. just do another session and I'll show you where I am today maybe if that works yeah I'm trying to remember and I don't really do that feature that that wasn't a ticket right it was just like a call-in yeah yeah okay that's pretty bad because I usually take good notes on what we talk about so I can refer back to and apparently I did not on that one well it's okay hey you might pass back to the corporate fathers that when you guys are all busy and it says leave a message and we'll get back to you it's kind of like maybe someday we will it's not like we saved your place in line and then when that's up we'll call you right away if you follow me yeah it kind of just depends because you got people calling in and you got scheduled meetings like trainings and stuff like that. It's not always... No. Let me see. Okay, so you don't have RingCentral, if I remember right, correct? Right, correct. Okay, so I did a Google Meet with you. Do you want me to send it to the at M-E or at willowwolf.com email? Yeah, M-E is fine. Okay. New meeting, start an incident. I kind of remember this, yeah, because it was like some people was working and I remember it. I can't remember what we did. You figured out that some of the people, they didn't have the company filled in on the VCD card or whatever you call it. Okay. So we had to fill that in, but then we created a dummy company because that apparently had happened to someone I didn't know about it. But I can't for the life of me remember what that dummy company was. I wonder if we were just using the name of, you know, like every database has the default company. Maybe we're just typing that name in. This was top 300. Is that correct? right yes what is the name of your default company in that database that means help us top 300 company name of your default oh why is the name of your default company called Gordon Reese. What happened here? I don't know. That's a mistake. Let me see. Did it get changed? On 7-31, admin user changed it. I must have screwed up. On default. But you only have two people in there. Which is very, very strange. Where would you access default company from? So basically what the default company is for is like when you're not picking, like say if you're parsing a resume and you're not picking a company or if people are applying online, it's that fake company record that people would go into. Yeah. It's a company record, but it's got a fake name. how you can easily tell what it is, is if you go to company, and then over at the very far right, there's that office building icon. It says display default company. The problem is with this one. All right. The problem is with the one that's, hold on a second, the one that's coming up, It only has two names, which seems really odd. So let me see. Is there an excessive amount of people at one other company? Do you have PCR job board by any chance? I missed that. What did you say? Do you have the PCR job board by any chance? I don't know what that is. Oh. Is that in the My ECR? Is that where that is? It would be like if you had your job showing on your website. No, I don't have that. Okay. That's just really weird. Okay, let me see. Is there anything in Recycle Bin if it was ever deleted? Let me just do a little. Sure. That default company would be really old. Let's see. When was this record originally created? That might even tell us. They just always put them into activities. Oh, you created one. why don't you have a default company? Okay, I'm going to do a little script here. You might need to add one if there was already one that was supposed to be in there. I might rather bring back where that is. I thought we created a default company the other day, but I couldn't remember whether it was default company was the name. Yeah, and I don't see it deleted. I wonder if it got renamed or... Sorry I'm taking a while here, but... Don't worry. I want to make sure we do it right. You had a lot of people come down with the flu or COVID lately in your area? Mm-mm. Not that I have been hearing too much about it, to be honest. Both my wife and I did. Oh. My cousin said she was sick, but... Oof. That was available... All value default. Okay, let's see. All value... Order by... changed I'm going to see those people. Are they really supposed to be there? Otherwise, we're going to have to make a new default company, I think. I can't see one. And I don't see that was deleted either. Okay. So I'm just going to make a company name called default. Okay. And then we'll go from there. Okay. Check and see if there are companies by default. Yeah. I've already looked. I don't see anything like that. Okay. Default's great then. I can remember that. Nice and easy, right? Yeah. Okay. and then we'll make the other one this Gordon Reese company that you created at the end of July you set it as the default company and it really needs to be either available or client client client okay you gotta show me where you do all the stuff that you're doing right now so I know normally you don't kind of really touch the default Okay, so I sent you an email with a meeting link. Okay. So in my inbox, there's Robin. One call. And then when you join, you don't need to join with the audio or camera. Yeah. It's covered on the phone. So they say allow microphone now, and then they've got a microphone and a camera with a line through them. Do they have to press both of them? That probably means that they're off. And then is it prompting you for a name or, like, ask to join or anything like that? No, there's backgrounds and the fix button in the bottom right, and there's three dots in the top, more options, settings. Boy, I don't know. Why don't you hit join? Ask to join. Ask to join. That's it. Okay. That's what we're looking for. Okay. All right. So at the bottom of your meeting screen, you're going to click on the rectangle with the arrow. Yeah. Share screen. And then make sure you select entire screen, just in case. Yeah. Actually, we don't need to. Okay. Let's go over to your Outlook. Now that we have a default, let's just start with that and see what happens. Okay. So this meeting window, you can just minimize it. You don't want to close it, but you can minimize that one. I don't know what happened to it. It went behind. That's okay. I can see you. Okay, good. So what I did was I pressed, this is from Bremer White and the president of it. And I pressed download vCard. And then I pressed open. And then PCR and synchronize. Okay, so now I'll go to look for Nicole White. Looks like you have her down at the bottom. Oh, yeah. And it's at 310. Okay So Date entered Is that when you just created those? Yeah Hit search Let me just see what happens when you hit search Because it looks like you already had that record open Without doing a search Just hit search Because it prompted you that she was already in there So let's hit search That's the one that looked like it went to Gordon Reese. So I don't know if that... No, so go back to... Yeah, go back to your main... Okay, so here's default. But it looks like you were prompted to... synchronized to an existing contact right I didn't see it really see what you clicked there with her it looks like she was already in delicious delicious go up to name up on your main toolbar I'm a bit right here in the top a very very top so it looks like your menu how are you doing it that way? That's kind of... I don't know. Hold on. Let's do it this way. That's kind of weird because all those other things are at the left. Okay. Okay. So here I am. I do a name search thing. Yeah. Okay. And then Nicole. there's a card over there for her that was like already created before I even talked yeah but that's that's Gordon Reese and that's not the one company we're looking at his basic search on that green heading I'll take you back I think he had a space at the end of her name maybe Take that out. Okay. Yeah. That's the 11th. That's today. So why does it show her at Gordon Reese? What was that page you were on? That page you were on, wasn't it? Can you go back to the page you downloaded her vCard from? Yeah. She's at Bremer. She's the founder. She came from Gordon Reese. Okay. She was a partner there. Maybe it doesn't. Yeah, she was in, and I just think it doesn't change the company. It's probably what's going on there. Right. So shall we try this one more time? Yeah. So, you know, do open. Okay. BCR. Synchronized. So she has no company, so it probably is not going to move company. It's just saying, like, merge it. Okay, so shall we put in Rimmer White there or just let it roll? I don't know if it's going to actually change company at all because that can get a little tricky, like if you already had them where they should be and moving them just because of a V card. I don't know if it's going to do that. Try typing it in and see what happens. Because it probably was just keeping her where she was already in your database. I'm going to guess. Merge PC Recruiter, Outlook, Merge Outlook, Contact a PC Recruiter. Okay, pick that bottom one. Let's see what happens with her existing record. Let's go back over to your database. you want to go back over to your main window and your other window because you're kind of like framed in you're kind of hitting like a shortcut over at the left but like minimize the screen minimize the screen minimize that one that one where is your other main pcr screen that you were logged in as that has like the full toolbar at the top. Now, I think it was probably maybe even Chrome because that's not giving you all the PCR. Well, yeah, it kind of was. All right, go back to where you were. I saw the toolbar this time. I wasn't seeing it before. Okay, go to name on the main toolbar. It looks like the card thing doesn't change her company. You'd actually have to go in and change her company. Yeah. What it normally does is it creates a new contact. I forget whether it asked me if I want to make a new contact or what, but that's what it normally does. yeah but so she was already in it just doesn't change her company you would actually have to create the company first and then use change company and move her over okay let's look at this and look at the company that she Bremmer white is actually in your database look I see it over in your recently viewed yeah okay names so she's just not in that company just doesn't move her over so what we're going to have to do with her with hers is go back to name at the very top yep I kind of have the bottom section pushed up too much. So it's got like green and then light blue. I'm going to have to, there you go. Okay. Let's open up her record. So she's actually in your recently viewed over at the right. Viewing here? Yeah. Nicole White. There she is. so if you click that it opens up her record so what we have to do is we have to change her and move her over to the other company so you click on that office building icon start typing BREM and then hit search and then which one does she go into okay hit change and then hit save. Okay, so now she's in the right company at least. So she was in your database, but she's already in a different company and that tool is not going to change her company. Okay. It didn't used to do that though. That's what gets me going is that it would leave the old one and just make a new one. That could be maybe it was like a different email address and it was like a different person that thinks it's possibly a different person. That could be going on as well. Okay, so now I want to look at the default company. So let's see what happens when we say that. Okay, so there it is. so this is one I just had to create because I couldn't find one other than that other one but it wasn't really a default but it's now the default default company correct yeah that was the Gordon Reese that was a real company the default company record that we said is the default there should only be one in your database it's just a company record it with a fake name. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, let me try this and see how I do. Okay. Hopefully we got you going there. Thank you very much as usual. I appreciate everything you do. Okay. Have a nice evening. You're in overtime now, aren't you? Yeah, I got a lot to do today. there is a lot you're welcome bye",
