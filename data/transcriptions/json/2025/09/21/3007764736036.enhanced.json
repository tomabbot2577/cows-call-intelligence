    "text": " Hi, you've reached Christina Stone, Vice President Recruiting Solutions at Fusion Recruiters. I'm sorry I can't take your call at this time. I'm either on another call or away from my desk, but please leave your name, number, and a brief message, and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks so much. I hope you have a great day. Hey, Christina. It's Jim Lombardo, PC Recruiter. I got your email here. I was cc'd on it to Robin. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and adjust the tickets so we will not make a determination. It will be a data return for the Fusion Recruiters LLC database. And then after you get that data return, pop me a quick email and let me know when you want to drop down to two users officially and I can put in a ticket to make that happen as well. My direct is 440-856-0314 if you have any questions. And I will get things moving here. Thanks. Bye bye.",
