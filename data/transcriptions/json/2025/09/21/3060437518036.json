    "text": " Thank you for calling NCMU. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Scott Schreuer again. How are you doing? Good. How are you, Scott? Good. A couple questions. So I've got a new employee starting next week, and I saw that an email was sent that she was invited to take the course with PCR. It looks like there's a bunch of videos and whatnot here that she'll be watching, which is great. do you know how long the from start to finish the amount of time it is to get through all the videos so they're kind it's really hard to say because they're kind of self-paced because you can just like watch the videos and like click through the yeah slides pretty quickly so yeah I would say generally maybe like a day you could get through most of them Yeah, okay, that's what I thought. I know it's pretty extensive, which is fine. Cool. Because I know that previously we had new employees, and maybe you weren't familiar with this, but through MRI, we have something called the path, and all the videos are there. it looks so I think it's the it's the I think it's like the same thing it looks like PCR I think it's kind of like it looks like I just got to go through it, it looks like it's the same stuff but okay, no big deal there I'll go through now So I need to add the extension. I don't think the – let me see if the manage – let me see if it's on extensions. Oh, there it is. Perfect. Never mind. all right cool awesome all set i appreciate your help yep not a problem have a good one bye",
