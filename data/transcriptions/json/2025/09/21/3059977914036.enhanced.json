    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. Can I help you? Yes. Good morning. This is Mike Lee from Brightleaf Group. We've been customers of yours for many, many years. But I need some help. We have, I think, for me, mistakenly downloaded something called Capture that works between PC Recruiter and LinkedIn. Is that right? So it works on a number of sites, not just LinkedIn, but it allows you to source the information from LinkedIn pages. All right. What I need to know is how do I remove it? So if you go up to your extensions in your browser, you'll see like a little puzzle piece icon. Browser. My browser. I'm NPC recruiter. Is that what you're saying? No, the browser would be like Chrome or Edge. Oh, okay. Okay. Hold on. Okay. All right. I've opened Google. All right. So in the top right-hand corner of Google, you'll see the three little dots in the top right-hand corner. Yep. I'll click on it. You'll go to Extensions in that list. Search to Google. I see it. Okay. Manage Extensions? Yep. Okay. Okay, Adobe Acrobat, better search, Google, stay free, don't see anything about PC Recruiter. It would be called PCR capture. well acrobat better search email finder google and grammarly stay free um i don't see any any well it should i search extensions would that work you can try um okay And it's PCR capture? Is that what it's called? Yep, PCR space capture. Space capture. It says no search results found. Okay, then that means you don't have it installed on Chrome. Okay. Oh, I see. Okay. Where else would I have it installed, I guess we'd have to ask, right? Yeah, do you normally use another browser other than Chrome? No, I don't think so. What other browsers would there be? Do you use Edge at all? No, never heard of that. Okay, that's like Microsoft's version. Ah, well, everything in here is Microsoft this and Microsoft that. Well, let's try it. Edge, E-D-G-E? Yep. Edge of tomorrow. I guess I better put Microsoft Edge. And I see. Yeah, it would be Microsoft Edge. okay Microsoft Edge got that download Microsoft Edge free Microsoft Excel so you would get the programs that are already on your computer not do like a Google yeah I don't yeah don't want to download it if you're not seeing it as an extension on your computer or a browser that's downloaded on your computer you probably don't have it there but that's the only place capture would be is in a browser. All right. How else can I find it? I really, some of my guys like it, but I don't. It's in my way. I don't use it. So go ahead and open up LinkedIn. Okay. Okay, LinkedIn is opening. And then go to just like any profile in LinkedIn. Well, across the top where it has maps, it has PC. Oh, that's just the open PC recruiter interface. Yeah, that's that one. Yeah, that's just your bookmarks. Yeah, yeah. Okay. I got to go back to LinkedIn. Okay. come on there okay i'm sorry i instead of listening i talked so now what did you say i'm back in linkedin then go to a profile a profile i don't know what you mean by that like someone's linkedin profile like click on profile views okay oh well my own okay i'll go of my own okay and then do you see a PCR capture pop up enhance cover public it would be on the right hand side you'd see like a click to add or click to update my inside language profile connect with no no are you file settings add profile section that no no go to like some one that your connection with and click on their name okay like you're viewing their information on LinkedIn yep okay I've done that I've got one of my guys up to add or click to update over on the right I I see add and with three little dots no that's not it it would be a little square box with the PCR logo in the middle of it that says click to add me for business learning on bookmarks. I don't click. No, I don't see it. Okay, so that means you don't have the capture tool installed. Ah, okay. Well, I know which one of my guys does. All right, I'll go to him. Jim Sides, Jr. He loves it. Okay. so capture is like a per computer thing not like a you'll see capture because he has it okay now i'm in i'm in his uh promoted um profile all right now i've got him up now what am i looking for for what we needed to with that click to add. What that means is you don't have capture installed. If he has capture installed, he'll see it on his computer, but you won't see it if he has it installed. Okay. Well, when I open PC Recruiter and I go to login page, it says what's down below. It says, what's new? PCR capture update. This can capture browser available in PCR. The other thing that happens if I open my emails. Let's see, close it and then open it. and hmm oh are you talking about like the advertisement pop up yes yeah you can't get rid of that within the Outlook portal Outlook okay but when I open oh shit Yeah, if you're opening PCRecruiter and seeing that, you can check the box that says, do not show, and then skip. All right, well, that's... Go away for a little bit, but anytime we do an update to the system, that's going to come back. There's no getting rid of that. Okay, well, that's not the problem. That just tells me that I have it. Well, no, that's not telling you that you have PCR capture. That's just our announcements pop up. Okay. Okay, so everybody gets that is what you're saying. Yes. Okay. But here's what I'm talking about. Now, when I open Outlook, okay, now I get, as soon as I open it, I get my list of emails that I've received on the left-hand side, But the whole right-hand side of my Outlook says at the very top in small letters, PC Recruiter Portal. That connects Outlook to PC Recruiter, and I don't understand it. And there's two little arrows, and you have to click on those, and it takes me to the reading pane. but I never got this until this PC Recruiter portal and it's part of that capture, right? No, it's completely different. Ah, so it's a different thing that I've added from PC Recruiter. Yes. All right, well, why don't we start by getting rid of that? All right. So that one you would just have to go down into your taskbar down at the very bottom of your screen. Yeah. Go to type in the word add or type in the word remove. And you'll see a system setting that says add or remove programs. Down at the bottom. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Under system. Okay. Settings. Did you say settings? Nope. It'll be add or remove programs. Okay. Spotify, Microsoft, LinkedIn. Shipping tool movies. Let me see. Microsoft Edge. Okay. Biden. I don't see add or remove. This is under. You have to type into that quick search bar. Oh, okay. Add or remove programs. Okay, and hit enter. Okay, it's opening something. Okay, Adobe Acrobat. Duck, duck, go. Sorry, Microsoft, Microsoft, Microsoft. What am I looking for, PCR? No, are you in the add or remove program section? Yeah, there's a whole list of them, yeah. So you'll scroll down in that list. It's in alphabetical order. You'll find one that says PCR portal or PCR portal. Power up in Microsoft. hmm they're not in alphabetical order but Microsoft I'm still going I got a lot of stuff in here I guess I could clean some of this out couldn't I PC recruiter portal okay and then you can click the three dots at the very end of that box and on install this tab is related and info will be uninstalled. Okay. Do you want to allow this app from an unknown? Yes. Okay. So it's uninstalling it. Now explain to me what I just uninstalled. I don't use it, but explain to me what it was. So the PC Recruiter portal allows you to connect your Outlook with PC Recruiter. so that oh okay okay so that that's that's that's what i wanted to do okay okay well let's see you've helped me i i appreciate your patience more than happy to help i just so you understand and my wife always gets angry when i tell tell you guys this but i'm 79 years old. So I was in my 40s before personal computers even came around. And here's a question for you. Do you know who sold the first PC, personal computer? I do not. Radio Shack. They came out with the first personal recruiter. It was a partnership with Texas Instruments. and the first personal computer that you could buy and take home was from Radio Shack. Now there you learn something. See, I learned a lot this morning and you learned something. Okay, well, thanks for your help. Not a problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye.",
