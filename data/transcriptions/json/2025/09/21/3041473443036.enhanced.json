    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hey, Mackenzie. I'm Connie Rose. I'm on the system under Connected Services, and I'm using the roll-up function. Okay. I want to try to track how many calls a day, because when you get calling and calling and calling inside your database, by the end of the day, you're a little punchy, you know? and I went into I did some research and I went into roll ups and I went into activities but I can't see when I look over at results it just shows how many is in my roll up I can't really find exactly how many I called on a particular date is that available? I mean I know the admin can see it but I want to be able to see it because I have a goal and I don't want to have to count one, two, three, you know, down the list, because I make, I'm coming up to speed, and I'm making a lot of calls now, so I don't really want to have to hunt it down, you know. Sure, give me one second. Let me get to where you're at here. I can look, and I can see a lot of the ones I called today, but then at the very top, I see Grace Reagan, and I don't think I called her today. I know I called her, but it was Monday or something. What is the username that you log in as? I don't know. Zerose or something like that? It is. Maybe just where's PCR? You're on here somewhere. Username is Connie. Okay. Password is, you need the password? You don't have to tell me that. I didn't figure, but I don't care. It's just work. You got all the information anyhow. Yeah, we log in. There's a way to track who logs in, and I log in with my password as a main sequence employee. So you could actually track me logging into your database with that. So I don't log in with your username and password. I log in with your username but my password. It's like an over. Yeah. Are you there? Hello? Hello? I lost you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Sorry. Yeah, I'm here. I lost you for a minute. Hello? Yeah, I'm here. Oh, my gosh. One second. I really despise RingCentral's controls for this. One second. Because it's connected to RingCentral, and I came over here, and I'm like, okay. Let me just pause. Okay. I'm so sorry. Because you can look for something forever, and it's late at night. I can hear you now, and you can hear me now again. Sorry. Right. Yeah. All right. Sorry, I always get mixed up. The audio settings are so frustrating in the RingCentral app. Tell me about it. We had trouble today. I noticed that RingCentral wouldn't dial out the first time. Like, it would dial, but I wouldn't get a voicemail or I wouldn't get a person. I'm like, hello, hello. And it did that two, three times today. And then I get a message from my admin, the administrator on the account, and he goes, this guy with this number you called him but somehow when he called back he got me and i left my mobile number for ring central i mean i left that number i don't know about that for me it's the cord on my microphone like i i'll hit it and it'll short and then it just completely loses the microphone and then i have to re-establish it but the screen is just annoying right three different there's a there's a speaker and microphone combination setting but then there's a microphone setting and a speaker setting like we don't need all three of those you could just have two one for microphone one for speaker keep it there and i changed the combo setting and like my microphone is not a speaker my microphone can't be a speaker it's a microphone so i select that and then i can't hear you and then i you know it's just so it's just frustrating Sorry about that. Anyway, so I'm logged in as you. I'm on a roll-up, and I want to ask this again. So you're trying to find out how many people you've called today? Today. That's your goal? That's it. Yeah, I mean, I see the different options. Call, but we don't want all because I've been calling a lot since I got here. Miss, I don't want that. And it says edit. Miss outgoing or incoming. But if I do that, but, you know, it looks like it's going to tally everything I've done from day one, and I don't really want that. How do you, what clicks do you take inside PCR to see that, like that you're talking about now? I want to see like what you're doing and adjust it. Well, in PCR, I have a roll up. And I just go to the person's name and open up the profile and I just go to their cell phone and dial it straight from the PCR platform. And it rings the ring, you know, dials out the ring central. but I don't see anywhere I can track my daily activity. I mean, it may not matter to some people, but it matters to me. That may not be a functionality that I make it say to be, oh, well. Would you want to see like every name that you have an activity for today? Is that something that would, like no matter what activity it was? no matter what activity it was. I mean, I know what the activity is because I'm choosing the activity. So I just want to know the number of people I've called, whether I had to leave a message, doesn't really matter. It's an action, you know. I just want to make certain. Go ahead. I believe we have this already. Where would I find it? So, yeah, so click on My PCR. It's in the top left. It's on the main toolbar next to company and name. Okay. And then on the MyPCR screen, there's like a today, which is in the bottom frame. There's a today like little dashboard on the left. It'll say today's schedule, web candidates, new names, name activities, company activities. If you click on name activities, it'll show you all the activities for today. And currently today you have 205. You've been very busy today. Okay. I didn't call 205 people. Well, that's just all the activities. Like that includes add profile, that includes save name, which is just making a change to a name. Interviews. Yeah, so every activity. That'll get you all the activities. So that's just built into the MyPCR screen. If you wanted a quick way to just basically find all the activities that you did today. Right. Perhaps make like a more specific query. Can I filter the activity? You do have activity search at the top as well. If you click the actual activities action on the main toolbar, that'll pull up the activity search, which is different from a name search. You could search out specific activities. like if you wanted to just see all the outbound calls, you can search today's date, and then in the activity type field, you just type in outbound, and then if you search that, today you have 188 outbounds. I have outbound what, phone calls? I'm looking for phone calls. I'm not looking for all the activity. I see the start date, August 5th, 2025. Records per page is showing 25. order date last name you but it's still not is when I drop it is the filters section minimized is there like a blue bar underneath all that that says filters on the left side and you know it should expand down more filter types and under that you'll see activity type as a field like the third one in the top row and you can out the activity for an outbound call is just the word outbound so you could perhaps type in outbound or if you wanted to say search inbound it's just inbound or you could even do both of them separated by a comma and you can get both all like all your inbound and outbound calls looking under select an activity type i see recruiting sales marketplace candidates profiles system activities, touch plane, research, admin, old code, and system generated activity. I don't see out there. Let me look over here. Yeah, if you use the picker, you got to kind of click through them to find them. Those are all minimized. I don't know, let me find out, scroll through it. It has excluded activity types. No, in the select an activity type window, if you expand the system activities little folder there. In there, there's outbound and inbound. Let me type that. You can type into the field as well. You can type the word outbound. It's not giving me what I want. It gives me system when I expand it. There's two systems. One at the very bottom of the list is not the one you want. You want to go to the one in the middle of the list and expand it. There's a little sideways arrow. If you click that down and scroll down a bit. Okay, hang on just a second. I don't think I'm in the right place. I'm in filters, company, roll-up, position, user, first name, last name, activity type, first name, and then excluded activity types. Am I in the right place? Yeah. I don't think so. You don't need exclude activity types. in the activity type field. It's to the left of that. You can either just type into the field or click the picker box. Which picker box did I pick to get to outbound? Because I don't see it here. I mean, I see the picker errors where it drops. Research, touch, system activities. Let's drop that and see what it shows. Yeah, under system activities, if you scroll down a bit, they're in I think alphabetical order so inbound and outbound are actually right next to each other call received an outbound call okay outbound okay take the outbound and so that's sitting in activity type and you could have just typed the word outbound in there or you could perhaps put both you can like you can say outbound comma inbound and you'll find all of those as well Okay, so outbound calls. Yeah. I don't see that number anymore. Where is that number? Once you select it, you have to run the search. You have to, at the top right corner, there's a search action. And if, you know, your date set and your activity type is set, if you search that, at the top right of the results that come up, it says how many results there are. And currently today, just for Outbound, you have, oh wait, this is all usernames. You might want to search by your username as well, sorry, which is Connie, so that you'd have to go back to the username field and enter in Connie. Okay, I don't know how to get back to the. In the top left, after you've run a search, if you click Refine Search, it will go back, basically, and it'll keep all your. Hang on, let me go to search. I don't even see search. I see company name, position, interview, where to search at. Okay, company name, position, interview is like what record type you're searching. It's under refined search. Right, click on the word refined search. And that'll bring you back to your search query. It'll put you back at the filter screen where you can choose different things to filter by. It'll keep everything you had there. So you want to search username Connie and then activity type, like whatever activity you're trying to search for. So I should type my name in the text search box? I've got a username, but where do I put Connie? There's a username field in the filters area right next to activity type. I'm totally lost. I'm in, let me tell you where I'm at, activities slash search para. Yeah. I'm under names where I have start date, end date, records per page, order by username. I click that. Where do I type in my name? I'm here. In the username field, you can just type in Connie. I don't have a username field. I have a little circle I click. Order by, date entered, last name, username, company. Sorry, sorry. That's the order by. That's how the results will be ordered. If you go to the username field under filters, like below that, you can type in Connie. Connie. Okay. Below that. Okay, below that I have filters, and it has today's schedule, new names, company activities, web candidates, name activities. Where do I go from here? I'm in the wrong screen, but I don't know how to get to the right screen. I'm very new to this software. So where do I go? I'll let you catch up to me. Hello, are you there? Yeah, I'm there. I just, I wasn't seeing what you're seeing. Okay, so I think we have to just start over. Let's start over. Let's start over because I'm in the wrong. All right, so let's just start over. I'm going to click activities on the very top main toolbar. Okay. That's going to refresh it. All right. and then it defaults to having the name tab underlined. I'm going to refresh because it's not reloading. Let me refresh. Go back. Okay, let's go to activities. Okay, I'm in the activities page again. I'm still sitting here under name. It says company name, position, interview, you know, the other ones that go past. Start date, end date, records per page. Yeah, name is underlined. That's good. Under search params, the start date and end date default to today's date, which is good because that's what you want. You don't have to touch anything else under search params. You want to go under filters below that. If that's not expanded, you could expand it. And then there's... It looks expanded because I click on it and it's not expanding. I mean below it, the only thing I see is RingCentral status connected today and then standard stat. Oh, okay. Custom stat. Yeah, that's a different – that's the bottom frame. There's like two frames in PCR where it's the top and bottom and you skipped all the way to the bottom. Okay. Filters should be – I'm wearing a... to be I'm in filters I'm in filters now I had to click that little um it drives me crazy this flip screen but I kind of got used to it doing roll-ups so I'm in the filters company roll-up list position ID username last name all of that there we go okay so yeah the username field you could just type in Connie they go to my username okay and then an activity type the field right to the right of username. You can type in inbound or outbound or perhaps both separated by a comma. And then you can hit the search action in the top right and that will give you the search of all the activities for that. Okay, I just typed in outbound. I just typed in outbound. And what was the next thing after I typed in outbound that you said? Let's just try outbound. And so after you set your filters, like say this is what we want to run, in the top right, there's a little magnifying glass action icon. You can click on that, and that will search the database for whatever filters you had set. And right now it says 50 results. It looks like there are 50 outbound activities today made by the username Connie. Oh, that's good. That's more than I thought. Yeah, that's very good. Now you're very busy. Yeah, and then calls were coming back in. And people don't want to shut up, right, when you get involved. You want to get your information. I rolled over a book of business from a company that I had for 22 years. And some of the data's clean, some of it isn't. You know how that goes. You're in this business. You know how that goes. And so between me and two offshore people, we're trying to clean the data up. But at the same time, I was hired to recruit. So I want to recruit and I want to try placement. So I'm spending part of my day, most days, trying to get clients brought over, but also trying to get candidates cleaned up and some of them brought over, right? Because if you do enough activity, eventually you're going to get a job order. I mean, it's going to happen. I mean, there's no way it wouldn't happen if you're putting in the time and you're making the calls and you're sending the text and, you know, you're following up with people. So it's just, you know, I want to maintain a certain amount of calls per day, but my challenge is maintaining, because I'd like to do 50 a day, but I can't do 50 a day and engage with clients too. It's kind of like a juggling act. So what I'm going to have to do is one day, spend one day just pounding it out with 50 calls, right, because calls are coming back in. She's real busy. I cut lunch short so I could get through the rest of my list that I wanted to get to today. And then the next day, focus on clients. Then the next day, bounce back to inbound calls. I'm going to run that past the owner because there's no way to do both. You just can't do it. There's no way. I'm in a similar boat. I'm supposed to be on the phone, but I'm also the database administrator, so it's kind of hard to do both. Right. So let me ask you a question. If I were to do outbound, comma, inbound, would it separate them or would it put all outbound and all inbound together? It would pull them back and it would order them based on the order by selection that you selected. Those four little circles that you – unfortunately, there's only four ways to order activities because of how complex the search is. So there's only date entered, last name, username, and company name. So I think it would just order them by, you know, whatever option you list right there. So it would probably be date entered is the most common one. So you'd probably see a missing chronological order that you made them in. Yeah. So I hate to hang up, but my boss is calling me, so I want to catch his call. I'm going to call back probably tomorrow and ask him more questions about this, but I want to talk to him right now. But thank you so much. You helped me a tremendous amount. Have a wonderful evening. Thanks. Thank you. No problem. Have a good day. All right. Bye.",
