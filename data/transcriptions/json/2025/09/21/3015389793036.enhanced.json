    "text": " Thank you, Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Dave Stade with Virtus Recruiting. How's it going? Good. I'm hoping you can help me out. I spoke to somebody yesterday who was trying to troubleshoot an issue I was having with Outlook integration, and we didn't get it resolved, and they were going to work on it in the backdrop. I don't know if that's been resolved, but I have another question maybe as a workaround. I just wanted to see if you could help me. Sure. I'll try to look up if there's like a ticket open. Let's see. It would have been from around yesterday this time. Okay. and real quickly that the general issue I'm having is that when I click the LinkedIn button when I'm using Outlook in the Outlook view for PC recruiter it defaults to like a Microsoft Edge browser but like a version like a thin version that doesn't even give me the ability to pull up toolbars. So I'm not able to like use the PC recruiter extension if I wanted to add somebody or update a record from there. My default browser is Chrome. So we've kind of played with a bunch of those settings and didn't seem to get it to trip and loading Chrome from Outlook, but it's kind of a workflow blockage if I can't at least get the PC recruiter extension, you know, working in it. yeah that makes sense yeah I found the ticket here were you working with Robin yep that's not familiar okay yeah she is still researching that issue she's talking to our development team just because anything that they know about I yeah I haven't heard of a solution or heard that issue before I would offer a solution but the yeah first thing I would check is probably what you guys already did like you said with your default browser it might be just that Microsoft Outlook is a Microsoft product and so they're gonna push the edge connection for some reason I don't I don't know that's what I'm assuming is happening but we couldn't I mean we played with all kinds of default settings and you don't seem to get anything to work so but I can't even the one that it pulls up is like it's edge but it doesn't even allow you to edge Edge light, yeah. Yeah, I can't add toolbars. I can't access extensions. I don't even know where they would be. Gotcha. When you are in just like a regular email and there's a link in there, does that function the same way, opening like an email in Outlook with a link? I didn't try it in an email. I could try just like emailing you something right now, see if it will put a link in there. I mean generally like if I click a hyperlink generally in an email it goes yeah default Chrome browser effects okay yeah okay and then so there's two places in PCR to click on the LinkedIn link are you doing that in either one of these yeah if I do it on the side bar on the left or the LinkedIn field okay field with the button actually what goes yeah huh all right yeah I will drop a note to Robin let you know let her know that you called just see if she has any updates okay I think she's getting in in about 15 minutes this morning so she might maybe have some news for you but okay yeah she'll she'll keep you in the loop and I'll just make sure that she knows you called all right thanks appreciate it thanks",
