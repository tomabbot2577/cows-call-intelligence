    "text": "Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Ryan with KVAS. How are you today? How's it going? Oh, that's good. Hey, I've got a user in our construction database that is trying to send email campaigns, and it says that it completed, but then it said none of the emails sent, but I can't get any error message to pop up tell me what the issue is. I'm hoping you can give me more info. Sure. What's the username? Good thing. Good question. Hold on. It's S. Bautista, I believe. Yes, S. Bautista. Let's see. I might not be spelling that right here. B-A-U-T-I-S-T-A. Okay. I checked both the aliases and it says they're connecting, but, you know, who knows. One thing to look at is if they were clicking on Use Existing Campaign rather than creating a new campaign, if they're trying to send to the same people twice, it won't do it for Use Existing Campaign, if that makes sense. You just have to create a new one. if you're going to try to send a campaign to the same type of people or same list of people you would want to just make a new campaign most of the time that's why I would say not sent but yeah let me double check these again yeah oh um it is missing a reply to address on one of the aliases So I think that might contribute to some kind of issue there. Let's see. Yeah, so if you go to system, email setup, and then email alias list, the first alias on the left is the thing it replied to. Is that what it was sending from or trying to send from? not the SendGrid version are you able to tell that oh um I would be able to tell that just because it's a the exact same email address um okay but yeah it's it's it could be that they sent through SendGrid and then the reply to wouldn't have mattered um because they use the alternate alias but the at least in the background tasks I'm going to take a look Yeah, the not sent we usually see because they tried to send the same campaign to the same people with use existing campaign. Okay. So I mean I just first glance they look like a different list. Are they not and I'm just missing something? I am not sure. Let me see. Maybe these. It could be that they sent the campaign previously as well, like a while ago to that list. I would just have them try it again with Create New Campaign and see if they have the same issue. That's usually what it is. But if they still have the same issue after hitting create new campaign, then we can take a look a little bit further. But usually that's what causes the not sent. Okay. All right. I'll have her try that and we'll let you know. All right. Awesome. Thanks so much. Okay. Thanks.",

I help you?\n\n4\n00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,160\nHey, Garrett.\n\n5\n00:00:06,281 --> 00:00:07,140\nThis is Ryan with KVAS.\n\n6\n00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,880\nHow are you today?\n\n7\n00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:09,839\nHow's it going?\n\n8\n00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,053\nOh, that's good.\n\n9\n00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,120\nHey,\n\n10\n00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:13,962\nI've got a user in our construction database that is trying to send email\n\n11\n00:00:13,982 --> 00:00:15,043\ncampaigns, and it says that it completed,\n\n12\n00:00:15,063 --> 00:00:17,886\nbut then it said none of the emails sent,\n\n13\n00:00:17,946 --> 00:00:24,313\nbut I can't get any error message to pop up tell me what the issue is.\n\n14\n00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,293\nI'm hoping you can give me more info.\n\n15\n00:00:34,355 --> 00:00:34,557\nSure.\n\n16\n00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,608\nWhat's the username?\n\n17\n00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,264\nGood thing.\n\n18\n00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:40,355\nGood question.\n\n19\n00:00:40,824 --> 00:00:41,158\nHold on.\n\n20\n00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:41,463\nIt's S.\n\n21\n00:00:43,663 --> 00:00:44,508\nBautista, I believe.\n\n22\n00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,442\nYes, S.\n\n23\n00:00:48,308 --> 00:00:48,618\nBautista.\n\n24\n00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,767\nLet's see.\n\n25\n00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,898\nI might not be spelling that right here.\n\n26\n00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:00,665\nB-A-U-T-I-S-T-A.\n\n27\n00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:04,275\nOkay.\n\n28\n00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,612\nI checked both the aliases and it says they're connecting, but, you know, who knows.\n\n29\n00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,144\nOne thing to look at is if they were clicking on Use Existing Campaign rather than\n\n30\n00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:23,865\ncreating a new campaign,\n\n31\n00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:26,087\nif they're trying to send to the same people twice,\n\n32\n00:01:26,107 --> 00:01:28,229\nit won't do it for Use Existing Campaign,\n\n33\n00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:29,290\nif that makes sense.\n\n34\n00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,031\nYou just have to create a new one.\n\n35\n00:01:44,695 --> 00:01:50,173\nif you're going to try to send a campaign to the same type of people or same list\n\n36\n00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:57,600\nof people you would want to just make a new campaign most of the time that's why I\n\n37\n00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:02,140\nwould say not sent but yeah let me double check these again yeah oh um it is\n\n38\n00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:07,346\nmissing a reply to address on one of the aliases So I think that might contribute\n\n39\n00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,580\nto some kind of issue there.\n\n40\n00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,160\nLet's see.\n\n41\n00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,504\nYeah,\n\n42\n00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:18,407\nso if you go to system,\n\n43\n00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:19,375\nemail setup,\n\n44\n00:02:19,375 --> 00:02:21,794\nand then email alias list,\n\n45\n00:02:21,794 --> 00:02:27,600\nthe first alias on the left is the thing it replied to.\n\n46\n00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,660\nIs that what it was sending from or trying to send from?\n\n47\n00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,002\nnot the SendGrid version are you able to tell that oh um I would be able to tell\n\n48\n00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:43,992\nthat just because it's a the exact same email address um okay but yeah it's it's it\n\n49\n00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:48,925\ncould be that they sent through SendGrid and then the reply to wouldn't have\n\n50\n00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:54,210\nmattered um because they use the alternate alias but the at least in the background\n\n51\n00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,029\ntasks I'm going to take a look Yeah,\n\n52\n00:02:57,029 --> 00:03:02,666\nthe not sent we usually see because they tried to send the same campaign to the\n\n53\n00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,780\nsame people with use existing campaign.\n\n54\n00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,880\nOkay.\n\n55\n00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,840\nSo I mean I just first glance they look like a different list.\n\n56\n00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,980\nAre they not and I'm just missing something?\n\n57\n00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,980\nI am not sure.\n\n58\n00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,360\nLet me see.\n\n59\n00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,260\nMaybe these.\n\n60\n00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,412\nIt could be that they sent the campaign previously as well,\n\n61\n00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:44,900\nlike a while ago to that list.\n\n62\n00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,527\nI would just have them try it again with Create New Campaign and see if they have\n\n63\n00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:51,520\nthe same issue.\n\n64\n00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,460\nThat's usually what it is.\n\n65\n00:03:59,309 --> 00:04:02,587\nBut if they still have the same issue after hitting create new campaign,\n\n66\n00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:05,109\nthen we can take a look a little bit further.\n\n67\n00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:11,286\nBut usually that's what causes the not sent.\n\n68\n00:04:11,034 --> 00:04:11,286\nOkay.\n\n69\n00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:11,286\nAll right.\n\n70\n00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:11,286\nI'll have her try that and we'll let you know.\n\n71\n00:04:10,782 --> 00:04:",
