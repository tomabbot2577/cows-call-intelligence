    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. I am calling with a unique question. I've been a PC Recruiter user, and I own a business, and we use PC Recruiter, and I've literally used PC Recruiter probably since, like, I don't know, 2010, maybe even before that. But I am on a board of directors for a recruiting association in Colorado. And we are doing a conference, and it's fairly – it's coming up pretty quick. It's like less than two weeks away. And I was wondering if there was anyone who might be able to come from PC Recruiter and if PC Recruiter might want to be a sponsor. I did not know who else to call. And I can't remember his name, Bill. One of the original founders, one of the original developers of the product, met him years ago at an MRI conference. Yeah, Bill Kubitschek. Yeah. How do I, who do I talk to about this? Who do I reach out to? So they probably would be best to go to Bill. And I actually tried to get, I'm sorry, I tried to get to him through the phone directory, and that didn't work, so. Yeah. What is your name? I'm so sorry. Rebecca. My last name is Bain, B-A-Y-N-E. Okay. And the, yeah, sorry. Bain Consulting and Search. but before that I was part of Management Recruiters International and we used it which is why when I bought my I actually bought a piece of that business and started my own company in 2013 I just was like yeah we're doing PC Recruiter okay what I can and I'm sorry what is the conference called it is so this is for Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters we do have a website Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters, and the event is on there. It's on September 23rd. And we are being – our keynote or our key speakers are Greg Dorshing and John Bartos from Next Level Exchange, who everybody knows, like in this industry. John Bartos and who's the other one? John Bartos and Greg Dorshing. Dorshing, okay. Okay. And it's Rocky Mountain Association of Recruiters. I could send you an email with the announcement that you could pass on to him, or is there a way for me to just be able to reach him directly? Yeah, if you just send it to Bill, B-I-L-L, at mainsequence.net, that will get to him. Okay. I will do that. and he's not on vacation or anything right now? No, he's just like owner, like one of the owners he doesn't usually get like answering calls. He's doing whatever he wants to do these days. Yeah, he does Yeah, of course of course. Are you in Hawaii? No, no only he is, but he's actually in Cleveland for the past few months and stuff. Oh, okay. So he's been here he's been here okay well good stuff I'll send that email over and is there any way that if I don't hear back from him is there any way that I can follow up with somebody else or what would you recommend and let me give you his cell phone number too okay let me make sure I have it right I know it's 440 364 440-364-7500. Let me make sure. Let's see. My cell phone, I know it. Yes, 440-364-7500. Okay, perfect. What's your name? Robin Montoni. Robin Montoni. Thank you, Robin Montoni. I appreciate your help. You are welcome. I'll send email and maybe send him a text right now just to get the ball rolling on this. There's a lot of people in this group in Colorado that he knows personally, and I know that I'm not thinking he would be the one to come. That would be fun, but I know there are people in the company that maybe he can send someone to represent PC Recruiter at this event. Yeah, he'd be the person to probably start with because he kind of loves that schmoozing stuff, so you never know. Good. Well, you know, in Colorado, so come on. Yeah. Well, one of our customers said, like, Phil's like the greatest salesperson I've ever met. I'm like, okay. Well, he is. He's like, seriously, he's like really good. I'm like, okay. Well, that's why he owns the company or whatever, is an owner of the company. Yeah. so yeah I would definitely start with him because if he can't and but is still interested you know it would be up to him to kind of delegate who he'd be the guy okay yeah alright thanks so much Robin you are very welcome have a good evening yep you too bye bye",
