    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Good afternoon. Damon, how are you? I'm doing well. Excellent, excellent. I think Garrett's going to be in momentarily, if he's not already. Okay. And what we'll do today, so Garrett's going to be your trainer for PC Recruiter. And today is primarily an introductory call to introduce he and you. He has a few questions he has to ask just to kind of get an idea of how you're going to use the system and some of the integrations you want to set up since your dimensional search we kind of know the basics you'll need ring central hire easy but he has a couple other questions to ask you and then at the conclusion of this call we'll get the first couple to three sessions on the schedule to get you some training on P2C recruiter hopefully ahead of when you're going in for dimensional search training. I'm going to be an account manager for you if there's anything you need as far as adding users. If you need to add users down the line, if you need to ever drop users, adjust your billing, anything like that, come to me. Or if you don't know who to go to, I can help get you to the right person. And then Garrett's going to be the one to go ahead and get you trained on the system there. And I think he has joined. Garrett, Are you on the call? Yes. Can you hear me all right? Yes. I do. Perfect, perfect. So what I said, like I said, I'll turn everything over to Garrett to go over the questions that he has to get you up and trained and running on the system here. Okay. Awesome. Nice to meet you, Damon. Nice to meet you, Garrett. I'll be your trainer. Awesome. So just a few questions here. Do you have any additional admin-level users besides yourself that will be in the database? No, it'll just be me for now. My wife is co-owner, but she won't be involved with any of the business activities for about a year. Okay. That sounds good. So maybe expansion later on. That's good. What operating system do you use, Windows or Mac? Windows. Okay. And is your preferred browser Chrome or Microsoft Edge? Well, I do prefer Chrome, but if I have to go to Edge, I'll... No, that's all right. Yeah, Chrome's great. We definitely develop with Chrome in mind, so that is completely compatible. Who is your email provider? Is it an Office 365 or Gmail? I have Outlook. Okay, Outlook. Got it. Okay. Let's see. And then we're going to, since you are a dimensional search kind of brought in by them, they're going to want to use things like Zoom Info, HireEasy most likely. Are there any other third-party tools that you would want to link to? I think RingCentral also is kind of standard dimensional search. That's all I'm aware of. Some of this I don't know what I don't know. Probably sure I'll go through foundational training, but I am aware of RingCentral, higher easy hands, and so on and so forth. Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. What industry will you be recruiting in? Do you have any idea yet? You don't have to. Yes. Okay. It's Milotech Life Sciences. Awesome. Milotech Life Sciences. Okay. Let's see. What else do we have here? We're going to have, I think Dimensional Search will be importing some name records and things into your database eventually. It's part of what they provide. So I'm just going to make a note that you will be doing some imports, which is great. And then do you have a website that you intend to post jobs on, jobs on to so people can apply and eventually be brought into your database? Potentially, yes. I have a website for sure. Whether or not we'll host positions there, we'll get more direction and probably do our foundational training. Gotcha. All right. Excellent. And that's part of your PCR package. If you do decide to move forward, you'll be able to use something called the job board to post any positions that you create or job orders inside of PCR. Be able to post that on your Web site automatically for candidates to apply to and ultimately get into your database as name records. Awesome. I think that's everything I had. Why don't we get into scheduling your first two trainings? Okay. These are going to be an hour each. And let's see. I'm going to pull up my calendar here. I don't have anything until next week, but I do have a lot of availability next week. What is Monday or Tuesday looking like for you? Monday is fairly open. Just have two spots that's occupied. Okay. Are you Eastern time or a different time zone? Mountain Standard. Mountain Standard. Okay, let me pull up my Google search here. So I have 10 a.m. Eastern to, let's see, Mountain Standard. That means 8 a.m. I have a 10 a.m. slot and I have 1130 slot. Those are both Eastern times. Let's do 1130. Okay. Cool. So that'd be 930. Okay, perfect. 1130 Eastern on Monday the 25th. Okay. And then maybe we could put a day in between So you get some time to click around and work on what we've covered. So we could maybe do like Wednesday or Thursday, if you have any availability. Thursday I have a wide open. Okay, cool. Would that same time slot work for you, the 1130 Eastern? Yeah. Okay, cool. Let's do that. That's the 28th. Awesome. All right. So I'll send you an invite to each one of those. And if you do have questions before then, feel free to reach out to either Jim or I. But, yeah, like Jim said, he'll be kind of taking over any questions you have related to adding users, anything about your contract. And then I'll give you the day-to-day answers on how does this software work. So, yeah, feel free to reach out to either of us. But yeah, I think that's all I had. Any questions for us? When setting up the meeting invite, can you do that through my work email? Oh, sure. What's your work email? I can actually put that in the chat. Okay, perfect. Got it. Okay. D.L. McNeil. All right. So I will make sure to, you know, when responding about training, I'll make sure to use that email address. Okay. Thank you. Awesome. All right. All right. Sounds good. Sounds good. So, yeah, anything you need to let us know. will you update that Garrett up in the system so we have our new primary email addresses yes work okay very well very well all right well we look forward to getting you on board it and anything you need just let me know I'm excited all right thank you for wearing this gentleman for sure have a great rest of your day thank you the same that's you",
