    "text": " Hello, this is Brian. Hi, Brian. My name is Jamie Marks, and we work with a company that uses PCR. And I don't know if I'm at the right place, but I may need technical support. We're experiencing quite a bit of latency. Everyone, every user on our team with PCR. Okay. So we're just looking for a resolution there. Okay. Did you call tech support on this? Um, like I said, I called PCR. I don't know if it was routed to the right person, but is there a different phone number I should be calling? Uh, no, the phone number is good. When you hit option one, you get the sales. When you hit option two, you get the tech support. So I was not aware that there was any, yeah, yeah, no problem. Um, I was not aware that there was any slowness right now with PCR. Um, unfortunately you got forward it out to my cell phone, so I'm out of the system and I can't forward you back to tech support. But if you call the same number and you hit option two instead of option one, it'll get you directly to tech support. Okay, great. I will do that. Okay. Okay, thank you so much. All righty. No problem. Okay. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Thank you.",
