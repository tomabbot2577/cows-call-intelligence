    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. I had a quick question for you. This is Allie with Aquarius Professional Staffing. I was just looking at this, like, AI stuff, and I don't know why I just cannot find how to turn it on in the search bar. Yeah, you can. Well, yeah, you can. It has to be enabled. It was a feature that we cannot just give to everybody only because, I mean, just automatically at least, only because we have to see. Some of our customers, if they've been around for a while, they might have a version, like an indexing version that isn't compatible. So we'd actually have to re-index the database first. What database are you looking to have it activated in? I guess I don't know. Okay. I truly actually don't know what the answer to that would be. Okay, because I see you have Aquarius RN and Aquarius staffing. Oh, it would be Aquarius staffing. It would definitely be staffing. Okay, let me see. And the other thing, too, is we have to have the contract signer signer like kind of put in the request because it's affecting the database uh like john carroll looks like um yep so let me see something here okay so yeah so you're on and i don't want to get too technical you're on what's called keyword version 2 which would not be compatible even if we added the code so what we would have to do is have john carroll submit the request and you can this email support at main sequence but then what we'd have to do is index the database so and actually I feel like your database is pretty big you'd probably enjoy you'd probably benefit from being reindexed anyway because the Lucene searching which is like the newer what it actually it's actually faster but it also searches all attachments okay so let me see I have like an email composed to somebody. Maybe I could send this over to you just so you could share it with him. Okay is there a cost associated with that? No, no we're just gonna yeah we can't I mean that's why we couldn't release it to everybody so we have to kind of confirm this first. Okay so there's not a cost associated with updating the database to a different version. Yeah. like normally we would have but what we can't because of this we can't do it so we're just kind of we're just kind of made the decision that it is probably best that we just kind of go ahead and run that reindex hold on let me see somebody actually sent this to thank you just copy paste it over and you have it Oh, I know who. Let's see. Me. Me. Sorry. Just getting this together for you. Oh, it's probably not assigned to me anymore. That's why. Okay. Let me send this over to you. Thank you. Okay. Hi. I'm so sorry. Oh, you're fine. I'm trying to edit so it makes sense for you. You're good. No, you're fine. Send an email directly to me to confirm we have permission to proceed. Okay. your email is alli.hi at Aquarius dash staffing.com right yes and then is it okay if I cc him on this absolutely okay just get my heads up okay and he's john.carol at Aquarius dash staffing.com okay Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. okay i have sent that over to you and you can either email me he can either email me or just email support we just have to have it because he's then we just don't have like somebody kind of calling up and saying hey change our database without him knowing sure and then how long does that take to get changed so depending on the database it depends like when we started it could take up to 24 hours depends on the size of the database and when we kick it off so like Like we could, once we have his permission, we could add the feature in, but it won't work until that database is indexed. And so it could be up to 24 hours. It just depends really on the size of the database too. Okay. Okay, perfect. Well, then I will, once we hang up, I'll talk to him. He's sitting right here. We'll get this back and hopefully get that updated. Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much. If he even wants to reply back to that email, that's enough for me, and then I move forward. Okay. Okay. Okay. I will let him know. I'll just have to remember it was the, not the RN database. Okay. No, correct. It's Aquarius Staffing. Okay. Yep. All right. Maybe just have him say, like, for the Aquarius Staffing database. Okay. Just so I know which one to affect. Okay. Okay. All right. Sounds great. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
