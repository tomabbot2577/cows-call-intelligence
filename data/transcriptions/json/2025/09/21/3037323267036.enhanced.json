    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Chad Petticord from Iris Recruiting. How are you? Good. How are you today? I'm doing great. Thank you. I wonder if you could help me out with an oddity I'm finding in PCR advanced search. Yeah. What's going on? I'm in the database manufacturing for our company, one of our databases, and I'm doing an advanced name search. and heretofore whenever I've done advanced name search for title I was able to use percent and then the word I'm looking for and then as I understand it getting all the wild card there I'm getting everything before it the word manager is my title and everything after so in this case what I'm trying to do is I'm specifically looking at one company and that company and PCR has 46 records. And if I look at the names list for that company, I see 11 people who have a title of manager in some way or some fashion, like manager of strategy or engineering manager, something like that. But when I'm doing advanced name search now with title and a percent side, before or after it, I'm only seeing a total of four records. What's the name? Are you doing any other parameters in the advanced search other than the title? The company in the company. All right. So the company name, like, what's the company name? Allegion, A-L-L-E-G-I-O-N. So a manufacturing database, Allegion, has 46 records. And 11 of those have the word manager in their title. How do you spell the company name for me one more time? Yeah, A-L-L-E-D-I-O-N. So you're doing predefined fields, company name like Allegion. Yep. And if I do that search then, let's see, title, like, percent manager, and I add it. I get four records. And in my advanced search, my first term was the company name, and then my group comparator was and, and then my next was title-like percent manager. Yeah, let me go take a look at that company here real quick. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Were any of these names added very recently to the database? You know, that's a great question. Let's see data here. Tell you in just a moment. One record was added yesterday, but before that, the earliest or the next most recent record was added April, end of April. And then prior to that, everything was added in like July of 2024 or earlier. So only one record added yesterday. I'm going to go ahead and get you out of here. Do you see what I'm seeing? Yeah. I'm just... You're trying things, I think, huh? Yep. Yeah, it was like restructuring the search. I was doing, it was a different database, but I was doing the same thing almost verbatim. On Wednesday, it had no problems. Didn't have any oddities. so normally with these search issues usually has something to do with the uh search index of the database so what i'm gonna do a lot of times the first like troubleshooting thing we do stuff like this pops up is re-index the database. Yeah. So what I'm going to do is put in a ticket here for you and sign it over to a senior tech to start that re-index. Is that a process we could expect to take over a weekend if it got set up today? Yes. We usually say for larger databases, let's see how big this manufacturing database is. We normally tell people like 24 hours just to be safe, but it can take a little bit of time for large databases because it has to go through all the records. But luckily, each database is stored on its own. So this one is decently sized, but not terribly big. so yeah we can probably get it done over the weekend awesome so what i'll do is i'll just think that's going to happen and then go back and try to rerun something like this on monday and see what i find out yeah and i'll like i said i'll have that ticket for you so in that ticket i'll get confirmation when that re-index is done got it um and then i'll just shoot you an email in that ticket and let you know. And I'll obviously test it on my end as well once they tell me it's done. Awesome. I appreciate it. Yep, not a problem. So you'll get an email here soon just letting you know that that support ticket was open for you, and then any updates will come through that same ticket as well. Awesome. Hey, thanks for your time. Yep, not a problem. You have a great day. You too.",
