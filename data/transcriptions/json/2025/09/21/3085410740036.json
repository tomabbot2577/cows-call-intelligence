    "text": " Please hold while I try to connect you. Hi, this is Chrissy Stone with Fusion Recruiters. I'm sorry I missed your call. If you're reaching out about a current search, partnership opportunity, or just hoping to connect, please leave your name, number, and a brief message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for calling, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Hey, Chrissy, this is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I just wanted to give you a call on TouchBase to follow up on your account. It looks like we have dropped you down to two users, so that adjustment has been made. Your data return ticket is in queue. It should be processed soon. We just kind of tagged Mackenzie in that to get that processed this morning. So I wanted to kind of check on that and just let you know that that's going to be coming soon. And I also want to confirm you are keeping the two users on until May when your contract is up because that was my understanding, so I thought I'd follow up and see. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Please give me a call just to confirm that you are, in fact, staying on at the two users, and let me know if you have any other questions at all. Thanks. Bye-bye.",
