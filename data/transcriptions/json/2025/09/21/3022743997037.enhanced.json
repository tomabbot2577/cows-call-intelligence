    "text": " Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Oh, hi, Robin. How are you? It's Adam Kaplan from CapThera. Hi. How are you doing? Doing great. I wanted to check. It looks like it says invoices have been processed and there's a receipt, but then it also says there's a payment overdue. Can you let me know if payments have been taken or not? Because I keep getting conflicting emails. Okay. Let's see. consulting You have a July 1, July 20th, which is paid, but then June 20th is still open. Okay. I have no idea how that happened because they were both automatic payments. All right. So, yeah, I'm wondering why. because you paid so we did switch invoice systems yes and we moved you away and then so it looks like your first one on july 16th or april 16th which is like the makeup or what what a process you paid that one a week later on the 23rd and then the may one was paid on the 19th but then this june the may one was not paid until june 19th but why was it june 20th because you We probably set a bottle for you by then. Let me see. You know, I had spoke with you, and then it wound up being late because it said it had processed, but it never did one of them. And I think we paid that. And then it seems like if the June 20th wasn't paid, that was supposed to be the next one. But it wouldn't make sense that the July one was paid if the June one didn't take. So I don't know. Yeah, on June 19th, it paid the May one. Let me see. Okay. Let me see if there is any kind of transactions. Let's see. There's some card declined on June 20th. Okay. Do you want me to try it now? You know what? Let me give you a different one. I don't know why. It doesn't work out well when I try to replace it for you, it seems, because it wants you to, like, put in, like, extra details. Let me see what happens. Can I try to cross the screen? You can send me where I can just update it myself and then process it with you on the phone? Okay, thank you. Yeah, let me see. Customer portal, send invitation. Now your more recent one looks like, let me see, invoices. Where is I? I was in history, transactions. Your last one on July 20th did go through, but on January 20th, it didn't. so it might just be trying to reprocess this one. All right. So now it's asking me to create an account. Yeah, so if you have not been in the customer billing portal, you'll want to create an account. It's just for billing. It doesn't use anything related to PCR. Okay, so let me do this right now and just make sure we're in here. So it's in the vault area where you can manage your card. But if you want to delete the card, you've got to turn off auto-pay for it first. Then it lets you delete it. Okay, let me just get into here and put a sign up here. Okay, I guess I'm human. Now log into my account. I just use my email then, correct? Yeah, and make sure you use adam at capstarrow.com because that's the account we have for billing. Now it says invalid login attempt. I just... And you set up this billing part. Did it ask you to create a password for the site? It did and I just you put in the password that I just created and it's now it's saying invalid login attempt. Did it say anything about it's going to email you to make sure it's you? It did not refresh my email no nothing that's okay now I'm in all right let's see here so it's in the vault area where you manage the card. Vault, okay. Okay, so before it lets you delete a card, you have to turn off the auto-pay option in the vault area for that card. On invoices, go to no. Okay, now hit save on that? Yeah. Okay. Then it should give you a list of your cards and then you can delete that one? It doesn't give me an option to delete. It gives me an area to put a new card. Okay, it doesn't list what cards you have? It does. It doesn't. I don't have an option to delete it, though. Oh, no, that's a different area. Sorry, I was looking back where it said involved. Now I see. So delete this one. Yeah, you've got to be in that involved area. Okay. Now that's deleted. Okay, so then you're adding a new payment method. New card, okay. so let me get to that now let me just find that Okay. auto pay for future transaction save and now hang on a second Okay, select. Now where do I, does it go to say make payment? Is this, I think I just found the auto pay. So that's in the invoice area. Okay, invoices it shows. Invoice number. See, it didn't take that card. It's saying still pay with that old card. Click here. Let me see in the vault. It still has that card saved even though I got rid of it. Okay. So when you, so do you have two cards listed? It's only showing one. I'm trying to put a different card in. Let me delete this again. This is payment will be deleted. Okay. Please cancel auto pay before deleting it. Okay. So over at the auto. I think when you're in the voluntary, it's like above. It's like a yes, no drop down. Yes. And it's on no. And it said save. And it just. Okay. I clicked it again. So now it says it did this before to auto pay was successfully disabled. So let me go back to, I'm deleting this one. And now it shows, it doesn't show that there's any card now. Please select the payment method first. All right. Yeah, I see that it's off now. It was showing it's on before. Okay. Now, can I, it's showing edit payment method. Okay. invoices. I can go there now, do it over there. Or you can just do it right here in the vault. You can do it right here in the vault area. So the vault. So click new card towards the vault area. Yeah. That's what I tried to do last time, but all right. Let me see if I can. Okay. Now do I want to click on where it says enable auto pay for future transactions? Yes, you can turn that on. Okay, now let me hit save. It brings it right back to the card. Oh, no, no, this should work. Okay, hang on a sec. Oh, you know what? You know what? I'm putting the – that's the problem. I had the wrong card. I'm putting the wrong card in. Ah, that's on me. All right, let me do this again. Sorry about that. This is just off. Okay. Okay. Okay. One more time. I'm going to go ahead and do that. Okay, let's see. Save this. Accepted by terms and conditions. Let's see if this works. You have one auto-pay and one open. Would you like to pay the invoice? Yes. Okay. Thank you for setting on a paid invoice. Okay. Did it go through? I'll tell you one second. I'm just going to wait until it, I'm going to wait like 30 seconds. Sometimes it takes like a moment to show. Okay. Invoices. Oh, you know, now it's in a different era. See, I don't want to pay twice. Can you see if anything was trying to be processed? Wait a second. Let's see. Okay. Autopay is 2006. That's the new card. Invoices. Okay. It's saying there's still one open. From June. Let me see. All right. If not, I can go and I can. Sale approved. Oh, that was 720. Hold on one second. That's not today's date. Today's the 21st, right? Yes. Okay. Let me go to invoices here. Select. Let me see if this will work. Yeah, under invoices, do you see it listed as an open invoice? There's one that shows that it's late, $88.66. So let me see. It says pay invoices. Let me see if that works. Actually, before you do that, hold on one second. Is that your normal rate? Okay, that's your normal rate, right? Okay. Just want to make sure, like, no late fee was added or anything like that. and I would have taken that off you. Yes, now it shows it was just processed on 7-21. Okay, let me make sure here. For 88-66. Receive for transaction. I just received it. It is showing as paid now. Okay, so now that this is good and I created that account, this should just process normally now. Right. and if you ever want to change your card you just go to that vault area and then you can do it yourself it's much more updated than it used to be it was very, we'll just say manual before alright well hopefully this is it it's just weird that one processed and one didn't but whatever, it's done, it's paid and the card is in there so hopefully we're good for next time you should be good let me know I hope I don't have to but thank you for your help again you are welcome have a good week you too thanks a lot bye bye",
