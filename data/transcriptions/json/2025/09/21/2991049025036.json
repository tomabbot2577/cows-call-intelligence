    "text": "Hi, this is Barry. Here's the new message and I will call you back. Thank you. Hey Barry, it's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give a quick call. Make sure you got the email that the data has been moved over. Mackenzie sent that out a little over an hour ago, so the data is moved over to your new Cornerstone Building Solutions database. Note, he changed the password to every username in the database to the same thing. It's in that email. And also note, I want to make sure you don't make any changes to the old NIT Building Solutions database any longer, since that's not going to be what would be in your new database now. I want to talk to you, see about the cancellation of that, when that's going to happen, and when you wanted to get in queue for that to happen. I talked with Scott. He was hoping to keep it for like another week, maybe until the end of the month, which I think we talked about, so we can just kind of go back and refer to any setups or details or formats or anything like that. But give me a quick call. Let me know what you think on that. And make sure you've got everything set up and you need out of base. My phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
