    "text": " Thank you for calling MainSegular Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, hi there. It's Bonnie Lewenstein with Excelsior Executive Search. Happy Friday to you. Happy Friday to you as well. How can I help you today? So I noticed something. This is not the first time it's happened, but now I'm aggravated, so I figured it's time to call support. I have, it's the, I don't know what you call it, but it's the thing that's on my Gmail, the PC recruiter. So if I wanted to import a resume into PC recruiter right from email, it's that app thingy. And today, for example, I had a meeting where notes were transcribed and I got that email and I wanted to attach it to the hiring manager I talked with. So when I brought him up, it's not allowing me to do that. The only icons that I can see, for example, is the little edit icon under this person's name, roll-up list, and position. Like the one where you could add a resume, for example, is another one. Not even there. Now let me pop in and take a look here. and yeah and I don't know that I can't figure out a rhyme or reason as to why sometimes all the little icons are there and sometimes they aren't because I know there's one that's also it's not even just add a resume it's updated an attachment or add an attachment and that one's gone Let me, mine is loading up here. So are you doing like a search in the tool, in the Gmail tool? I did for this one, yes, because for whatever the reason, it didn't automatically refresh. It had the last person on there, so I had to do a fresh search. it's not automatically refreshing either. I guess we should say that too. Now, how long do you leave your email open? All the time. At least during 8 to 7. Okay, because that can cause tab sessions and stuff to time out. Okay. Can you try refreshing your email tab and then reopening the PC recorder one? Yeah. Okay. Okay, so I refreshed Gmail and now let me go to the PC Recruiter thingy. Okay, so no record found, which of course it wouldn't be because this is for Gemini Notes. So then I go to... Yeah, to the name record. So adding options. So I do I actually I don't want to manually add the record do I? I want to do a search. So I go so I do the back arrow on PC Recruiter and then if I search for this gentleman's name and by the way it doesn't let me I can only type a first name in. like I can't go to the next last name field until it brings up everybody with the first name of Derek is there a way to around that too unfortunately not we're very limited in what gmail allows us to do gotcha with this okay then it's not a big deal like I just as soon as it brings up people I just type in the last name and then I found him okay so I found the candidate or the hiring manager I hit select and it's the same thing yeah only three things it's letting me bring up our edit roll-up list and position yeah I'm seeing the same thing on my end here so it does say where you can view attachments then you can log in and add one that way let's see if there's something in the settings here yeah and I know I mean if I had to I if I did that but the thing is like sometimes all of these little links come up so how come it didn't for this dude let me try searching someone else here Let me make sure that there hasn't been a change made to that tool. Okay. Thank you. screenshots we have in the Learning Center don't have a way to add attachments. I can for some of them. It's like I can't figure out why I can for like 75% of them and why I can't for 25%. That's why I'm so confused is it's not like I've never been able to do it. I can do it frequently. But okay, so I'm going into PC Recruiter. Log in. now if I go to add attachment how do I find it from the email like just add file yeah I'd have to download it first I guess yeah I'm going through I've gone through like 8 or 9 candidate records and all of them have the same options Let me see if I can give you one. Hold on. I might be able to give you one. Sasha, let's see if I can do it with Sasha. So strange. Can we have that tool back? Or that feature back? I can put in a feature request for it, but my guess is that was done... Due to like a Gmail limitation. So I can ask about it. Like I said, I could put it in our internal feature request, but there's a good chance that that was something that Gmail was limiting us on with the add-in. Well, that just sucks for them. Here's one more. Let me try one more and just see. yeah it's your no no no here's one here's one on my email I got a response from someone named Jacob McGraw, M-C-G-R-A-W. It's in my Gmail. He sent me an email September the 15th and he attached his resume. Now I'm looking at the email with the resume attachment and it's giving me the option to edit, roll up list position, but also add attachment, update resume, create candidate. So that's because it's a resume. It handles those differently than regular attachments. Okay. Okay. But today, earlier, the same thing. I got a resume from a candidate named Sasha Loftus. It didn't give me the option to add a resume. Was the document named resume? Okay. let's see, Jacobs is called Jacob McGraw resume. That's what his is called. Let me go back and look at Sasha. Sasha was called resume PDF. Now, it could also be... No, and wait, here's her thing to add a resume. I can see it, update resume. So they're both called resume. Yeah, so when it reads the resume attachment, but it works differently because then it can allow you to just add the new resume as an attachment, update their resume or create a new record based off the resume. But for regular attachments, you're not going to see that. Would you put in a request for me? Yes, I would love to be able to add attachments from my email because now I got to download it and then find it and it's a pain in the patootie yeah I'll put it in a feature request for you I oh and this one isn't even a download it has to go to my drive oh yeah yeah okay well all righty then sometimes I love gmail and sometimes I don't love gmail but same reasons I don't necessarily like Outlook. So, oh well. The big box email hosts can be hitting the butt. Yeah, they can be. Alright, so it is what it is, but at least now I understand that it's not a problem necessarily with my system. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, the system is working good. It's just it has to be a resume or an attachment with resume in the name of it so the system realizes it can upload a resume. Got it. All right. Well, at least I know. I'll let you go. Thank you. Yep. Not a problem. You have a great day. You too. Bye-bye.",
