Thank you. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail you're having trouble in PCR. Sorry we missed your call. Let me try you back via email and maybe we can get that sorted out for you. It sounds like you just want to create a custom field on your company records. So I could just give you some instructions for that. But yeah, let me know you need more help. And yeah, expect an email from me. Thanks.",
