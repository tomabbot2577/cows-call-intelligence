    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. We're just having some delay issues here this morning. We're just wondering if you guys are aware of any issues. What's your name and what company are you with? My name is Pamela Fenninger, and I'm with the Carlisle Group. Okay. Let me take a look. We haven't gotten any reports of anything this morning, So let me just try to log in to your database. We have also one person who said that they have some things set up on their PCA. They see our home front page, and they're getting an error message that says invalid query where they normally have statistics. Okay. Which database are you accessing? I'm in insurance. Okay. Let me just log in there. Are there specific actions you're taking that are slow or is it just everything in general when you're moving around the database? Just moving around the database is taking a long time for the pages to flip. And like I said, there's a thing on my front page, query, and there's a red thing beside it that says that it's invalid. Okay, what's your username under the insurance database? It's just PLP. PLP, okay. Log in. Yeah, it's taken a long time to load the MyPCR bottom half of the screen for me as well. when I log in under PLP. Okay, let me just try to jump between a few pages here. Okay. Yeah, it is a little bit slow. I can see the lag there trying to load new positions. Okay, and I'll go back to my PCR. Yeah, I think I'm getting the same thing here. I'll report it to our tech team and have them investigate. Is it just the insurance database, or are there other databases that are experiencing this? So far, it's just an insurance that's reporting. Okay, awesome. Let me open a ticket, and I will get back to you as soon as I hear anything from our tech team. Great, I appreciate that. Thank you. No problem. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Okay, bye.",
