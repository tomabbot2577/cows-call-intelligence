    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. Hey, I am trying to use Capture on my PCR, and it's not working. So I'm thinking maybe I have to update it, but I'm not sure how to do that. When you go to the extension icon, the Manage Extension icon, it's like a black puzzle piece kind of at the top right. Hold on a second. There's a black puzzle piece. Yeah, tap right of your browser. Okay. Hit that. Click on that and go to Manage Extensions. Okay. Okay. And? Okay. Do you see PCR Capture listed as an extension? No, it just says access online forms, Google Docs, offline maps, directions, and PCR capture. Okay, so you do have PCR capture listed. Oh, yeah, yeah, I do. Okay, click details on that card, and what is the version number? 1.2.2. Okay, so that is the correct one. where it says pinned to toolbar. Is that turned on? I'm looking for that. Where's that at? So when you're in the details about the extension? It says on. The very top thing. So then you should be seeing your capture extension at the top right. It's a blue, green, and purple type of hexagon? No. I'm on a screen that just says PCR capture and it has on. Okay. So that was your managed extension screen. Now, next to, because if it says pinned to toolbar, right by that managed extensions icon, do you see the PCR capture extension? No. Do you want me to go back into it? Okay, so pen toolbar is on in that screen that I had you go into, right, with the details about capture? Here, let me, I'm going to turn it off, and then I'm going to turn it on. It says developer mode. Okay, so on the card that says PCR capture, you should have a details option, right? No. Okay, so when you click directly on your manage extensions icon. Well, here, let me go back. So I'm here. I'm under extensions. I'm under PCR capture 1.2.2. So I'll go into details. Well, first of all, it says service worker inactive underneath there. So you're, I think I'm wrong here. So at the very top right of your browser, you have the manage extensions icon, that black puzzle piece. When you click directly on that, do you see PCR capture listed? Yes. Okay. And is it pinned? Yes. Okay. So right up by your manage extensions black icon, you should see our extension icon. It's a blue, green, and purple hexagon. Right. Okay. Click on that. Click on that. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Is it connected to a database? Like what do you see? Do you see like a bunch of LinkedIn sites listed or is it asking for a URL? No, I see LinkedIn sites listed and it must be logged in because it has, you know, it's in basic mode, dark mode. Okay, so are those gray or those blue where it says basic mode, dark mode? Gray. Okay, so that's good. So when you go to somebody's LinkedIn page, you have to actually be in their profile. That's when it's popping up over at the right. Yeah, and it's not. And it just, this just started, like, I don't know, a couple days ago, which is weird. Okay. And I can't even do it on my laptop either. It's not working. Okay. Probably best we do a screen share. I'm sorry, what is your name? It's Jodi. And what is the last name? Knight. Knight. Is that with a K? Jodi Knight with a K? Yeah. Pinhook? I'm sorry. Yeah, pinhook. Okay. I'm going to send you a meeting invite. Okay. Or like a meeting link. I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't need to do it as an invite because we're not scheduling it for later. Where are you sending this? On my email? Yes. Okay. Let me get rid of... Okay. Okay, so Google Meet. Okay, so in that, you'll click on the link that I sent you. I did, and it says download Chrome or Firefox or Edge. It should recognize that you have a browser. What browser do you use? This is Safari. Okay, you'll have to, yeah. Do you have Chrome? You'll need to go over to Chrome. because if you're in Safari and on LinkedIn, you won't be able to use Capture. You have to be in – if you were in Chrome where that extension is, you have to go to somebody's LinkedIn page in Chrome, so that could be why it's not popping up. No, I'm in Chrome. When I'm doing the LinkedIn, I'm in Chrome. I just don't have my – hang on a second here. You're going to have to bear with me. I'm on my old computer I should have went on my laptop so that extension is a chrome extension so when you go to somebody's page you're going to have to be in chrome for it to pop up and recognize okay just here bear with me for a second here I gotta I gotta forward this I should have went on my laptop actually let me go on my laptop hang on a second you're probably like oh I'm going to have a slow Friday and then I call there are no slow days well every once in a while but not too often Okay, hang on a second. I'm trying to... I wonder if this is... Okay, here, join... Okay, you're on my laptop. So you have to open that link I sent you from that computer. Okay, is it working? No, did you go to that link that I sent you? I did. Hang on, let me get back out here. Yeah, the join call link? Yeah, that's a meeting link. Right. now it says allow notifications not sure on that one yeah I don't know why this is ready to join ask to join okay ask to join okay okay so it's going to ask you about probably computer audio or your camera. You don't need the audio since we're already on the phone and we won't need your camera. I'm going to have you share your screen instead. So if you can go to the bottom of that meeting window and you're going to click the share screen icon. It's the rectangle with the arrow pointing up. And that's going to pop up another window. And you're going to have to go over at the right where it says entire screen okay I did okay you're gonna have to click there it goes okay okay so I'm gonna have you open up a new tab because I don't want to mess around with this meeting window if you go over to another tab perfect okay so you're in Chrome right now I do do see where it says new Chrome available. But first let's click on the extension. Let's see what's happening. Which extension? The Chrome? No, no, the the PCR capture extension. Okay. No, no, no, at the top right of your browser. Okay. So after the address, you'll see like a little key, a star. It's that blue, green, and purple. No, over to the right. You just passed it. That's your PCR capture extension. Okay. And you're connecting as admin, correct? Yes. Okay. And you'd like to get the company and all that. Okay. So now if you, in this browser, Chrome, if you go to a new tab, and were you trying to use it on LinkedIn? Yes. Okay. So go to somebody's LinkedIn page. oh there it is there it is yeah so you do have to be in chrome so if you were in safari you would not be able to use it. No, but I know, but I, okay. I can't believe that just came up. I have been in Chrome. Okay. So I don't know why, like on my other one, I have several computers here. Well, you may have to add that extension to the browser on your other computer. That could be the issue. Did you have that same icon up at the top on your other computer? um so i'm going to have to add pcr capture to that computer yeah if you don't have it where it's like syncing apps and stuff you would probably you would have to add it to your browser on that computer okay because it is it is added to my browser right so if you don't have it where like if you're not seeing the same things like where your apps are syncing and stuff, then you may not see it under the computer. If you don't have the extension showing up in your browser on your other computer, then you would have to add it on that computer. Okay, so how do I add it on the other computer? So on the other computer, you would have to open up your Chrome browser and then you'd add it from the Chrome Web Store. I could send you those instructions if you'd like. Okay, that would be good. But I'm wondering because I've always used it and it's never been a problem. It just stops. You would have to join the meeting from that computer. I don't know. I can't see what's going on. I don't even know if you have it over there. Right. Okay. Okay, well let me, why don't you send me that and then I'll try to figure it out. And if I need, at least I have it on my laptop now. Okay. All right. And I will get that over to you. I'll send it right now. Okay. Thank you. Have a good one. You too. Okay. Bye. Bye.",
