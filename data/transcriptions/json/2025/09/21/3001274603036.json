    "text": " Hey, Robin, what's up? Hey. All right. Okay, I swear to God, it was somebody that was in collections because I was looking through activities or something, and it was like an email that they sent out. Okay. What was the activity? Oh, maybe it was Peterson Consulting. Hold on one second. because there's some I think this is where I found it yes they emailed Jim Lombardo asking if it was like legit like is this like kind of spam email and basically what did they write this was an odd email and I just want to bring your attention I don't know who they are or how they got my email address. And what is this for? So BMC Consulting, so Brian Michael Cain, has been providing consulting and technical services around Peer Secreter for over a decade. It's now IT Logistics, whatever. And we were introduced by two of the longest-serving experts behind Peer Secreter, Brian Cain and Jared Yusmani. so together at IT Logics we continue to support PCR clients like you we know the PCR recruiter inside out we answer the phone, we solve problems, we care because we've been there since the beginning whether you're looking for support guidance or just some help to help you navigate the path forward so that's the only place I've heard or seen of that, nobody's told me that I just saw it in an email if you go to like Peterson Consulting Group you don't even have to go to the person just go to company and go to activities just some recent activities dated 5-22 Peterson So, I guess it was sent to Todd Schall. You said it's under their email activities? I don't see anything here. Under Peterson Consulting Group. I just went to the company activities, but it was sent to Todd Scholl. S-C-H-O-L-L if you want to go to his name. Yeah, it'll be easier if I go to Todd. But that's how I thought it was going to the company activities. And I don't know why I had a dream of that. I don't know why I thought of it the next day. I'm like, did I have a dream or did I really see that? Remember what I was telling you? I am stoked. Oh, that's funny. Oh. We know many users may be experiencing difficulties with support or more things questions. I'm assuming I mean I know we have some kind of like deal with Kane on that because he technically is I don't know he's like a contractor he's like a contractor I think but I don't know if they should be aren't you like not supposed to be I don't know he definitely has something signed with us I don't know about Jared. I don't know what the deal is with that. I don't think you can limit somebody from working. I just think the direct thing without saying anything is a little questionable. What is the... I'm just saying sending out emails to clients when... I don't know. But if Brian's done stuff with them before, then that's fine. Whatever. I'm just like weird I don't know I'm a little weirded out by all these people that just like quit one day aren't you still weirded out by that with us you mean with us yeah like any time at the time so I like I don't know what did they know that we they were all like one day like boom um i think the i mean like the receivership is like a big thing that's like yeah that a lot of people decided based on that and we were like uh the money stuff and getting paid a lot of people choice based on that um which makes sense i like to understand why they did it when they did but got bills to pay, yeah. Yeah. I don't know, it just seemed like it kind of, yeah, it happened, whatever, it's not as bad. Like, you know, it kind of resolved decently. I wish some of these good ones didn't, like, let's say like a Sean, you know. But I guess when you don't know, you're going to just try to take care of yourself. Yeah, but also, I think Sean had been, he had been, well, he had been looking because of the like paycheck stuff that we had all basically all year um and the job that he got like it was too good as an opportunity to pass up oh really no yeah he got it was more pay um the hours were a little bit better and he got like the benefits were there he had like stock options and stuff like that. Good for him then. And obviously we lost our vision and dental. Oh, both. I'm on my husband's insurance. I was annoyed. We lost it right before I had a dentist appointment. It was super annoying. And dental stuff is not cheap at all. I can get my own plan i just haven't looked at it yet um but i went i used it a lot last year so i'm not super super worried about it um but at least it's not yet i just got close and they said something about steve said something in the one email about looking at the other options although i don't know that i really believe that but whatever like i don't think they're yeah i've been on my husband since we got married. It's been a long time. I just got to worry about that. Although even his insurance has changed. The first year we were married, I think it was... Let's see. He fell off our roof and had knee surgery and then I got pregnant with my son. So in that first year, year and a half, we didn't pay a dollar. Like literally a dollar with two major expenses. for are you talking about for um like with what he has like who you have yeah what um what insurance is it through medical mutual our insurance is also good and i like our human insurance was good too now they've changed some things where like oh you know that now you'd have like a copay which we never had but then they give you this hsa account that they put some money in so yeah i don't know so i mean thank god for me that like after the deductible is met that they cover my infusions because those are like over three thousand dollars every time i go and i think we're almost up to four now um what do you what is your deductible i think it's and this is where things have changed. I think it's up to like 2,500 now, or it's a lot higher. I don't even remember what it was. But there used to not be one at all. It was like nothing. You paid nothing. But at least with me, I've never really had to pay anything because when I go for my first infusion at the end of the year, they have me, it's like this, through this pharmaceutical company, it's like this assistance program to help you cover your infusions. So they cover it, But then my insurance picks it up, so they really only have to pay for, like, one. So I really don't pay for any of them. Every once in a while I'll get, like, an invoice for $100. That's how my thing is because I have, like, a shot in, like, blood work that I get for, like, prep. And that's also covered through, like, a program like that. So I end up not really paying anything because that is also like, it's like $1,900 for the stupid shot. But insurance covers like 80% of it or something. And then, because it is preventative. And then they have like whatever the structure is. But our deductible is not that bad. I pay for the more expensive plan, but it's $500 for the deductible. And then there's co-insurance for like $3,000. so once you hit $3,500 then you pay nothing after that it's like a little different yeah ours I think I can't even remember what it is now but then they also put money on this health insurance card so that if you do have things like co-pays or whatever but most of mine for the co-pay they never even bill me so I don't know it's kind of weird I haven't figured it all out but usually it's like oh there's bill came in I just run through the copay card yeah and the copay card is what helps with whatever and they put money into it so it hasn't really been an issue thank god knock on wood oh shoot I forgot that I have uh Robin I have an appointment but I have to go to it I'm gonna go do that but I will talk to you later okay okay sounds good thank you no problem bye All right, bye.",
