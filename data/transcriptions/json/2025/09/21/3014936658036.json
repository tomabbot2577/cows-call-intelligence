    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Conrad from On Point Search Group. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good. So, yeah, I was just following up. I was trying to get this AI feature to work, the name search. search yes so with the ai trial features um they weren't a part of the initial like trial just because it does require okay a certain database search update so essentially there's kind of two different search indexes there's keyword two and lucene and lucene is required for the AI search. So let me pop in and see what you have. So you have keyword version two. So what that would mean is I can submit a ticket for you to upgrade to Lucene and then enable the AI search. But like I said, we have to do that first and it can take a little bit. Just depending when we do the upgrade, we have to then re-index the entire database to that Lucene index. So we usually tell people it takes a little bit, but you'll be notified when it does happen. But then we can enable that AI search part for you as well. Okay, so it's a little bit, meaning like a couple days or something? Yeah, we have a lot of people requesting an update right now, and it is a senior tech that has to go through and do each one individually. Yep. So, yeah, like a day or two just to be safe. Okay. All right. But if you'd like, I can submit that ticket on your behalf and then kind of go from there. Yeah, that would be great. I appreciate that. And I guess I'll just hang tight. I mean, the other features seem to kind of work, but just not that. that feature, you know, with the AI, the new AI features there. Like I said, the AI search one, all the other ones were automatically added to the database, just not the AI search as part of the trial. That one has to be turned on by us manually because of that necessity for that Lucene index. I see. All right. Well, I'll hang tight then and wait for that to get turned on. Yep. Yeah, I'll submit that ticket right now and then as soon as it's done that it'll be uh you'll hear back from someone on our team saying that you're all ready to go all right sounds good appreciate it yep not a problem need anything else just let us know we'll do thank you take care",
