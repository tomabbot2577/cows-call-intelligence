    "text": " Good morning. How's it going? Good morning, Garrett. Hey, let's hop on a quick screen share so I can take a look at your sequence. Okay, cool. Okay. Okay, so am I in the database yet? So sequencing. I just paused this. Okay, edit branches. Oh, yeah, here's the email, and then repeat conditions. Hit the go back and activate it. Go to tasks. Go to view queue. Make sure they're not there. You have to wait for the bounce to register in your iMap. I did get it yesterday like as soon as I started the sequence I got the email here did it download in your IMAP in PCR mail though oh I don't know go to his record now that's Steve Smith go to activities you'll see the opt outs there now oh okay And then you'll see right after the opt-out downloaded, he completed the sequence. Oh. Well, wouldn't it say, like, status sequence is complete or something? It almost looks like he's in limbo based on how PCRM had him listed. Like in the – let's open that real quick. maybe it's more of a PCRM display issue maybe showing the wrong thing but yeah so it has him pending rather than sequences complete so he's like feels like he's in limbo maybe which is a little strange yeah that might be a PCRM thing okay so the sequence... You know what? I'm going to create a second sequence where the condition is move to step... Instead of sequence is complete because it's harder to see that happen. Yeah, move to another step. Yeah, okay. That's what I'll do. Yeah, let's do that real quick. We'll do it live. All right. So I'll just create a quick thing here. Add email to... Yep, and then if you want to use that same record again, just make sure you clear them off the opt-out list. Okay, yeah. So it's just whatever form letter. I've got to make sure it has an opt-out link. It does. No sense here. So what's nifty about the opt-out link is, like, the opt-out unsubscribe. Mm-hmm. You don't have to have the opt-out link in the email. Oh, okay. For this. Excuse me. God bless you. All right. So we'll say. Yeah. So one of them can be that LinkedIn connection request. Easy. And then maybe one of them is a. Yeah. Other action. I would just call it bounce or something. Okay. Bounce. So we know that's where the bounces are supposed to go. Perfect. Okay, so get rid of like something like that. Get this one to be complete. Up here, if opt out or unsubscribe, jump to step three. Okay, and then if no conditions met in a couple minutes here, I think 15 is the lowest I can go, right? I would just do like a day just to be safe. Yeah, let's do a day. Just so it doesn't accidentally end up. Moving, yeah. Just continue to the next step. Yeah. Okay, and then these don't matter. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. It's fine like that. Okay. Sequence is complete. No one's going to end up in step two. Yeah. That I care about. Okay, save that. Check for problems. Good. All right, so let me get that guy off of... Or actually, I'll just grab a new name and give him that email. So I don't know. These people I never use for anything. This guy. Okay, this is... I'll just do, like, TylerBad at mainsequence.net. Bad Tyler. Because we know that doesn't exist. Right, perfect. On our command. Jim Darcy. Let me get him on a roll-up list called Bad Emails 2. There we go. Back here, activate it. Bad Emails 2. This is going to be today at the Eastern time zone. Roll-up list, Bad Emails 2. Okay. I think we're good. Yep. Activate that. So now we'll wait. Let's bring up your regular Gmail. I'll show you a little trick. Oh, already came back. All right. So now what you can do, go to PCR mail. All right. Let's go to the sequence first. Go to Tasks, then View Queue, because that's where it should be. Yep. So what you can do now, click the X on here, go to your PCR mail, go to your Gmail inbox, and do get new. Ooh, those notifications are showing up. Yep, so now that that's in there, go back to the record. Go to the activities. See the opt-outs there. Now go back to sequencing. Go to view queue. Ah, okay. You go to overview and then tasks. It's like reload tasks. Bam. Bounce. Okay, he's in the other and then a bounce. Yep. So the... It won't register the opt-out for bounced emails like that for the first step until it downloads in your IMAP that it was a bounce and then that activity is written. Okay. So did he... So he doesn't... Okay, so he doesn't follow the opt-out condition, though, if it's a bounce. He doesn't go to, like, step three bounce. Yeah, he went to step three bounce. Look at the tab. Oh, he did? Okay, let me... I like checking PCR because it has... Let's get that sequence tab back here. Bad emails too. Yeah, okay, he did. He's in bounce. So if you look at the sequencing in 9 as well, you'll see it says step 3 bounce. Oh, I was just thinking it was, okay, got it. Yeah, he's in step 3 bounce other. I was like, oh, did it show up in other because it did the bounce thing that, never mind, never mind. No, it's because we created that other task. Yeah, it was just another task. Okay. All right. I think it's working now. So maybe because I did the condition of sequence is complete, it was too hard to really understand and see that that happened, where moving them to another step for the bounce was able to. So let me see what he said on his ticket then. No, I'm on a different ticket. Steven Fine. Oh. Okay. So he said, I set up a test sequence called New Balance Test 3 that has the opt-out unsubscribe button, and then I added Ryan Joseph to it with a bad email address, but she moved to the next step, LinkedIn connection request, instead of completing the sequence. Let's go take a look at his sequence. So he did the complete sequence of the condition too. It's under security. At least I know that part. And sequencing. View. Test three. Okay, so he had, yeah, he had if no interaction occurs in 15 minutes, continue the next step. Yeah, so he probably, his IMAP. Maybe the PCR mail, yeah, didn't update. Yeah, I've seen that happen. So if it was a normal sequence where he's waiting like a day or two, it's going to work because it all depends on where he was in that sync cycle for PCR mail. It's not constantly downloading. Especially if he has a sync grid in the middle there. It could even take longer for the opt-out to register back over to PCR. Okay. That all makes sense. Good detective work. Awesome. So, yeah, you got to give the... So let's go to that person's... Who's the person that was in there? Ryan Joseph. Yeah, so let's go find Ryan Joseph. For the activities. I didn't register not at all good it is I map I don't know if I'm signed in as Steven is what's his username oh it's just Steven okay Uh-oh. Which one is he using here? That's going to make a big difference. Mm-hmm. Disconnection. Login failed. He doesn't even have his IMAP set up. That's the issue. I checked this at the beginning of the ticket, I thought. Maybe it's from a different user? No. I'll tell him about that part because that's the biggest... Yeah, get that set up with him. Okay. Oh, no, no, no. It's a different user. Okay, wait, wait, wait. I'm wrong. Ryan is the username. Let me go back. Sorry. I was like, whoa. Well, that would explain why his test didn't work, though. If he's sending sequences, he needs to do that. Oh. We'll need to fix Stevens anyway. Right. But I'll check this. Yeah, I think, yeah, we're just discussing his test. You're right, you're right. And his test wasn't going to work no matter what. Yeah. Yeah, his test is never going to work no matter what. Right. And I think we know why this wasn't working. Yeah, we already explained to him that the bounces, just general bounces, aren't going to show up in other for this guy up here, his initial question. Okay. Cool. I think we got enough to go back with for sure. Yeah. Okay. All right. Cool. I'll let him know and I'll get his IMAP set up and tell him about the 15 minutes as well, all contributed to this test failing on his end. Yep. All right. Perfect. It's probably mainly the IMAP, to be honest, because you can't register or bounce if the opt-out email doesn't come back in the PC recruiter. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I would just go back to him with that for now. Cool. And if he has any more questions, just let me know. That sounds good, dude. Well, I'll be talking to you soon with Ed McGill, I think, anyway, at night. Yep. All right. Talk to you in a few. All right. Sounds good. Bye. All right. Bye.",
