Okay. So there was an issue late last month where the Outlook was not accepting even the correct password, but we have fixed that with the latest version of the Outlook portal. So I can send you a link to download the latest version. I think it will fix that particular issue where you won't have to change your password. Gotcha. Okay, great. Okay. Well, if you could send that link to me at bob at monprosearch.com, which is the email on the account, I would appreciate it. Awesome. Got that here, Bob. Yep, there it is. Okay. I will send that now. And yeah, just click the link to download it. Once it downloads, open that file to run the installer. And it just kind of hitting next a few times. And you should be good. If that doesn't work, definitely call us back and we'll continue to troubleshoot. Okay, sounds good. Let's start there. All right, awesome. Talk to you soon if you have any trouble. Thanks. Okay, bye-bye.",
