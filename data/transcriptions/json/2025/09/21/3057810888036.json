    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Mike McClain with META. How's it going today? Good. How are you doing? I'm doing good, buddy. Are you guys, do you have less support techs now, or are you just busier than normal? The reason I ask is I called yesterday. I think it was yesterday. And, yeah, I called again today a couple times. and it just it's like like i wait i don't even know how long i waited earlier i ended up hanging up or i don't even know if the answering machine came on i don't know but it was uh are you guys down guys or yeah yeah we've since the last few months we've had a lot less support team members so we're working on a much smaller crew but uh yeah if you do leave a message we are prioritizing those um it opens actually a ticket on our end that it was a voicemail was left so we prioritize those and try to get back to you as soon as possible if you do leave a message i didn't i didn't okay that was my fault i was like i'll just call him back later it wasn't a big deal um well gary reason reason i was calling um i'm i have a ticket open with jason um okay i was just curious if he was available um i thought i'd go through a couple things with him if he wasn't that tall. We just were in a group support meeting a few minutes ago, and he brought up that ticket asking us, so was it the one about Lucene where you were upgraded to Lucene and your advanced search was a little bit different? Yeah. So one of the users today, she's our PCR pro, like she's well-versed in PCR. are she said that the last couple days she's noticed when she brings up she tries to do an advanced Boolean search and she showed me this morning what she did and it produced like a crazy number of results like she was looking for a payroll I don't know payroll admin or something like that and you know she went through the different criteria for the advanced search and when she pulled it up it pulled up like 7 000 results and i was like she's like now look at when you start going through these results like a lot of them don't even pertain or have at least that we couldn't find any information as to any of the search criteria so she's like i don't even know why this is pulling this like somebody's names up so okay anyway yeah so that was that that was the issue so i was jason had asked if i he just sent me an email asked if we could produce exactly what search how did we search for it so i just okay yeah i just emailed him back and asked him if he wanted to do a screen share sometime tomorrow but then i thought you know what i'll give him a call and if he has a minute i can tell him what they were looking for and he if he wanted to because he said he wanted to try to duplicate it on his side yeah that makes sense Yeah, he was going to say, yeah, I'll just get an example and then we could pick it apart as a team if it doesn't end up being what we expect as results. So, yeah, that's a good here. Let me see if he is available. Let me check one second here. Transfer over to him one second. Yeah, I went to his voicemail. He might already be on a call. so let me let me just leave a note with him that you know before the end of the day I mean oh there he is calling me back one second okay yeah he just let me know he's jumping out of training with somebody so yeah why don't you connect through email and pick out a time maybe for tomorrow and I'll just yeah leave him a note to check his email No worries. No worries. That's perfect. I'll, uh, we'll communicate back to Park Street, you know, I just, I honestly thought I had a couple of minutes if he did, but it's honestly no big deal. So, okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Thank you. Yeah. Reach out if you need anything else. Okay, buddy. You have a good day. You too. Bye.",
