    "text": " We have to schedule you. Tyler, what are you doing? This is Ernie. Hey, how's it going, Ernie? Hi. We're having an issue with the extensions for capturing info from Zoom Info and from LinkedIn. And it's for an Apple MacBook. And he's using Chrome. So what kind of issues are you having? Like is it just like not showing up or? Capture. I have not downloaded the Zoom info one yet. That's new. With the PCR capture, it just doesn't. He doesn't seem to be able to capture with the PCR capture tool for LinkedIn. Okay. Now has he logged into the capture tool? so when i click the click the capture tool icon enter your url and then when i click log in nothing happens so you need to so your pcr url will be the same as your like login page for when you go on to pc recruiter you'll need to copy that and paste it into that box and then hit log in and that should be the same for zoom info after i log in i copy the url you're saying no so you'll copy the url from the like your login page for pc recruiter okay and then where it says like enter your pcr site url you paste it into that box it'll have like a blank, like a generic placeholder there. You just need to paste over that. Am I copying the URL before I log in or after I log in? Before you log in. And that should be the same for Zoom Info? Zoom Info is different. I'm not sure how their extension works. You would have to call them for that. Really? All right. Now I have Zoom info extension on my computer. So I can't edit that. Like when I go to click. Yeah. So just click at the front of the box. It'll put the cursor there and then hit paste and it'll paste over it. All right. Let's see. Okay. And just click log in. Okay. Yep. And then it'll have you put in your PCR credentials, like you're logging into PC recruiter. Now if I go to Zoom Info and I hit manage extension, that ID for Zoom info is unique to me or is it unique to just Zoom info? For the extension? Yeah. That I'm not sure. Like I said, Zoom info is a completely separate entity from us. I'm not sure. It's interesting. How come? Database is industrial. now yes now i see under zoom info automatically allow access to the following sites and one of them says recruiter app staging zoom info whatever and then there's another one says recruiter app zoom info.com is recruiter pcr no pc recruiter would just be pc recruiter well then how come I can get into it and it doesn't say automatically allow access on the following sites so that's just what sites you're allowing the extension to have access to well I'll have to call zoom info alright thank you don't go away So you should have that PCR capture page now where it gives you like the list of sites. Yeah. So you can click the X on the top of that little box. So now if you go to LinkedIn, like go to a fresh LinkedIn page or like reload the LinkedIn tab, when you go to a profile, you'll see PCR capture pop up on the side of the page now. So let's say if I go to... Anybody. So just the regular or do I have to go into recruiter? Okay, wait, I have Zoom. You could do regular or recruiter. It works on both. Okay, do I click welcome to Zoom info? I have that. So how do I get to Zoom? What do I do? Oh, for Zoom info? I'm not sure how Zoom info works. PCR capture. PCR capture. Hold on. Yeah, so if you go to, like, LinkedIn... Yep, I'm on someone's profile. Well, you don't have to... Here's the capture here. Yeah. And you should see it pop up on the side, or you might have to refresh the page now that you've downloaded. I have to click the icon. I have to click the icon. Okay, cool. All right, cool. Thank you so much. Yep, not a problem. Awesome. Thanks. Bye. Thanks.",
