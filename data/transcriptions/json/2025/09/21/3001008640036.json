    "text": " Thank you for calling Meme Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Oh, hey, Mackenzie. It's Sean DeGroseler. How are you doing? I'm doing fine, Sean. How are you? Good, good. Hey, I got a question for you. I got a user on my account that for some reason his fields aren't showing up. He's basically got a field that's missing that I don't know why it's not modeled after my name fields and I want to see if you could help me so it models mine or so at least it's got this secondary email field in there on his. I can't see it so I don't know how to have that secondary email field. Can you help me? No problem. Could you spell your last name for me, Sean? Yeah, it's D-E-S-G-R-O-S-E-L-L-I-E-R. going as SHAWN and then with Vitality Group. Thank you. All right. So let me pull up Vitality Group. Go into your database URL. All right. There's only one database. Great. Could you tell me the two usernames in question, your username and the one you want to target? Yeah. Yeah. Mine is SMD and then his is GAB, Gavin. Log into both just to get on the same page. I'm just going to see exactly which fields you're talking about. SMD, I'm logged into there, and then I'm going to go into another tab of the browser and log in to GAB. let's type my password one second yeah okay there's a name record field yeah it's a name record field okay the first name one of your guys thing and then so let's let's start with yours let's like which is the field you want them to see well mine has primary email and secondary email and he's saying his only has primary email gotcha okay let me find this email secondary okay right there okay so it's the one two three four five six field down all right let me see what he sees he says one two yeah okay it's totally different yeah it's way different okay um yeah so you uh clearly have two different setups. Let me see. What do you have? Do you have admin permission? Okay. Your username has admin permission. If you can log into SMD, I can just walk you through how to copy your layout over. My settings. Yeah. I shouldn't do this for you, but you have access. Go to system and then user. We're going to first make sure your username is a model user, which it is. I can see it is. To check this in the future, you go to manage users and then select SMD. Then under information, username, it'll say model user yes. That means you're able to copy the settings of this user. Now that we know that that is there, then yes. Then go to where you were going before, copy users. Did you already do this perhaps? I thought I would. Yeah, I normally do this for anybody new, but maybe I didn't. All right, well, I guess there's a world where it's broken or something. So, yeah, so copy user settings. There's a window that appears. Source username would be yours, the one you want to copy from. Yeah, you want to select, like, the layout, right? So under name, company, position, record, you want to search or you want to click record search layout. You want to click the box for name. You could also do record card, which is like the card you see in like the recently viewed. If you want those to be the same, too. And then you should be able to select his username and then hit save. And that should do it right. We should definitely do that and check and see if it copied it over. because if it didn't, something could be wrong, I guess. Okay. It definitely used to work. Does he need to log in and log out? Yeah, Gavin probably wants to log in and out. I'll do that same thing on my end. Did you put it through? Yeah, I did it. Okay, I'm going to log out and back in with Gav, G-A-V. I'm logging in to look at the name. I'm looking at the first name in the list. Yeah, I see the layout changed. I see primary email. I see secondary email. I see a lot of other fields changed. I'm flipping between. I'm going to flip between tabs and make sure they stay the same. Make the screen about the same size. Yeah, it looks like everything's the same now for him. Awesome. Looks good to me. Hey, thanks for your help. I appreciate it. Yeah, awesome. You're welcome. Okay. Sean, have a great rest of your day, Sean. Thank you. you too man appreciate it bye bye alright",
