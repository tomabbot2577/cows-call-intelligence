    "text": " All pro. This is Kelly. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a voicemail here. We were kind of playing phone tag a little bit. Do you still have time to go over some questions you had about PCR? Hey, yeah. I'm sorry to call you it on a Friday afternoon. No worries. OK. Where are you located? We're in Cleveland, Ohio, suburbs of Cleveland. Oh, OK. All right. So you're what, one hour behind? Yeah, currently, let's see, I'm at 4.44 p.m. That's where I am. Oh, okay. Oh, I thought you guys were an hour behind. Oh, no, yeah, we must be same time zone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's great. So I know it's Friday and it's late, but I really just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Kelly. I'm the controller. I've been here for almost 10 months now. So I'm just under a year. And we're going through a lot of change here, which is all super, super positive. And I am welcoming myself into the year 2025. And I am going to get more involved in this PCR system that Jen's been using for 23 years. or something a long time. I don't know if it's been 23 years. So anyhow, yeah, so I just, you know, I have a lot of what I think are really simple questions. I don't think they're complex. I just don't know how to, like, get in touch with you guys. Do I do a ticket? Do I call you? Do I email you? You know? Yeah. You can, any of the above. So, yeah, the support line you called usually works. If we're not there, definitely leave a message so we know to give you a ring back. And then also emailing support at mainsequence.net with any questions. We can get back to you that way as well. Okay. Yeah. Has anybody, since you're kind of newer to diving into PCR, just want to, It sounds like you want to just know more about the system in general. Has anyone showed you our learning center? We have some videos and screenshots with step-by-step articles and things like that. Has anyone showed you how to get to that at all? So we did training. I think we did three trainings over the last year. We did it with Robin. I can't remember the other guy's name. Oh, okay. And I think they pointed that out, but I don't know if I – I think it was just too much information for me at the time. So that's probably – that's where – I can start there. So is there like a – or if you could just send me a link to the tutorials, I can play around with that this weekend. Sure, yeah, you can take a look there. So the best way to get there is if you're actually in PCR, do you have PCR pulled up right now? Sure do. Awesome. So at the top right by the profile picture circle is a little gear icon. If you click that, you'll see a drop-down menu and learning centers towards the bottom. Oh, okay. There it is, learning center. Okay, cool. Yeah, that'll get you there. And it looks like you're using the version of the software called PC Recruiter 9. So once you get to that learning center, you'd click on PC Recruiter 9 and look through those articles for whatever topics you need. You could also use the search bar. My favorite part, though, is in the main menu at the top of the learning center, all the way to the right, it says webinars. These are the pre-recorded videos, like their trainings in themselves, basically just recorded about each topic. So those ones I always like directing customers towards because it's sometimes easier to watch a video than read through a whole long article. Yeah, this is really good. I need an intern to do all this for me and then teach me how to do that. um so I'm gonna write that down because we do need an intern okay okay cool so I'm gonna do that thank you um can I just ask you a quick like short-term question oh yeah for sure okay so we have so I'm pretty familiar with PCR I've been using it like I said I'm the accountant so I do payroll and we've switched over from hard time sheets to electronic ones so I've I've really had my hand in it. But I don't want to get my hand too much in it because I'm also doing the payroll. You know what I mean? So I'm a little, you know, I don't know how much, anyhow, that's a separate conversation. But we've had, so we have payroll next week. And we've had some issues this week with an employee not being able to clock in. So she's called all week and I've taken down her hours and I've inputted them into the system and I think I've done everything on my end. But when they have a question about like the app or the software or anything like that, who's supposed to be answering those calls? Us? Usually, usually the, yeah, usually the contractor or the person that's, you know, trying to sign in would call you guys, the PCR users. and it's usually they need like a password reset or some of the time it does help to like uninstall the app itself and then you can send them a link to reinstall it. Usually are the best troubleshooting steps. But do you know how to? Yeah, we've been doing that. So I've done that. Jen's done that. And there's still an issue. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Let me check here. I can pull up your database real quick. It's the AllPro database. Yes. What's the name of the contractor that's having trouble? That would be me, Kelly Mundell. Oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, you're the employee. Yeah, no problem. Oh, yeah. I was like, I'm the employee that's having trouble. That's why I'm calling you. Oh, that's really funny, actually, when you think about it. Okay, hold on. Who was it? Oh, God, this is a name for you. Oluwotoyin Akanubi. Okay. I'll need a spelling on that one for sure. Okay, just type in Olu, O-L-U, and then hit search. There we go. Oh, wait, I got Olu Adibo? No, Oluatoy and Akanubi. Oh. OLU? Yeah, first name OLU. Olu. I'm still just getting Oluadibo. You do have two databases. So is it not the AllPro, but the default database? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was supposed to say that. Jen told me to say that. Yes, we are the default database. okay whatever whatever whatever that means okay yeah no worries yeah so when you're when you're like logging into PCR you can choose between the two databases that your account has one called all pro one one's called default database and it looks like yeah I want to log into this other one and then oh interesting you guys don't have an I usually just log in as the username called admin what's your username to get into PCR? I think it's just KBM. Is it just the initials? Yeah, that worked. That got me in. Okay. So let me try that again. O-L-U search. Okay. So we got Oluwayatoan Ekanubi. Cool. Let me see. There is a field on here called identification. Okay. Okay. So have you gone into the field called identification? There's like that little arrow icon to the right of it. it'll open up a window where you can enter a different password and then you can send that to them. Wait, can you repeat that one more time? You're on their name record and identification is a field. It looks like it's on the right towards the bottom under the group called info. Hold on. I'm on Alouette Toyin. Right. Yeah. So look through, there's different groups. There's like candidate info, job info, assignments. Below assignments is another group called info. Oh, I don't see what you're looking at. I don't see any of that. I see edit name, resume, pipeline, activities, roll up notes, attachments, history. Right. So yeah, if you're on edit name you should see all those fields yeah first name last name so yes scroll yeah if you scroll down a little bit there's an info group on the right yeah yeah yeah info group identification na right perfect yeah just click the little icon to the right of that na number okay yeah it'll Open a pop-up window. On the left, click on Web Extension. And this will give you a few options to help the user. One would be to enter in a new password in both those fields. And you can, like, check a box that says User Most Changed Password at Next Login. And you can supply them with the password. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Hold on. I just messed something up. I was in the Enter Password. I clicked on the enter password thing by accident, and it all disappeared. Oh, could you hit cancel at the bottom right? Yeah. Okay, phew, I just got out of there. That was scary. That was really scary. See, this is the thing. I'm scared to touch anything. I'm scared I'm going to break stuff. Right. No, I mean, that makes sense. It's good to be cautious. But yeah, at least for this this person here, you can put in a temporary password. You enter it and hit save and then make sure you check the box that user must change password at next login so that they can, you know, you can email them and say, here, try this password and it'll be the one that you set. And then it'll prompt them to put in another password that they set. But there's, let's see, I think, oh, yeah, on the left, if you go to the other icon that says mobile apps, there is a button to click here to resend invite to the timesheets app. So that could be helpful as well. If they want to just uninstall the timesheets app, you could resend that invite email. Oh, wow. That's crazy. All from that identification tab. Yeah. Yeah, so... Why do you do web extension over mobile apps? Web extension just on the left has those options related to the password. The mobile apps button on the left is the only thing really to do in there is to resend the invite to download the app. Okay, click here to resend invite. But shouldn't you do that first? Yeah, you could do that as maybe a first step. Yeah. Has this person ever been able to enter information in and clock their hours or is it just. Yeah. No, she's been she's been with us for like nine months. Maybe not that long, but she's been she's been here for a while. So I know there's a real issue. Mm hmm. Interesting. OK. Yeah, I guess my first step would definitely. Yeah, I would have her uninstall the app altogether and then you can click here to resend the timesheets app and she'll get it reinstalled. That might that might do it. If there's still an issue, maybe a password reset on your end that you send to her to try. Okay. And if that fails... Wait, so I'm sorry. So a password reset. What I'm seeing right now, it says to enter password with all these... I can't see the password. Is that the password that she created? Yeah, that's what's sitting in there now. But you can replace that with something temporarily. And check the box right below that says user must change password at next login. and then just let her know, hey, I temporarily changed your password so you can try it and you'll be able to confirm, you know, this is a password I set where you know what's capitalized, what's not, things like that. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Oh, very, very helpful. Thank you so much. No problem. Yeah. And those are the first two steps we usually try with contractors. But if you do have trouble after that, definitely call back in. We'll continue to troubleshoot. Yeah. Okay. That sounds good. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Any other questions? Anything else I can help with today? No, I don't think so. I think that was enough for my little lesson. Good. Okay. That sounds great. Yeah. Yeah. Take a look at those learning center materials. If you do have like different features you want to learn about, but yeah, we're always here to help if you do have specific questions on the support line. Awesome. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. All right. Have a good weekend, Garrett. You too. Bye. Okay. Bye.",
