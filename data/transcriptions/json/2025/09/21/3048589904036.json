    "text": " Hi, this is Scott. Good morning, Scott. Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Jim, I'm doing well. How's your morning going? Not so bad so far. Awesome. Well, I appreciate you giving me a call. And sometimes it's easier just to peel the Band-Aid off real quick and let you know. So I wanted to let you know that and talk to you about logistics around we will not be renewing our PCR subscriptions. OK. Very well. And yeah. What what led to the decision or what was lacking or what's going on? Just so I can share. Yeah. Oh, and I'm very upfront with things. And so it's easier just so it doesn't help if I'm like coy or anything like that. So we're going to relate. And the biggest challenges we've had with with PCR are two main things that kind of caused us to make the change. One of them was just PCR. PCR. And again, we've had a long history with PCR. So don't take this as me. Like, I don't want to be mean knocking it or anything. It's just it's always been. And again, some of it might be self-induced. It's always been kind of like a file cabinet where, hey, we store information, but it's been very difficult to actually use, like the sequencing around things. But really, it goes back to the metrics that we have tried to track. It seems like with PCR has always been extremely difficult to extract out. And we always have to run multiple reports. And then we've got to have our people manipulating those reports with just how things are structured. So that's been very difficult. The other thing would be around just having the kind of ATS CRM function. We don't have any visibility on business development with PCR. And so Crelate has a very souped up version of that where we can really see business development pipeline and those types of things. So those are the two things, and then you add in just the agentic AI that's in the new living platform of Freelite. It kind of takes it over the top. Okay, and it looks like we were too late with our sales pipeline. We released the PCRM product. Had you looked at that at all before you made the decision or anything? We did. And it just seems like it's, Crelate is just so much easier to use from our perspective. Again, I don't want to really argue anything today. It's just kind of like, but I, that's kind of the main thing. Again, it's, Crelate's more expensive. And that's what really has prevented us in the past from going somewhere else with PCR because we've always held on to PCR because we just, we haven't like bought a lot of the add-ons and stuff like that. When we're using PCR, we've just kind of been like, Hey, it is what it is. We'll use it how it is. But now our hands being a little bit forced with how the industry is going with AI and all those things. And then also sequencing it just PCR has always been a lot, it has been difficult for us to really set up the sequences. I think the other thing that I would say, I don't want to go here too strong, strongly, but it feel, it has always felt like PCR to bring PCR up to today. It always seems like it feels anyways, like it's like, Hey, we've got to, we've got to do things on the backend to fix PCR, to get it to up to today. So tweaking something causes issues with something else where Krelate just seems like it's developed a little bit more for today. That's just personal view, right? I appreciate that. But we have no ill will towards PCR. We just feel like going into the future, we think for at least the next few years, Krelate's the better option. I literally have no negative feelings towards PCR. our PCR help does get to where we need it to be today. We appreciate your business over these several years here. So I would assume you'll be needing a data return. We will, and I would tell you, this is kind of where the logistical stuff I wanted to ask you about. Because we do, so this is, we would like to have a data return, if at all possible. We'd like the data pulled on Monday, September 8th. Okay. But my question is turnaround time, because it would be nice if we could pull the data and then get it on Tuesday, September 9th. Is that possible? I think it is. I don't do that, but I think it is, because what they do is they will take the data, back it up, and then they will make it available from a download link, and they'll email that to you. So I think they should be able to do that. The best thing that I can do is put in a ticket to start getting things prepped because they'll need to send you a form to sign to get the data return. They'll need that signed by whomever is the signer. It's me. Yes, it is you. So it's you. So you'll be the signer. So you'll sign that off. I think there's a $1.75 cost to get that back up. But I can put a request on the 8th and see if they can send it on the 9th, and that will give them some time to look, make sure they can do it. I'll even kind of ask them to let you know and confirm that they can do that. Yes, please. Perfect. And then I was going to say, and this is where it's going to sound kind of weird, but we actually, I'd like to keep PCR on through the completion of our contract, which is, I believe it ends the end of November. That's what it looks like. I know that sounds weird, but I'm kind of paranoid about making a switch. And so PCR is still the backup. And a lot of people do eat a lot of times lately when people are switching over to anything. They keep their PC recruiter. They'll finish out the contractor. They'll keep it for another year or anything like that. So that's not uncommon. So, yeah, we'll put in kind of cue that we know you're going to cancel when the contract reviews. It's not going to renew end of the year. Awesome. And then, Jim, I was curious, who do I need to give notice to? Do you want me to email you? Email it to me for now. I put in a ticket to my accounting team, and then there's a few people that work on that, and they look at the contract and make sure you're paid a date and see when the cancellation date is and all of that. So they would kind of work with that. Okay, yeah, because my terminology is just we're just not going to renew the contract. Yeah, so I can put that in queue into that and get them rolling with that. But, yeah, just send it over to me. You've got my email. Yep, yep. So sorry to be the negative guy today. I hate starting talking to someone that I've never spoken with before saying, hey, we're not going to use your software anymore. Sorry about that. No, I get it. I appreciate you being upfront and candid about it. And you'd be surprised how many people are like, no, I just need a backup. Everything's fine. And I just appreciate you telling me. I've been doing this 26 years. So I appreciate just the upfront because it's not going to be for everybody. Well, and I also am one of those believers that you never know. We could circle back around in time. And I don't want to burn any bridges because PCR may have a souped-up version in 10 years that we want to come back to, right, or five years or whatever. So it's like I try very hard not to burn bridges. and it's happened before. So yeah. Let me go ahead and get things started on this. I will put in the data return, get that in queue to make sure that can happen by the 8th. I think it should be able to be quickly turned around, but I'll put that in queue. And I'll kind of include here, once you send me the thing, just that you're not going to be canceling, or I mean that you're not going to be renewing, so we'll be canceling once everything's out. Perfect. And I'll put in there, I'll even put in that note. I'll say, hey, I'd like to pull our data on, on Monday, September 8th, and get the copies. Is that possible? I'll put that in there, too, so that just makes it easier if it's all in one place. Fantastic. Yeah, send that over. I'll get it in. Okay. Awesome. All right, Jim, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I'll get it. Take care. Thank you. Bye. Okay, bye.",
