    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. This is Tyler, happy to help you. Hello, I'm just calling about a general question on PCR. And what I'm looking to do is, I'm hoping you can tell me the best way to do it. So I'm looking to do a search on all client files added by a particular user that have either notes attached to the client file or attachments added to the client file or a job position added to the client file. So in order to do that you would probably need a custom SQL query. We do have some that are kind of pre-built. Let me see here if I have one. I might be able to just write one up here for you real quick and put it on your my piece of our screen I was just thinking is that so there's not a standard way I can just do a search like that no okay So it's like all company records that either have a note, have an attachment, or have a position? Have a note, attachment, or position, yes. And by added by a certain user. Yep. Let me find this real quick. Now, is it just companies that are assigned to that username or where positions were assigned to them? Sorry, say that again, sorry. What was the username part that you needed? any clients that so the clients who they've been added by it's two particular users okay perfect that should be no problem All right. While I do this, just so I don't eat up too much of your time here, what company were you with? It's Walker Local. And what's a good email address for you? I can email you as soon as I have it in there for you. Megan dot sorry I was going to give you my personal and then and Megan at Walker level calm is that me gan yes perfect yeah give me a few minutes to get this query put together and test it out I will shoot you an email when it is available on your myPCR screen. Okay and then what do I need to do sorry? So when it's on your myPCR screen it's it'll be under what's called custom stats and it'll show you I'll give it a query name you'll just see like a name of the stat and then a number and you'll click on that number and that'll show you all the criteria okay and then what were the user names and so it's jet Jennifer M Jennifer M or Lucy J Perfect. Okay. So it's all... Now, for these company records, are they designated as clients in the system, or do you want it just for all company records? Oh, I don't know if they'll be designated as clients. What would determine whether they're designated as a client? So there's a field in company records called default company where you can mark them as a client. But if that's not a field you use on a regular basis, I can just exclude that part and do this for all company records. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, maybe all company records. Okay, perfect. That's not a problem at all. Okay. So it's all companies with an attachment, a note, or position where the company has a username of Jennifer M. or Lucy J. Yes. Perfect. And, yes, that was it. Perfect. Like I said, I'll shoot you an email here in a few minutes once I have that ready to go for you. Okay. Thank you. Yep, not a problem. Talk to you soon. Thanks. Bye.",
