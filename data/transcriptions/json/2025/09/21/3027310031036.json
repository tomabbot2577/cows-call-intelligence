I wanted to see if you would give any more thought to PC Recruiter if you were thinking about moving ahead with that. I actually had quoted you a little high on the setup. The setup is actually 250 is what I did for the other two gentlemen that also had previously worked for you. So I wanted to give you a quick call, kind of follow up with you and see if that was of interest to you. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Give me a quick call. Let me know how I can help. Thanks. I'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye.",
