    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Stuart West. I am calling on behalf of ETS Dental. And they're having an issue with email. I don't know if you guys will be able to really do much about it or not, but I figured I would call. It looks like the messages, so they're using POP3. Okay. There are some messages that have started coming in the end of last week and throughout the weekend where the subject just says no subject and the body of the message is kind of incomplete. We can see it on the 365 side, which is the back-end server that they're currently using, and it looks fine there, so it seems to be just a syncing issue with the POP3 client. And I can give you an example. I don't know if there's anything to be done there or what we can do. Yeah, because we just download what they send us. so if they're not sending the entire message which database is this in? I'm in ETS Final although I think the email is the same. It's under LS Norman is the user. Alright. It's in their mail server. Yeah, it's the Yeah, it's the 365. Let me look at her. She only has the one, so it's Office 365. And then is it in their inbox? No, so if you look in deleted items and you'll scroll just a little bit, you'll see a bunch of unknown. So the from is listed as unknown, and then the subject just says no subject. And some of those you can kind of piece together what the message was based on the little bit of text you can do through the view source. And I can see the corresponding message in Outlook, and it's, you know, fine. It's just the PCR side that's not getting it. Yeah, I mean, there's nothing we can really do about that. Because, like I said, we just download the messages as we receive them from Office 365. My suggestion would always, especially since it's POP3, that's such an outdated and old syncing feature. The only thing I would recommend is IMAP. yeah and I think they're working to go that direction so it may be something that they just still have to deal with if it continues to happen I think by the end of the year they're going to move to Google Workspace where they are setting them up as IMAP so yeah like because I'll put it this way if I sent this up to a developer about a pop 3 issue the first thing they're going to say is move them to IVAP. Yeah. Okay. That's fair. That's kind of what I thought I would get, but I figured it was due diligence. I'd give you guys a call. Let me talk to Laverne and kind of keep her in the loop, and we'll go from there. I would just tell them, like, hey, POP3 is an old feature. We can only download the message as they send it, so if there's any type of break in the connection while it's downloading, there's nothing we'll be able to do. Okay. All right. I will let her know. All right. I appreciate it. Thanks. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",
