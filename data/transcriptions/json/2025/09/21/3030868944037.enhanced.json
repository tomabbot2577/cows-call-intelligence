It looks like he's actually unavailable at the moment. I could get a note sent over to him though if you wanted to leave a message with me. I'm with Rumble Ad Center. Wanted to get in contact with them, kind of touch base, see if you guys would be interested in using our space as an additional way for advertising, and I thought you'd be the right person to talk to. I can leave you with my phone number if that works for you. Go ahead. Yep. Best number to reach me is 629-236-8875. Okay. Awesome. I'll get this sent over to him and I'll have him follow up with you. Okay. Thank you so much. Have a good rest of your day. You too. Bye.",
