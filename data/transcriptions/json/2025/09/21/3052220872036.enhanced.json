I got a message from Robert saying that the card was rejected, and it was rejected because the account was compromised, and so I had to get a new card. And, of course, when they sent me the new card, they left on the old expiration date and so on and so on. So here's the new card. Okay. Okay. Bear with me one second. Let me do a couple things here. Okay. I've got to turn this off first. Okay. Jim Orman Water Jobs. Yep. I got you. Okay. Hold on one. Let's see, historic payment methods. Okay, I'm going to take this one off.
