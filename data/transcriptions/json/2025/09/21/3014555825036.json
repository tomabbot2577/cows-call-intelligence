    "text": " Hey. Hello. I'm an idiot. Has a search to narrow my status at Overlook. Oh, the positions? Yeah. Yeah, I did that at first too, but I don't experience any slowness. I don't either. So, I think it's something else. I mean, Brian Crane put in a ticket like, oh, they have slowness than five other people do. This does not appear to be us. Yeah. I actually called to see if you could do me a quick flavor. Yay! Chocolate or vanilla? Cereal number. Mmm, Froot Loops. Yeah, I don't have the... What do you call it? Oh, the portal? Yeah, I don't have it on my new computer. I have my old one sitting up here. Hold on one second. Because I got sick of trying to ask people. and nobody knows how to install it. Jared was really the only one. Maybe Sean, but Jared. Obviously, that's not... Yeah, Sean used to do it too. Oh, does he do it too? Okay. Yeah, that really sucked. I just talked to him like two weeks ago too. I'm just... You know, even though I didn't work at the office, I worked with him for 20 years. Watch that kid grow up into an adult, basically. Let me go into this one. Oh, my gosh. This laptop is so tiny when I go over back to it. How did I work on this thing? Oh, my gosh. No wonder I'm always fumbling my fingers because the keyboard is, like, tiny, and I have nails right now. Okay. Who are we looking for? I just sent you the number. Oh, you did? Okay. On Discord. I just need to make sure it's... Log in. Hold on one second. What is this? Not expired and set to three licenses. Okay. Hold on one second. Crap. It's just like all... Yeah. Hold on. I got to figure out what my password is for Discord. Yeah, I can just read it off to you if that's easier. Yeah. Let me know when you're ready. Okay. Hold on one second. I also don't have my mouse on this one, so I'm, like, using the little touchpad, which is a little awkward. I'm a little slow here. Okay. PCR license. Here it is. Okay. I literally have two laptops up. Okay. What's the number? 199. 027 1-9-9-0-2-7 Hold on one second. Everything's trying to open on me. Okay, 1-9-9-0-2-7. Sorry about that. 4-3-8 3-8-4 8-3-2 Okay. Okay. Test name for portal license. Why is that the name for it? that's just what's on the company is under okay okay so there's three with nobody being used and it expires june 2026 oh that's where they were getting the why is this a test name one for portal license instead of a person's name i don't know but that test one for portal license It's actually on the company record. Okay. Who's the customer? Eesner Advisory Group. Okay. Here, let me try this way. Make sure I use the right number. E-I-S-N-E-R? Yeah, E-I-S-N-E-R. Okay. That really should have a person's name with it. Now, are they actually set to portal licenses, or did they accidentally do, like, soft phone or something? I don't know. it'll tell you what type of license it is next to it I'm going to put that number back in again make sure I've been hit oh it does say soft phone three sites yep that's the issue okay so if you do that you should be able to do like add license okay and then you can select portal portal outlook site count three yeah they did soft phone and they didn't put a name in it so I wonder how I can change that part so they need three and then what do you want me to do for expiration just a year for now a year from today okay today is July I don't even know 14th okay July 26 three portal license Save. Should I take off the soft phone one? Yeah. Okay. Remove. Yes. How can I look up customer by ID? I want to see. How can I change this? We really should have a name with it. I have no idea how to do that. Hmm. What is this? I wonder. Get licensed file, maybe? I have no idea. I typically don't mess with it. Just to be safe. I don't want to break something. I hear ya. Should I be checking that no update check? No. I wonder if I could put the name with it. Okay, try it now. Hopefully I did it right. I usually just go into the portal one and hit edit. I'm not really finding license update check. I think I feel like... I wonder if I can just type over this. No, it doesn't let me. All right. Well, the numbers should be working at least. Yeah, I just sent her an email saying, hey, we just reset it. Go ahead and try it again. How come it didn't remove that softball when I thought I did that? Okay, let me see. PCR license. Customer ID. Okay. I don't know how to change a name with that though. I'm not finding that anywhere. Yeah, that's above our pay grade. Hmm. I wonder if I can just pull it from here. For portal license. I'm not getting an option to edit, it seems like. Yeah. Can't figure that out. But hopefully this will work at least to get them working. Yep. That's all that matters. Whatever works. That's my motto lately. Yep. Whatever works, then move on to the next thing. Yep. Alrighty. Thank you, Ms. Robin. Alrighty. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
