    "text": " Jim, how are you? I'm well, Nabil. How are you? I am very well. Thank you for getting back to me. So I just wanted to give you a quick update on those things that we're sitting with Tech High, okay? Because you called me and I didn't have that answer at that time, right? So we're getting closer to looking into one option, but if that doesn't work out, then we're going to look into this software outside. So that's going to be on Monday, Tuesday. I will have some answer for you if we will be open to look into the PCD crew to bring in, right? So I would know this Monday, Tuesday maximum. And what we are trying to do, I can tell you that, what we're trying to do, we're trying to talk to XLR one more time if they could think about it and let us know because they might have some solutions that we are looking at. We are already using their services. We have the contract and everything. So that's what the meeting is all about, that we will have to decide if we are going to go with XLR or we will not be going with XLR, right? So I'll keep you posted. On the other note, I also wanted to ask you about, because you know my plans, what's going on here with my situation. Yeah. And the first of September is going to kick in, and I'm completely in a panic mode because I'm late to be very upfront with you, applying things and everything. So it will be done, application will be done in a week's time, one week time maximum. And then I will be thinking about moving around in, not in September, it's going to be October or November by looking at the timelines. So I might send you an email or a request, not right now because I'm trying to get things done as soon as possible so that maybe we will not need it. but if they might be able to ask you, instead of starting from September, maybe we can push it to the November or date or whatever. Shouldn't be a problem. We should be able to arrange that if needed. Yeah, just let me know. Yeah, okay, fantastic. And just want to give you a heads up on that, and I'll keep you posted on this as soon as this development comes up to me, okay? Fantastic. I'll wait to hear from you mid-next week once that meeting happens. All right. Yeah, all right. Thanks a lot, and take care of yourself. Have a wonderful day. You as well. Okay, bye-bye.",
