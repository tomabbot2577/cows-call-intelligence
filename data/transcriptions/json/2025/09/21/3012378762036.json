    "text": " Hello, this is Brian. Hello, Brian. This is Conrad calling from On Point Search Group. How are you? Good, Conrad. What's going on? Good. So I had a quick question about the new AI tool. Okay. Yep. So I don't see, when I go to the search tab there in the candidate area, I don't see that toggle appearing. Okay. So which area are you in exactly? So basic search, you know, when I'm looking at candidates, you know, the name records. Now, it does have to be turned on. Did you guys have it turned on? I didn't turn it on. I thought it was automatically because some of the features work, but this one doesn't. So how would I turn it on, I guess? Okay. Did you? Yeah. Okay. So it's in the searching section. So up at the top, do you see a search bar at the very top, sort of to the right of the screen? Okay. Click in there. Okay. Yep. Now, did that show any AI options there? No, that's a problem. That's, I don't see AI options. And you did not call tech support about this? No. Okay. All right. So you're going to want to start with tech support and make sure that, A, it's turned on. B, they'll be able to help you. You got to the sales line here. I'm in sales. And so you want to call that main number, and you want to hit option two when the voice recording starts. That'll get you to support. One gets you to sales. Two gets you to support. All right. All right. I'll call back in. Thanks. Okay. All right. Yep. Thank you. Bye-bye.",
