    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Conrad from On Point Search Group. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Good. So I was calling because it looks like I've been locked out of my account because of multiple attempts or whatever. So I was dealing with a technical issue with the integration with API, and I don't know if that's the reason. That's somebody trying to log in over and over. But, you know, nothing's changed on my end, the passwords or anything. So I just want to get it squared away. Yeah, no problem. Let me – it's the Conrad username? Yes. Or is it other ones? Okay. Yep, I see it's locked too many password attempts. Let me unlock that. Hit save. Okay, that should be unlocked for you. Let me know if that works. uh yeah looks like we're good so um okay i think that should do it i don't have to worry about any spams or anything going out in my name or anything like that right um no yeah i don't i don't think so um yeah no yeah if uh you do have like if somebody working on an api integration for you they may have tried a few things and got locked out so you should be good if it happens again let us know and we can investigate further, but I think you should be good. All right. Sounds good. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thanks. Have a good one.",
