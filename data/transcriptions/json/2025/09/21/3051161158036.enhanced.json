    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yes, hi. I wanted to see, for some reason I've lost your, when I go into LinkedIn, I used to have your little logo there that I could click and then capture somebody. And I don't know if Microsoft updated something and I lost it, but I wanted to get that back. Yeah, let's pop on a quick screen share so I can take a look here for you. What company are you with so I can get you pulled up? Brightleaf Group. Alright, what's a good email address for you? George, G-E-O-R-G-E, at Brightleaf Group, B-R-I-G-H-T-L-E-A-F, group, G-R-O-U-P, dot biz. Perfect. George at Brightleaf Group dot biz. All right. Just sent that meeting link on over to you. Okay. Okay. All right. Enter my name? Yep. Okay. and then if you see a pop-up about joining with camera or computer audio you can just exit out of it and then hit continue without audio microphones I don't need I can block that then you're saying and then Reject or cookie preference or allow all? You can do the allow all on that one. Okay. And then at the bottom of the meeting window, where you'll see a TT and a GG, you'll see a blue box that says share. Okay. For some reason, choose how to join the audio. Just exit out of that box. Okay, there we go. Okay, now we're there. Okay, now share, okay. Yep, and then you'll want to share your entire screen. So you'll see an option that says your entire screen and then a screen underneath it or two. You'll just click on which one you want to share, and then you'll hit share again in the bottom right of that pop-up box. Okay. Perfect. All righty. So let's go ahead and take a look. You can go ahead and minimize this window. Okay. All right. Let's go ahead and take a look where you were doing the LinkedIn. Let me see if I have it up here okay. LinkedIn. All right. Go ahead and click the verify it's you up at the top of your browser. Okay. So go ahead and put it, yep, go ahead and hit next. Okay. Then go ahead and enter your email password. I got to keep track of these different ones. Bear with me. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now you can go ahead and exit out of there, of this tab. Okay. all right go ahead and click on that G for me over on the right all right so that's good can now click those three dots to the right of that G and then go to where it says extensions it's about halfway down in that list go to manage extensions and then go ahead and scroll down a little bit for me okay so it's just turned off there so just there's a little toggle to the right yep and then you can just click exit out of this tab. Go ahead and click on the little capture extension for me. Click on the little capture extension up at the top of your screen for me. It's to the left of the little puzzle piece. Nope. Other side. Nope. Nope. Going the wrong way. There we go. Okay. Yep. Yep. Go ahead and click that for me. Okay. Go ahead and click it one more time. Okay. We're just going to have to uninstall and reinstall this real quick for you. So click that puzzle piece to the right again. Yep. Go to manage extensions. Go ahead and scroll down. And next to that, yep, go ahead and hit remove. Yep, and then remove. Then over on the left hand side of your screen, you're going to see where it says Chrome Web store bottom left okay yep right there and then type in PCR capture in that search capture with a P Oh Then go ahead and hit add to Chrome. Add extensions. Yep. Then click on the puzzle piece again for me. Am I at the puzzle? This is the right one here. Yep. And then click the little pin next to where it says PCR capture. Okay. Okay. Then go open up a new tab. Go to your PC Recruiter login page. Or you can just do it on this one. That's fine. You can click your PCR shortcut there. I'm not sure where I'm going now. Your third bookmark. So that way you can go to your tabs. Click the button that you normally go to log into PC Recruiter. Yep, right there. Go ahead and copy that URL up at the top. the whole duck just click here to no okay then at ww2 yep copy that click the capture extension again that little square next to the puzzle piece nope other side capture Nope, wrong way. Yep. Nope, not the star to the right. Right there. Go ahead and paste in that URL into that box. So it already has that in there. Can we take that, what it shows now, take that out? Yes. Yeah, that's just the placeholder. So go ahead and paste. It's trying to erase that one. Yeah, it won't. Yeah, there you go. Go ahead and hit Log In. Go ahead and put in your username, which is George. Then your password for PC Recruiter. Okay, I've got to look that up again. I'm not sure if that's the right... And then you'll select your database from the drop-down. It says database, you gotta click into there. Yeah, but no, it's not going through yet. Yeah, because you have to select the database first. Oh, okay. So click where it says default database, and then hit log in. Okay, incorrect. Well, just try hit log in now that you've selected the database. Yeah, I might have typed it wrong. Okay, so yeah, go ahead and try and enter the password there. I don't know if it, I guess it maybe matters if it's a capital. It does. The password is case sensitive. Okay, let me see this. Oh, sugar. It's not working either. So let's do this. Click the three dots up in the top right-hand corner of your browser again. go to Passwords and Autofill, go to Google Password Manager. I don't have it. I don't think I put it in Google. Well, you have ones for PCRecruiter.net down there, so let's take a look. Oh, okay. Yep, click into there. Go ahead and put in your computer password. When you log into your computer in the morning. Oh, okay. Go ahead and scroll down. And hit share? scroll down first we want to make sure we find the right password and scroll down one more just to make sure go ahead and look at that password okay just click a number after okay maybe we don't so okay so click the touch no so click the capture tool up at the top of your screen again one that's right by the puzzle piece yep right there go ahead and hit login put in George for your username go ahead and put in that password go ahead and select your database from the drop-down oops men hit login too quick I hit yeah let me make Let me just make sure you didn't lock yourself out here. Nope, you're not locked out. Could it be a different password that you have? No, I think I just hit it too quickly before I did the database, default database. So it should still log you in afterward if it's the correct password. Let me try the password again. I think that's the right password. It's what we got barred. Okay. There it goes. All right. Go ahead and click the little X. Okay. Go ahead and go to LinkedIn. Go ahead and go to a profile. Go ahead and just hit the refresh button real quick. Which button is that? Over on the far left, it'll be that little circle arrow. Yep. Then you'll see that clip. Yep. Okay. It doesn't look like it's filling that in, but... Well, so that was saying that you might have that company on there already. Yep. Yeah, okay. Yep, you should be good to go now. Yep, very good. Thanks for the help. Not a problem. You have a great rest of your day. You too. Talk to you later. Bye. Bye-bye.",
