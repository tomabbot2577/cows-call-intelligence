    "text": " Hey Robin. Hey. So, did you, so do you know about the tax thing? I was trying to figure out these bills. I'm so freaking annoyed with Integrity today. Yeah. Really freaking annoyed. What did they do? Because they keep, I think she has somebody going in and applying these tax rates or whatever. and then I think they're going into like an open invoice whatever adjusting and saying oh yeah update recurring so it's screwing up like if we already did the user adjustment I'm really freaking annoyed with them right now yeah I think we need to have a meeting with Kathy because I'm like this needs to I just wrote earlier like this needs to stop like whoever's going in and doing this they've screwed everything up like probatest we already dropped them down to three they got billed for five again um because i think they went into an invoice and then updated like stop messing with the recurring go and apply the tax but don't change the users and then somebody else with that was on hold they went into the recurring and then whenever they saved it or whatever it enabled that so they're going to have that i literally done nothing else other than fix their damn mistakes this morning. And I'm still going through the emails. Like, I'm furious right now. Furious. And none of that makes sense, why they're adjusting that stuff. That's why we just need to have a meeting with her. I need to talk to her about like, why that's happening and what we should be doing. Well, I mean, I think I figured it out. I'm like, because apparently there might be like a lot audit trail. I think she has somebody else going in and, you know, because there are certain locations where you're supposed to be applying tax, like Chicago and then Ohio by county. And I think Patsy was not doing anything for Chicago. But there's, like, I Googled it. It's basically if you connect through a cloud thing, it's considered, I forget what the rule is, how to explain it. But basically if you're accessing something by a cloud, Chicago wants their tax paid. and but in Ohio it's not just Lake County tax it's where the person is so they had to go do that and then the other ones are just selecting out of state so when they're going in and changing all of these they're screwing things up so I pointed out is it possible if they went into an existing invoice that was open and fixed it that they're selecting because there's like no edit this one time or there's hitting like edit recurring that's an option i never do that i always do it separately you know what i mean i do just this invoice only and then i go in and if there's a change on the recurring i do that separate so i think they're hitting that edit recurring so if they were for example at five and we already have the recurring set to three because they dropped like you know between cycles well it's updating that recurring to five so now the only thing I can really do is let people know like let me know because I have no idea how to really go back and change all these I don't know what else was changed you know what I mean so right now I'm just being responsive it's just too many cooks in the kitchen I don't want everybody in here because I'm really wanting to point fingers at people and the less fingers I because I first thought I was going crazy I told Davisha I'm like I thought I was going crazy like I see notes that I did it and like I'm not stupid I know how to change the recurring you know then we finally figured out this and then now so like too many cooks in the kitchen I don't want five people in this billing system making changes yeah yeah because when I get an email like you know I'm wanting to I'm getting to the point and wanting to point fingers and at least now I can kind of point them all to integrity because I like literally have a document I did this I did this and and then it's changed again like another one like they went in and somehow change it to do a pound receipt when the person asked for 30 days I already had it changed I already have it noted and even in the quick like it's just really annoying so yes I'm a little crabby. So what they've been doing now is that they're giving a discount for sales tax if you're not in the locations that it should be charged. And because they didn't want everyone's pricing to go up, is that what it was? I don't really know. I think it was maybe more like a cleanup that because they didn't collect it, but they need to collect it going forward. but then why would it like right now it says what's what's the invoice what are we referring to which one 220-2528 let me look at that one i think it's just because they did not collect it before but they were supposed to okay but they need to be but they need to be it's Chicago I'll find it How did I find it before? Hold on one second. Basically if you're using an online service, if you're in Chicago. Does Chicago explain charging a customer in Chicago tax for online service? They have a name for it. Hold on. I probably looked it up. Yeah, it's something because the customers in Chicago that Chicago charges a tax if you're using an online service. I have to find my notes about it. I'm not finding them right now at the moment apparently. Non-necessary computer lease, which Chicago considers a type of taxable personal property lease. Accessing or using software remotely by a cloud-based system. Yeah, if you're in Chicago and accessing something like a cloud-based system, Chicago wants their money. Right. So we have to figure out why that was previously happening, why the discount was in there. if we need to adjust these invoices, we can't just adjust them. Like now WorldBridge is paying like an extra like 50 bucks for their invoice. So that's why I have her pause it because we needed to talk to them first. And I also needed to find out about the discount because the PPI went away. So that's fine. That's good. And then the portal licenses got fixed. So before it was only like $8 for the difference, which was not a big deal. But with the tax going in, because it wasn't before, they're now paying more. Right. But they're in Chicago. I mean, it's not our thing. It's something that apparently should have always been charged but never was. Yep, exactly. But we need to explain that first because if I remove users and then my invoice goes up, I'm obviously going to be confused about that. So instead of waiting for them to notice and then call us and be upset, we need to be proactive about it because WorldBridge is a big company. So that's why I had them pause it so we could fix it first. I had to generate the invoice because it was paused during our thing, and I don't want it, like, getting overlooked. So I've sent the invoice. It's out now. Yeah, no, no, no. It processed already. I talked to Deb about it, and I'm going to meet with Kathy about – I'll meet with her about the thing that you were talking about, but I also want to talk about this with her. because we need something either in writing or figure out. I think we need to be told that all this was going on. First of all, it was my big complaint. Right. Exactly. Which is why I will find out from her what the deal is, because it doesn't make sense from our end. And we need to know, because if we're adjusting this and customers are paying more because all of a sudden they're paying taxes. One, I need to know why they weren't before, if it was an error on our end or not, what that means. for us like is that something that we've been paying and it's been coming out of like profits if it's something we haven't been paying at all and that's why it's a mess and if we need to go through and find these people and adjust this billing we need to know so we can do that because should have been if it always should have been charged we need to at the very least do it moving forward and then find out what the which is i believe what they're doing but They're just kind of going in and making these changes, and I've never received any email, like, about it. Right. So it was probably communicated to somebody before, like, it was someone else. So that's why we need to discuss it. So I emailed her that I want to meet with her about it. I'll find out what she says. And I'll let you know when that's done. Okay. All right. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later on. Bye.",
