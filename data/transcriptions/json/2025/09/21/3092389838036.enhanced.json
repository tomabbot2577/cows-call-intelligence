    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, you are my go-to guy when I need help. Bob Levin, how are you? Good. How are you? Good. Quick question. I just exported a list from, you know, a roll-up list into Excel. And it gave me what I needed as far as the company name, number of employees. I deleted all the columns that I didn't need. But how do I get all the websites from that list into an Excel spreadsheet? Oh, OK. When you export, it's going to export whatever columns are visible in your roll up. So if you've customized your role. Let me go back into PCR with you. So I am right now. Well, actually, you know what? We always do this together. So can we do a quick screen share? Sure. Okay, so I'm RingCentral. And hang on, let me go to video and go into join. And whenever you're ready. Perfect. The meeting ID is 057-468-005. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Now you see me. And you want to disconnect from the phone?",
