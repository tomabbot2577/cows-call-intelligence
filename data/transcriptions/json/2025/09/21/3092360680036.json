    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I hope I'm in the right place. I'm trying to get some technical support on PCR. Yeah, what's going on? Okay, so I have clearly messed something up when it comes to, I guess, the basic search function, as well as when I'm in a company and I look at the names. It's sorting by the person's name instead of the last, let me see, the last activity. And I want it to sort by last activity for all of that. So when you're under the names tab of company records, it follows the same layout and settings you have set for your search results pages. Okay. So to edit those, go up to name up at the top, like you're doing a basic search. Uh-huh. And you should see a little gear icon. Yep. For that customize option. Okay, let me see. So that is, do I have to go into an individual name record or is it just I click name and basic? No, so it'll be name basic and then it'll be in that same top half. with the gear. Yep. And I see searching results page and recently viewed. Yes. So you'll go to results page. Okay. And that's where you can set what shows under that names tab. Ah, I see. Company record and there's the custom sort orders over on the right. Okay. So name results, custom sort. Okay. So I should do on custom sort one, the last activity. Yep. And then do I do, what is AFC and DESC? So ascending or descending. So descending being whoever has the most recent activity will be at the top. Okay. So definitely have descending on that. Okay, and then for custom sort too, I can just put in whatever I want for that. Or you could even just leave it blank if you really wanted to. You don't have to have both filled out. Okay, so let me make sure that that... Do I need to log out for those to take effect? No, as long as you just hit save, and then the next time you go to a company record. Well, it didn't do it. So I must have done something wrong. Yeah, what's your username in the database? It's Jill, J-I-L-L. Let me pop in and take a look here for you. And I don't have anything under search results fields. I'm not sure if that's creating the issue. It shouldn't. Because that just means you'll have the basic layout. Well, I'm wondering if it might, though. It might need that customization in there as well. Okay. Do you know what fields you want in there? That's just the three, because I have a view of the three different sections. Is that what I need to put in there? Yeah, so what you have, where you have their name, their company. Yeah, because it's like a tribe view, I guess. So I have a personal, professional, and then contact info. So I can do that. I can just add those things in. I think I know how to do that. So that's the name record view. In the search results, you can have certain fields pop up underneath that names tab. So like if you go to company and then name, where it has like their name, their company name, work phone. Right. You would set those in that same search results. section. Okay. Okay. So how do, so what do I need to do on that? Yep. So you'd go to name. So go back to basic search and do name. Yep. But then do I need, I need to know like exactly which fields I want in there. Right. Before we add those. Okay. So I need to do that. I'm just jotting these down so I can. Okay, so tell me where I go again, back to name for like a basic search, hit the gear. Then results page. Then under the search result field, you just do click the set field. And then you can start picking what fields you want. Okay. Now, it says predefined, but it's like a full name. So let me see. Name. Yeah, I think I can work through this. It'll take me probably a few minutes to do it, but I can work through this and figure this out. But if I have an issue, I can call you back. Perfect. Okay. I appreciate it. Not a problem. You have a great day. You too. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",
