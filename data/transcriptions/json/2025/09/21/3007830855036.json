I am just calling because I keep – I'm sending out emails, and I just got that update your email alias. Okay. your SMTP. And I went in and I thought I did that, but it's still not working. All right. Is it anybody you email or just one particular person? Because sometimes like a mistake in the email address, like let's say it's main sequence net instead of .net, that could also throw that same error. This was the first one that happened too. Hold on. Let me see if I can send it to my partner who's with me right now. Okay. Okay. So it says it's sent to him. Did you get an email from me? Just now? Yeah. Okay. so it could be do you remember who you were emailing when you got that oh there's a period at the end of this .org .org period could that be it okay yeah so basically what it was is your mail server was rejecting it because it was like not a valid format gotcha okay let me see if I fixed it I mean I could take a look at the email alias too which database do you go into is it the one called MedBest Recruiting or are you in one of the other ones MedBest Recruiting yeah okay which username do you go in as byocum it sent it that I took the dot off the back of the org and it did send okay yeah that's probably all it was was that one email address then okay okay awesome well thank you all right oh no problem yeah like never know it could be yeah if you already re-authenticated you did like to sign in with microsoft or sign in with google like if you're depending on who you're hosted by that usually would fix that so yeah i was just like oh what's going on yeah this is just that one all right well thank you i appreciate it You are welcome.
