    "text": " on technology. Jason, how can I help you? Hi. I was on vacation last week, and so when I got to my desktop today to sign into PCR, my Norton vault also must have logged me out, so I'm having a hard time logging into PCR because I don't know. I do not remember my password. Okay. Here, give me one second. What was your name? Brian Spaulding. Okay. Are you a single user? Is there anyone else who accesses the database? No, no. I have an admin account too, but that's just for me. Okay. Well, actually, I do my web developers, but they, or the guys that develop my website, but they shouldn't have accessed, I don't see why they would need to access it recently. Yeah, the reason I ask is because the easiest way to reset your password is having another admin level user log in and reset it for you. When we have users who need to reset their password, basically the process is I'm going to email you a form that does need to be printed out, signed, scanned, returned, because we're working with sensitive data, so we have to be really secure about it. So I can get that form sent over to you, and once I get that back, I can reset your password. Okay, yeah, great. I'll have you send it to my Gmail account, since it's in my Gmail, so I can access it. Okay, here, give me one second. Sure. is it uh brian s32977 at gmail that's correct okay let me get this sent over to you okay um yeah i'll get this form sent over to you uh just print it out fill it out um sign it scan it send it back once that's done I can reset your password for you and I'll let you know what I reset the password to so that you can change it okay sounds good I'm you should be able to take care of it right now okay awesome okay I'll wait for that thanks bye",
