Glenn Gardner, I don't know why he's got his panties all up in a bunch, but Gardner Innovation serves partners. He got an invoice sent to him at like 5 in the morning and then it looks like another one was sent for the same invoice at 1152 now the one difference I notice it says new invoice and then due today so I'm thinking I have something messed up in the settings I'm not really sure why he would get to so I'm gonna I'll text this or I'm sorry email this over to you but have a feeling maybe there's something wrong that is still selected maybe it's this print later I don't know but I will message you the details and if you can help us figure out why so we can calm them down thanks bye Thank you.
