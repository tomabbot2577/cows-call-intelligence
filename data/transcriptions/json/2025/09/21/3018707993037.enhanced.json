    "text": " Thank you for calling META Engineering and Technical Services. For the dial by name directory, press 9. For the operator... Thank you for calling Michael McClain. Please hold while I try to connect you. . . . AI is taking notes. Hello, Mike? Yeah, hello? Yeah, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. Hey, Jim, how you doing? I am well. Your AI lady answered first before you could even speak. She interrupted and said, AI is taking notes. It's taking notes, yes. Yes, through our Ring Central, we have AI notating. Can you hear me okay, Nick? Real well, real well. I sometimes am a little quiet at first, just with this headset. Well, I went to put my earbud in, but it's not seeming to connect. So all good, all good. Yeah, well, I wanted to follow up on... Go ahead. Can you hear it? Okay. Yeah, I hear you. So I got your email earlier this week and kind of wanted to circle back about the AI. And I understand you had some interest in PCRM. So kind of wanted to talk and answer questions, see what you were thinking you wanted to do, and help get that moved forward. Yeah, yeah. I see Nick sent a voicemail yesterday, I don't know, 4 or 4.30. I haven't got a chance to get back to him today yet to talk about that PCRM. Yeah. But I was working with Garrett earlier last week and earlier this week with that AI stuff. So they were supposed to, I haven't heard anything yet, but they were supposed to upgrade all our databases to the Lucene. Okay. And they were going to enable the AI search feature for all the databases. But they said that was a trial thing. and then yeah just to reach out to you to get some costing and details of timelines and all that so yeah for sure for sure and yeah so that that AI search they didn't put it in everyone by default because they needed to be Lucene do they see are some of your databases Lucene I would have thought some of them would have been I don't know I got back to Garrett he said he was going to reach out to the tech team and let them know. And there was a little bit, he said there was a little bit of issue with users not able to use certain functions while the new database was indexing or Lucene was indexing. So I had asked them if they could try to do the changes like at night or over a weekend or something like that so that it indexes and we don't have any issues with our users. Yeah. If they kick that off, it'll like as soon as they kick it off the keyword search doesn't work and then it'll slowly as it re-indexes it'll work you'll have more and more data and the pool of searchable data will grow as that goes so it's not that anything doesn't work okay yeah okay when you're doing a search like if you do a search right as it started it's going to kind of be searching on the re-indexed new pool of data so it's small and then it's going to increase as it goes so it might take a little okay i misunderstood okay i thought it was we were completely we wouldn't be able to have certain search features until it completely indexed. So as we've seen indexes, it, okay, okay, I got this. Yeah, and your search would look a little bit different once it's done. It's still going to work the same, but it has a nicer display. It allows for searching of attachments, so it gives you some additional options there. Okay. So I'll check with him and see kind of where things stand on that. If you were looking to, so the AI is included and rolled into the PCRM package. So if you went with the PCRM, it includes the AI. And what that's going to do, how it works now is we would create a whole separate link for all of your databases. So you'd actually have a PCRM link. You would still have that, but you'd also have the piece or you'd still have a PCR9 link, but you'd also have a PCRM link. So you could actually have people using the same database from both versions because it's not a conversion or an overwrite or anything like that. So it's kind of neat. It just gives you the PCRM so everyone could use it or they could still hunt back into 9 if they felt they needed to. Now is 9 something that you guys are going to continue to keep and upgrade and apply all the features and stuff to? Or eventually will 9 be faded out and PCRM will be taken over? Well, as of right now, 9 is, there's no end of life even forecasted. And many of the updates that they're putting in, they're putting in both versions. So nothing at all. Now, that's not to say that five, six, seven years down the road, we find that most people have migrated on their own over to PCRM, that they might eventually end of life it, but there's no plans to do that right now. Okay. Okay. So to do it, what would be the cost to do it? There's a setup of 350, and that is the one-time setup that create the PCRM link, and that also includes four hours training. So four hours training on the new piece. That would also include the AI. So the AI would be there. And the AI also works in 9-2. So that's going to work in both capacities there. So $3.51 time, and then it's an additional $10 per user per month for everyone so that everyone can access it. And you have to do all users. We can't just pick and choose some users and some not because it adds different things and it changes things in the database, and everyone's got an access point to it, even if they don't use it. So $10 more per user per month. So it looks like I think you're at $70. So it puts you at $80. So it would be at $80. It's still great. Like its list is $150 to $125. So you're still pretty good. So it would be a $350 one-time setup fee and then the $10 monthly per user to have that. Okay. Now, Jim, I guess, is PCRM, is that the same as we were beta testing for PCR10, or have they changed it completely from that? No, it's pretty much the same. Just a new name? Just a new name, because what they decided, it was originally conceived as a new interface and a replacement for PCR9. But over the couple of years that it was in development, they added so much. They added that sales pipeline. They added the simple sequencing. So they added some more CRME type features and they also found that so many people still liked PCR 9 that though many didn't and wanted a new interface, many, many did. So they decided to launch it as kind of a separate product instead of a replacement, thus changing it from PCR 10 to PCR M. So it's still going to look pretty much the same as what you were betaing. There might be some newer things because I don't know what server they had you on or anything like that. Have you seen the deals pipeline? Have you worked in that? You know, it's been a little bit since I've been on the beta of the PCR 10. I don't play in PCR day-to-day like some of our employees do. So it's been a little while since I've been in it. No, I haven't been playing on any of the pipelines or anything like that. So I'm sure there is some new features since I've been in there. Yeah, it's going to be basically what you were trialing, but there's some new stuff and some stuff that has been added and changed a little bit, but it's the same basic idea of what you were looking at. Okay, okay. So if we wanted to move forward with all that... Okay, so the PCR9, once the AI is enabled in that, how long is that trial period today? They're doing it for the summer. So end of August-ish is when they're going to turn it on. End of August? Okay. So then once that comes, they're just going to turn all the AI features off in PCR9, and we won't be able to... Unless you bought it, yeah. Unless you buy it. and then they would keep it. Okay, so I guess that's what I'm... So if we purchase the PCRM, it's the additional $10, but it includes AI on both PCR9 and PCRM? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes. Okay. Because the way the PCRM, it kind of includes AI. It's built into it. The same way that all the premium features in PCR9, like the analytics, sequencing, stuff like that, that is actually built into PCRM. So you can't have PCRM without all those features. Thus, if you get PCRM, they come with it. But you could have PCR9 with only the premium or you could add AI to PCR9. If you did that, no setup, but it's five bucks per user per month. If you elected not to go with PCRM at all, but you only wanted your AI on PCR9, that's five bucks per month per user to add just the AI, but no setup. So what's the real benefit of going with the PCRM then? Because we still have access to the PCR9 that has a lot of the features of PCRM. Yeah, well, the biggest... Yeah, what's the biggest thing? Biggest benefit is going to be, A, the deals pipeline. If you were looking to track potential deals, you wanted a sales funnel. That is something that is unique to PCRM. Okay, sorry, so it's deals and what is it called? deals and sales? It's like a sales funnel. It's called the deals pipeline, but some people use it like a deals funnel is what it is. So it's almost like your interview pipeline, but for deals, not for positions. So like our account managers and stuff like that can track deals or potential sales with customers. Is that the idea of that? Yeah, you can create a different deal and that creates a little card for that deal and you can drag it through different steps like contract sent discovery call you can make it warm hot cool you can give it a confidence ratio how close you think it is to closing and then the next step that we're releasing in a couple of months is there's going to be some analytics reporting on those deals so you could do okay I have to make it stuff like that so that all around that deals tracking is a benefit to PCRM Plus, there's a simpler sequencing model. So if you wanted to build a sequence, you can now do it right on the fly out of a roll-up list in about a minute. You can say, I want it to be an email, this email, go out, next step, call, go, enable. So it's a little quicker than our traditional sequencing, which is still in there as well, but it's a little bit simpler of a sequencing model. So that's in there too. And then another big benefit, some people like just the look and feel, the loading in the screens from the right, the full screen view, the ability to do a little more pinning, the ability to set up your little workspace there on each record and then have the details, which is all the fields. You can instantly search those. So just some people like the way it works and looks better. Okay. Okay. Well, Jim, would you be able to – is there any information on the PCRM or a comparison between the two? that so we have a in-house pcr pro what we call our pcr pro um sheila and i'd really like her to have a look at some of this information and um i do think it makes sense for for some especially for the low additional cost like the so you're going to do the for the five bucks for the ai for the nine but then for 10 bucks per user you get the whole additional database with all these additional features AI on both databases yeah I think I I'd like to bring it up to her and see what when she thinks about it and present it to our senior management makes yes what it makes sense for me to show you and her a demo of kind of what it is now kind of concentrating on here's the different unique parts here's what it's got we can kind of do a screen share and show you you around if that might work. Yeah, let me see what her schedule is like. Can you shoot me a couple times that would work for you and I'll see what her schedule is like and maybe we can just have a quick little... I will email you some availability over tomorrow or next week and then I'll also include the PCR sales website, which is the PCRM website, which has some information on it. That might be helpful too. And then let me know about We'll take that demo and we'll kind of take it from there. Okay. And yeah, if the PCR, if that website has a little bit of information, because she did have access to the PCR10 beta. She still does. But yeah, so it's very similar, like you said, to that. So we could get in and yeah. Okay. If you could shoot me a couple of times of availability, I will talk with her and I'll get back to you. And yeah. And will you, or do you want me to look into what's going on with the Lucene upgrade, or is that something that's easier to just do on your end? I'll talk to Garrett and see what's going on, see when they're doing it and everything, and see what he's kind of come up with. Okay, sounds good, sounds good. Yeah, and Garrett's been a great help with it all. Yeah, he's great, he's fantastic. Now, what about Nick? Does Nick, Nick left a voicemail about the PCRM. Should I be getting back to him, or are you kind of taking over for both of all that? You certainly could. Okay. I don't really know why Nick even reached out, because he works in the support team and kind of is a bit of a coordinator for some of the trainers. So he really doesn't do sales or upgrades. Okay. But it could have just been that maybe Garrett said, hey, here's what's going on. He was calling to fill you in or something like that. He did let me know you spoke and said, hey, if you want to call him too, because he knows that that's my primary function here. So let me know, because this is usually something I would work with. But you can certainly talk to Nick. He's just my support team. Okay, and I think, yeah, Garrett did, I don't know if he CC'd you on the email, but he did let me know in the email about reaching out to you for that. I think why Nick was reaching out is because I was dealing with him with the PCR10 beta, and you set up with some of that, So I talked to Garrett about going to PCRM. So maybe Nick was just reaching out about the beta. So I'll still touch base with him then. We did the beta. Yeah, James and Nick were kind of spearheading the beta when we were doing a 10 beta. So it might have been that since you were on the beta, you weren't coming in cold. So he kind of maybe sent you that way to talk about that. But like Nick looped me in too, because now that we are selling PCRM, we're all like, like I'm working with it too. Right, right. That might have been because he was working on Peveley with the beta version. Well, then you know what? I'm just going to shoot Nick an email and let him know I talked to you, and if there's anything additional that he could reach out to me. But other than that, then I'll just wait for you to figure out what we're doing. Because he let me know that he called you, and he's like, if you want to call too. And I said, oh, I have an email from him earlier this week. I owe him a call anyway. Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. All right. Well, Jim, I appreciate the call. I will look for your email. I'll talk to Sheila. I'll get back to you and we'll go from there. Fantastic. I'll send it over in a little bit and we'll talk soon. All right, sir. Take care. You too. Okay. Bye.",
