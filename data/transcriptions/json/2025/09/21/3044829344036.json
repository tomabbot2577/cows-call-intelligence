    "text": " Thank you for calling Namesignus Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett, Tim here. How's it going? Good. How are you doing? Good. Whenever I add somebody on the capture tool now, it does not give me the option to add them to our roll-up. Okay. We'll just put that into what's called your capture layout. So if you pull up a name and click on the click to add button that appears, let me know when you're that far. At the top right of the capture page there, it'll have a little edit button. It's like a pen on a notebook icon. Uh-huh. Click on that. This will allow you to edit your layout. and what we want to do is click on the words add group at the top related to the name record and there's an option in there to add to roll up that will add that group into your layout and just go down and hit save at the bottom right and that'll save your layout and then as you capture the person now you should be able to see as you scroll down an option to pick a roll up to add the person to. Did that appear for you during the capture process? I'm working on it now. Okay. It's there now? Awesome. Okay, thank you, sir. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Will do. Bye-bye. Thanks.",
