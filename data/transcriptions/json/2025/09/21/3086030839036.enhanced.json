    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. May I help you? Hey, Garrett. Does Robin still work for you guys? Yes. I wonder if she's just off today. I emailed her early this morning. I didn't hear her. Usually she's very timely, so it doesn't matter. I don't need to talk to her. She was the last person I talked to. This is Bryant from JCL Services. Oh, okay. I have a question because of all of the hoopla with... I even got an email this morning about Microsoft, you know, and that Windows 10 going, you know, no more support in October. And so, computer does allow me to upgrade because it's new enough. Is there any issue with PCR if I did upgrade to 11? No. Yeah, we're compatible with Windows 11. Are you utilizing, it's called the PCR Outlook portal, the add-in for Outlook? Yes. Okay. So the Outlook portal is only compatible with Outlook Classic. So if any upgrading on your system moves you automatically over to Outlook New, you just want to make sure that you continue to open Outlook Classic instead so that you can utilize it. I think that's all I use is Classic. How do I know? I'm pretty sure I'm on the Classic. Is there a way of knowing if I have classic? Yeah. So even after you update, you can do this where you go to the search bar at the bottom of your screen, kind of by the Windows logo, and just type in Outlook. And it will give you results that say Outlook and then classic in parentheses next to it. And then it'll also say Outlook new in parentheses next to it if you have that version. and you just want to click on the classic one to continue to open that one and utilize that. I just use the app. I don't know. Yeah, it's the Outlook classic app, exactly. Okay, all right. Once you – Yeah, that's what I do. I don't – Yeah. Good. And what's your take? And, again, what is your take as far as upgrading? I've heard some really horror stories, and it's like, is it really worth it? And, you know, it's like, I don't know. I just want to make sure that if I do it, it's the right thing to do. In general for the Windows upgrades, I think, let's see, I think I'm on Windows 11 on this computer. I haven't seen anything crazy that, you know, hindered my workflow. I mean, my general idea with updates is you don't want to be the first person to hit update so that they have time to work out some bugs. and Windows 11's been around for a while, so I think it's a smoother experience now, probably, than the people who jumped right over. And it doesn't take that long to do the update? I'm not sure exactly. I never really took an older computer and updated it. I just kind of had Windows 11 on this one particularly. It might take a while, maybe probably not a full hour, but it's probably a little bit of a wait to get your full system updated from Windows 10 to Windows 11. Yeah. Okay. But, yeah, just make sure after you do update that you still can use your little search bar at the bottom to find Outlook Classic application. You might see another search result there called Outlook New. Just don't open that one because PCR is not compatible with that one. So that's really the only thing is Outlook Classic you have to use. Right. Otherwise, yeah, PCR is totally fine on Windows 11. Okay. All right. Well, I do appreciate your time. Thank you so much for answering my question. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Thank you. Thanks.",
