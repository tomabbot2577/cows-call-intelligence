    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, this is Jim. Hey Jim, how are you? I am well, how are you? I'm good. I'm good. Sorry that I'm a little late. I needed to install Zoom, but we've done it, I guess. No problem at all. No problem at all. Glad we could connect. So I wanted to kind of just learn a little bit about what you're looking for, what you're using now, what your needs are, and I can show you around as well. Cool, cool, cool. I can't see you, Jim, by the way. Is that... Oh, you know what? You don't need to, but I'll turn it on. I usually don't have my camera on. I just keep it off. I'm usually looking down, taking notes, or showing the screen or whatever, so I don't usually have it on. But I have nothing on. No worries. For sure. So the reason I reached out to you is to give you a little bit of background. I'm from CV Transformer. So we're not a recruitment agency, but we are an AI software tool which we integrate with ATS systems. What we do is we automate CV formatting. And I thought I said that when I reached out. So we're currently integrated with Greenhouse JobAdder 720 and we're working on some more integrations. And I was just curious to see who your clients are and not necessarily names, but are they like recruitment agencies or are they a different type of agencies and is there some synergy in which we might be able to collaborate with partnership integration whatsoever okay for sure for sure yeah so we uh we have about about 2,000 customers using PC recruiter the majority of them are going to be recruiting agencies both temp and perm retained kind of all sorts also some corporations doing internal recruiting as well but to a lesser extent those so nice okay that is great and are you guys and is it all custom build or are you build like on sales force for example or something else I know we are totally custom-built so we have been around since the late 90s custom-built program we kind of do all of our own updates our our own software builds it's quite configurable to the user so they can customize the screens, add different fields, do a lot of configuration in the system there. But yeah, we are our own system. We do all development in-house here. Nice, nice, nice. Sounds good. Because did you know that I was calling from CV Transformer trying to talk about an integration or did you think that I was a recruitment agency trying to use your software? I didn't know. I assume you were an agency, but this happens oftentimes, people calling in to talk about integrations or anything like that. So it happens. Okay, okay, okay, good, good. I'll roll either way. But, yeah, so is it something that you write the integration? I don't know if it would be something we'd be open to. I do have a different person who kind of works with our integrations who might be good to put you in touch with. I guess that might be the best way then. Because as I said, we've started last year, we currently work with 150 agencies, basically mainly in Europe, but we're currently starting to grow in Australia and in the US as well. And as I said, we just integrated with Greenhouse and JobBeta, so I guess we will expand via them as well. I mean, you've got 2000 agencies, so that would be a great opportunity as well. Do you currently offer some sort of software or solution for CV formatting in your tool? Not really, not really. So we don't have anything like that. Within PC Recruiter, we can parse the resumes in. And users can kind of edit them, reconfigure them, store multiple copies. But we don't have anything that would AI reformat or anything like that. We have a small AI suite, primarily content generation. So if you go to a candidate summary, you can hit a button. It'll pull the information from their resume and from their various different fields and generate a custom summary. So that's one thing we do. That's probably the closest we have to it, but we don't have any kind of automatic resume editing or anything like that. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Because obviously, like, that is from our perspective. We talk to a lot of agencies who are looking for a formatter. I can imagine that's also like a niche. but it could be interesting. What is the right thing to do? Would you mind if I share my screen and show you what we've got? Is it easiest if I talk to your colleague? Yeah. Well, I can take a quick look but I will also kind of see if you have any information you can send me. I'll share with my colleague James and kind of have him take a look and see if that is something. He kind of works heavily with the development team. He knows what we're working on, what we integrate with. He knows all the points about that as well. Nice, sounds good. What I will do, I will share my screen. Okay, let me see if I can make you the host, so it should ask you momentarily if you want to share your screen. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it. How was it looking? Like, how do I do it? Let's see. Share my screen. I want to show everything. Share. Oh, I think I need to... All right, I've given the permission now to Zoom. I think I need to close Zoom and open it again. I'll be back in 10 seconds. Is that okay? Okay, for sure, for sure. Cool. Let me see. All right, there we are again. You're back, all right. I will send you a request for sharing the screen. I just hit allow, so that should... Yes, there we go. Okay, very well. I guess you're on the screen right now, yeah? all right let me put this somewhere here all right so what we have made is a very simple formatting tool which is simple to the user but on the background it's not that simple but that is how it should be i guess not for sure um so what we have done i think there are two important things to show you so for every one of our clients we create a custom build cv layout one or multiple if they need multiple we always build them from scratch and then eventually something will come out like this whatever so we've got all sorts of options with a cover page with a cv section you can add attachments if you want to um and every cv layout comes with a custom data scheme as well so you're not tied into limited options in terms of just experience education whatever um but you can use every bit of data basically because our ai will understand which data you want and which data you don't want to pull from the original cv obviously most recruiters they don't want the contact details etc of the candidate on their formatted cv yeah so how it is you create a new candidate and then on the right hand side you will see your cv layout and on the left hand side you get the opportunity to upload a candidate cv basically um and then obviously we support dodge english but we support every language So you just tell our tool, all right, fill in our values. And what it will do, it will drag all the information from the candidate CV onto your CV layout. And then it's up to the recruiter to basically fine tune the CV. So if you want to, you can add an image. Obviously, all the data is adjustable. So you can just change everything if you want to. Good thing, I guess, data that it can't find, for example, in this case, the availability or the agreed salary, it won't make up any information, so it will only pull the information that it can find. So in the end result, you will see also that they won't show as empty boxes unless you say 1st of July or whenever. And it will show. Two more things I guess that are good. In terms of lists and then a list of work experience or a list of education or whatever, if you missed some information or you simply want to add some information, you can very easily just create a new item, drag it to the right position. If you want to delete an item, you can very easily delete an item if it's not relevant. And the last thing we have is our AI box here in the left bottom corner. And this is basically like you're talking to chat GPT or whichever AI model you use. So you can say write introduction about Mark Williams based on his CV and explain why you should. You see recruiter. Let's see what it says. so this is what it will do it will in this case generate an introduction but with that way you can fine tune and optimize your CV basically and now you're done you can download it as a PDF and your CV is ready to send out so basically in 2-3 minutes you can format a candidate CV into an on-brand CV and you're ready to go so that's what we do excellent that's something we don't we don't do and I on occasion and asked for someone they want to know do you have a means by which we can throw a standard format on resumes and we don't do that so we don't have any way to do that it would be all manual so that is something we don't do so that's a good piece and then being able to save a PDF we could even take that and then attach that formatted resume as a second resume into our existing system so that is something that we can do. Yeah. That's exactly how we do it within Salesforce. So quite often, candidate records, they have the original CV and the formatted CV. So you have two or three CVs in there. For sure. Excellent. So I think that is good. So let me, yeah, if you have anything you can send over to me, I'll share it with James, kind of let him know we spoke, let him know what it is and how it works and have him reach out to see if that's something we're interested in or see if that would fit our roadmap. Yeah. Cool, cool, cool, sounds good I'll share some information with you Yeah, let's just go from there Perfect, sounds good Alright, well send that over And then I will share, James Blair is his name In case you get a reach out from him Okay, thank you very much I'll send him a LinkedIn request as well Fantastic, alright, thank you Alright, thank you very much Take care, bye-bye Bye-bye. Goodbye.",
