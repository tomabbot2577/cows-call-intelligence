    "text": " Good afternoon, Mr. Chip. Jim, it's Roger Hendricks here. I've been trying to catch up with you. Yeah, Roger, I just listened to your voicemails, actually, and I was getting ready to call you. Okay. The question was, I'm just officially retired. I canceled my website domain and everything, but a client firm of mine wanted to know if they could, you know, purchase my data or my candidate data, but it sounds like they have to also be a PC recruiter customer. Is that true? They don't have to be. It's easier if they are because then we can just pluck it off your database and put it on theirs. But if they're not, what we'll do is I'll put in a ticket to close the account and we'll request the data return. What we can do is we'll give you the ability to download an SQL database backup of that data, you can then take it and do whatever you want with it. So you could put it on a drive and send it to them, sell it to them, whatever you do with it is up to you. But you could do that, just get a data return. That way it'll be in a SQL format and just about any product they could use can handle SQL data. Okay. Okay, that sounds good. So that is possible. Yeah. So what I'll do, I'll put in the ticket to get everything closed because you're closing the account? Yes. Okay. And then there's a $175 charge for the data return because our guys need to pull it and make it available and securely put it on a link for download. So I'll make you aware of that. There's also a form you'll have to fill out. Okay. But I'll have my team send over the needed form to get that underway. And then also from there, get everything closed out. And then And my accounting team will let you know if there's anything else you need to know. No, just the email. The Roger at RAH Financial is going away. So it's my rallen55 at yahoo.com. That's the email to use. Okay. Do I have that one? Let me see. I don't know. That's always been my backup. Let me get back in here and see if I do. Okay. Yeah, I have your age financial. Let's go and look in emails and see if I have another one here. Okay. I don't have it. I don't have it. So what is that? What is it? rallen55 at Yahoo? Yeah, it's R-A-L-L-A-N 55 at Yahoo.com. Perfect. Okay, I'll start using that email from here just since the other one's going away, and I will go ahead and put that ticket in. And you'll then hear from either Nick or Robin with the needed form and the invoice for the data backup and everything, and then we can get everything closed up for you. Looking to close immediately this month? Yes. Okay. Very well. Very well. And not going to anything else. You're retiring and just getting out of the business. Yes, getting out of the business. But a company offered to purchase, you know, I've recruited for them for about 20 years. And rather than just throwing everything away, you know, I thought, well, I might kind of sell it. I don't even know what to ask for all the day. I've been doing this for 30 years. so I don't know if you guys have ever heard a rule of thumb about transferable costs I haven't I haven't heard of any even approximations there okay well that's good I will go ahead and put that ticket and get the process underway you should hear from them I'm going to hope today but maybe not today I don't know what else they've got going on but as quickly as they can I'll get in touch thank you sir bye bye Bye.",
