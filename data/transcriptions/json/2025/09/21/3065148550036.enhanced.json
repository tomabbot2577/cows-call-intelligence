    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Heather Schmiegel. I am having an issue with PCR. Yesterday I had to – I'm having some memory issues with my computer overall. So I cleared out caches and all that kind of stuff. So I've been trying to email, and it keeps telling me to go to system, email, set up, email, alias, list. So I did that, and it says the connection is fine, but it's still not working. Okay. I'll take a look. Which database are you in? Like PCR or what do you mean? So when you're on your login page. Yeah, there's one called MedVest Office, MedVest Recruiting. MedVest Recruiting. Okay, perfect. And what is your username for PCR? H. Schmiegel H-S-Z-M-I-G-I-E-L Okay Alright So I called our IT company We were messing around with it Trying to get it to work And we thought we had it fixed And then it didn't So I might have changed some things So correct whatever I did wrong Gotcha Okay, yes So we do need a reply to address on here. I'll update that. You're sending email at a blank reply to address. So I'll just copy and paste your from address there. Perfect. I think that helps at all. Check one other spot. Okay. and then what I can do is maybe I'll just create a quick name record for myself and try to email myself and see if there's any error messages that I can't decipher there am I going to need to log out and log back in to get the up I'm assuming you're correcting it on your end of my account um possibly you You might not need to though, we'll see. Okay. Let me just test this here. Here we go. Okay, there's a name record for me. Let me just email myself from your username. PCR support test. Outgoing. Okay, that one looks like it went through. Let me check my inbox here. Yep, I got that immediately. Okay, so it does look like it is sending out. Maybe it was just that reply to address needed updating. Do you want to do any tests? No, I just tried to send what I was sending and it's the same thing. name record are you sending an email to? Who am I sending the email to? Yeah. I'm sending it to five people, my typical five people that I send it. I'm trying to send an invoice submission, and it's through a placement, through a template. Okay. Try, let's see. Yeah, you might want to try maybe logging out of PCR and logging back in and see if that helps. That is a good troubleshooting step. All right, let me try that. And that's best recruiting. I'm under that database, so that's correct, right? I'm not, I had to, yeah, like I said, I kind of wiped my computer when I did the, cleared everything. Sony doesn't get into this. Excuse me. You know, I'm just going to submit to Tyler. And Matt. All right, let me just make a change here. If this doesn't work, we might have to jump on the screen and share something. So we did it this time. Now, hold on a second. Here, let me do this again. Hang on. I have all the information to be able to do this very quickly. Because it seems like when I fill out this whole form is when I have an issue. I just made like one little quick. All right, let me just do this real quick. Yeah, no worries. Amen. Amen. All right, let me try to send this, see if it works. Nope. See, as soon as I fill it, you know what? That is crazy. As soon as I fill out this form and add those multiple people, I get that message. Okay, let me do a screen share and take a look at what you're seeing. So if you want to just open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings.ringcentral.com. You said RingCentral? Yeah, meetings.ringcentral.com. All right. All right. Join the meeting. Yeah, let me know when you need the meeting ID. Yep, I'm ready for it. That is 910-641-105. 910-641-105. All right. Perfect. Awesome. And then if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. I'll just keep my phone muted. Okay, perfect. And then go to the blue button down at the bottom that says share and select your entire screen up at the top. All right, perfect. That's loading. Good. I can see that. All right. Let's jump back over to your PCR screen. Everything is, like, blocked. Get in there. Hit cancel on that. Okay. Okay. So it's this. So now I was able, I sent, like, a fake one to T. Blanton, and it was just him. And it went through. When I add these people and actually fill out the form appropriately, I keep getting this. Okay. And are these email addresses that you are hand typing in or are you selecting them from somewhere? I just copy and paste them from Google. But those are the correct email addresses. I bet you if you take off these four people and I send it to T. Blinn, it'll probably go through. Try closing that pop-up box and just remove one email address. Just choose any one. Try hitting send now. Okay, close that. go ahead and re-enter the one that you took off the NDE Jesus remove a different one maybe the DGlen one hit send let's re-add DGlen and then try removing Jay Rapensky. Hit send. Okay, so the Jay Rapensky one might be misspelled or have an extra space in it or missing a period. So let's see. Is there a Jay Rapensky name record? Yeah, it's Julie. She's the owner. Okay. Oh, yes. Okay, yeah. So I'm going to try to copy and... Copy. Hold on for that. So it did send out to all those other people already, but... Yeah. Yeah, that email address. So let me check a setting in your database. It might be that she is a private email or something. Let's see if that even exists as one of your options in your database. Okay, she's not listening. So I wonder if it's her. Possibly. What's the person's first name? Julie. Julie. Julie. Okay. Thanks. Yes. And she's the owner. So she, I would assume her name is like the main thing. I would think. So there is not a name record for Julie in the database. Let me see if there's something on like the email opt out list or something. Okay. Yeah, I'm not finding her in like your email opt-out list in your database or private email. So I'm not sure, but that does seem to be the one that's given a problem. Let's do one more test here on this screen. If you want to take off T. Blanton and leave everybody else, it might be – I'm wondering if you are sending to too many people at once. No, I guess that wouldn't make sense because we were able to send to – Let me, yeah, let me, let me just do these people and see if it sends. No, it's hers. If you take off all the other email addresses. I send to those many people on a regular basis. It just started. Okay. If you take off all the other email addresses and just leave Jay Rupensky, Let's see if it'll send that. All right. No? Yeah. Oh, you know what? I am seeing a period after the word come. I think that's what the issue is. I don't know how it put that in there. Let's see. Yeah, there you go. There it is. Let me see. I bet you that's exactly what it was. And. And. Here we go. Nice. Yep. It was just the extra period. Awesome. Let's see. Anything else you've been having trouble with emailing out or anything in PCR? No, that was it. That was it. And I guess it all had to do with that period. I don't know why it added that period, but anyways, it fixed it. So we're good. All right. I did notice that your incoming email is not connected, meaning there aren't activities being written when you receive an email into PCR. The connection needs to be reestablished. Is that something that you usually have turned on? Okay. So go to the – I don't really know. Okay. We'll just connect it. Usually people do like to have that on. Yeah, click that gear icon and select email. Okay. And we'll go to configure at the top left. Go to mail servers. And then in the bottom frame, you see that little action drop down to edit the Heather Gmail server. So if you just want to click on sign in with Google, it should connect you to the right account. Continue and continue. Okay, go ahead and hit test connection at the bottom. Okay, you're connected again. Awesome. Go ahead and close that. test and hit save. Excellent. Okay. Yeah. I just wanted to get that reconnected for you. So your received email, your incoming mail would write activities. All right. Perfect. Awesome. Awesome. All right. Well, thanks for cleaning everything up. I totally appreciate it. Happy to help. Yeah. Reach out if you notice anything else you're having trouble with. We're happy to help over here. Thank you. I appreciate it. Have a good one. You too. Bye.",
