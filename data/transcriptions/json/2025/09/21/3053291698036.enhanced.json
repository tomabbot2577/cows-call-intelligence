    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Rowan. How are you? Hello. Hello. Hello. How are you? Sorry about that. Hey, we have an issue. I'm trying to update, like, I don't have a load of main records, and we're trying to update the company, like, the company name for those records, and they're not updating. Okay. Okay, so with the update, the company won't move them to a company unless you also have city, state, or like the phone number mapped. And the reason is some databases have multiple companies with the same name, so it has to have more criteria to know that it would be moving it to the right record. No, we only have, like, we have the name of the company specified. It's unique in the database. Yeah, it won't move the person to a different company unless there's more about the company mapped. I mean, I already tested giving the company like serious data and a phone number and it still wasn't updated anyways. And I'm sorry, what is your name? Jose. And your last name? Garcia. And what is your company? Recruiter Back Office. Okay. So when you did your mapping, like if you're doing a name import, did you do pound company name, pound company city, pound company state, or pound company phone number? I didn't do the pound. I just mapped them with the field. Yeah. So when you're in the name mapping screen, there's like four that are really yeah I'm not them to those fields like I create the like the colors for the upload and I map them to the company phone company state company city okay yeah that should do it like it seems to work on some of them but not all of them and another reason why What database are you working in? After Partners. Okay. And what username should I use? Admin. Okay. And what roll-up list were you using? Was it the one called Laterals 814? Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's see what kind of stuff it's been doing here. stuff that's been doing here. Do you have an example of somebody that you know did not update? Like what their company name is in PCR right now versus, and then I'll ask you what was in the file. I have well I'm pitching her manually after that but I have Joshua Baringer They're in Jackson Walker, but we want Jackson Walker LLB as the actual name. Let me see if I can find Jackson Walker. Let's see. What did you say his name was? Jackson Walker, W-A-L-K-E-R? The name of the person is Joshua Baringer. Baringer, oh, okay. Sorry, let me go back over there. There it is, Joshua Geringer. Let's see. And he should be in what company? In Jackson Walker LLC. Okay, that's where I see him. Oh, I see there's just Jackson Walker. Yeah. I tried to give the company I want to move it to the CD state and phone number that's the VNL. And I've tried a couple of variations of that, but it doesn't work. Not sure what this is. So far, the only thing that allows me to change them with the name wizard, if I set them to like the default company, if there's a default company, they change. That's a restriction, only fits in the default. Let me find the company Jackson Walker. I might need to confirm if they will only do that if they were in the default. Yes, I'm confirming. Yeah, because I'm wondering if there's, because it could maybe affect the relationship in other areas. Because you do have a Jackson Walker LLP in the database that has 135 people in it. But Joshua Barrington is not one of them. And then you have Jackson Walker here. You have Joshua in the other one. The other thing I wonder too is both of these companies don't have any data in those fields. If you want you can add some data in there. I tried adding the data but it didn't change anything so I ended up just deleting it while try other things but if you want you can try it. Are these two companies really should be merged? I can ask if you want to merge them. Would we need to do that because the name is similar? If you know like Jackson and Jackson Walker LLP are really the same company you can merge those two so that way all the names are under the one company yeah but it's not only if they are Jackson Walker if they were in another company I cannot move them anyways it is just like that yeah I'll probably have to do a little testing on my side. to be honest. Let's see. Yeah, that's a little bit. Yeah, I'll have to probably do a test. What I'll do is I'll create a ticket and I'll just need a time to do some like test scenarios and then get back to you. Would that be okay? Yeah, that's okay. Okay. All right. I'm going to create that ticket now. Okay. Okay, the ticket is very generic. I know what I mean by it. But just you see the description, but it's assigned to myself anyway. So what I'll do is I'm going to, I have a couple calls back to do, but then I should have a good block of time where I can focus on this. And I'll run through and see what I find and confirm with our developers to make sure that the intended design all right okay like if I cannot attend the call could you also just write to a couple of emails yeah so you'll notice you're probably getting an email right now you say at rbo.team. Oh yeah, I think I got it. Can you also link to that Johan at rbo.team? other team? It would be J-O-H-A-N. Do I have him already? J-O-H-A-N. Oh, I don't have that name. Okay. Let me make a name record for that person. He said the first name is J-O-H-A-N. And what is the last name? And this is somebody with your organization, right? Yes. Yes. He's like the other IT guy. Okay. Martinez. Martinez. Okay. And what is his email address? Johan at RBO. Okay. Okay, so I have to put his name over to... I have to export this record over to our help desk. Let's see, export to freshdesk. I might have to do it on the replies. Let's see. That will probably do it. Okay. All right. All right, so I got a little note here to include on him on the next reply that'll get him into the ticket because the ticket really only has like one main person. So okay, sound good. And I will let you know what I find out. All right. All right. We'll be back from you soon. Okay, thank you so much. Bye. Bye bye.",
