    "text": " Good afternoon. This is Jen. Hey, Jen. My name is Jennifer Nicholson. I'm returning your call. I'm with Southeast Mortgage. Yeah, yeah. I got an email that you were looking to support and your account opened up maybe? Not looking to open the account. Well, unless that means grabbing our database. I just need access to the database. Okay. So are you looking to get it to take with you or are you looking to open it up and utilize it in PC Recruiter? No, I'm opening. I'd like to take it with me. Okay, so you just need a data return. Yeah. And I don't really have even a link. Might it have been under something other than Southeast Mortgage? Unless it was under the name Kim Thompson. It should have been under Southeast Mortgage of Georgia, but it might have been under Kim Thompson. oh okay i see it it was under just southeast mortgage okay that was okay yeah so that is something it looks like the account is still active what it looks like looks like it's still active i don't know if it's being logged into or not but it still shows this paid current i think southeast mortgage in lawrenceville georgia well we're now in duluth georgia but Okay. Yeah, I see that it looks – to be active, it looks like I have Kathy Geis-Selinick as the main signer and responsible party. Okay. So Kim and Kathy have both retired. I am their recruiter and HR coordinator here for Southeast Mortgage now. How can I gain access to that? Well, what we would need to do is we'd need to – is it possible to get some sort of a sign-off from one or either of them? They're both retired. Okay, so no active there. No. Maybe if I could get something designating you that you're going to be the main responsible party to be able to request a data return from Southeast Mortgage on Southeast Mortgage letterhead or something of that nature. And then we could get a data return which would essentially give you a backup of the entire database. And then it was SQL format, so you could take it anywhere you needed to take it. That would probably be the best bet. Okay, so you'll need a letter on letterhead that states what? That you are authorized to get a backup of the Southeast Mortgage Database. It may be signed by the director of recruiting, director of HR, one of the officers of the company, or something of that nature, somebody with authority there who has a provable title and everything like that. and then we could get a data return made available to you. We'd need a form filled out as well. So if you have an email, I can send you over that form, or maybe I can wait until after we see the name of the signer or whatever. Okay. If you want to send it to HR, it's going to go to my boss, who is actually a vice president for the company, and she's the director of HR, so she's going to be the one signing the authorization. So if you want to send it to HR at southeastmortgage.com, she will get it. Okay, perfect. I will send that over. And then there's also a cost of $175 to get that return. Even when we're active? Oh, yeah. You just said we were active. You are, even if you were active. If you were inactive, I probably couldn't even get it because the database would have been shut down and archived. So it's good that you're active, but maybe you don't need to be. So that might be another conversation to have to see if you might be able to turn it off and not bill it at one user anymore. Okay. But I will go ahead and fill it over. Do you know how much we're being billed for that? Looks like $110 a month for one user, one seat. And after we get this data return, I'll cross that bridge when we get to it. We can figure out where to go from there, because it doesn't sound like you need it, and it doesn't sound like you need to be paying for it, so we can talk about getting it closed down after that. Yeah. Okay. Okay, that would be great. I'll get that on company letterhead, and you've shot that information over. I will send it over in just a minute to HR at? SoutheastMortgage.com. Yep, I got it. Okay. All righty. Thank you. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. All righty. Bye-bye.",
