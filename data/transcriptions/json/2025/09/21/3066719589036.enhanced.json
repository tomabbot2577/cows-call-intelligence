    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Scott Shapiro. Good morning. Hey, how's it going? Good. I got a question. I am in one of my employees' roll-ups. Can you look? So we're looking at the same thing? Sure. At MRI Charlotte. All right. And which username are you logged in under? Kay Sullivan okay I'll just jump over to roll up a right so I'm in the roll-ups right and then hold on so I'm in the roll-up so under username I unchecked everybody because I just want to see it would just be the role that she would create now when I unselect the names I'm seeing all these role bliss in here that I mean they weren't created by her these were created by previous employees what so why am I seeing this because I really should be seeing nothing because she hasn't created any roll-up list yet. Okay, so the username filter at the top will show you any username that has created a roll-up list. So the Kay Sullivan username is not up there. So it doesn't look like Kay Sullivan has created any roll-ups that have. Right. Right, okay, and then the roll-ups that the previous employees have created stay in there even after you delete the, or, you know, disable the... Oh, so because she hasn't... Right, so as soon as she creates her first roll-up list, that's going to be the first one at the top. As soon as she creates her first roll-up list, she would want to use that username filter at the top and select her own username if she just wants to see her own roll-up. Right, but because she hasn't created any roll-up lists, that's why under the username, there's nothing there. Exactly. Right, okay. So to create the first roll-up list, right, so let's just – to create one, it's – so the – You can click the plus sign at the top right of this roll-up list screen in the action menu. Oh, that's – yeah. And just name it whatever you need to name it for the test and hit save. Right. And, okay, so let's call it – that's what – Okay. Okay, so call it Ohio Valley RSM, and then hit save. Okay. Okay. There it is. Okay. Yep. Excellent. Right, because she created the first one. Okay. That's awesome. Okay. Thank you very much. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. That's it. Thank you.",
