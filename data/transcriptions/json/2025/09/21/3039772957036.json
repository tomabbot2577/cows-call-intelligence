    "text": " Thanks for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi Robin, this is Eric Miller out of Indianapolis with Centerline Solutions. How are you? I'm good, how are you doing? Good. You sent me an email today about my account and I just wanted to give you a call and a little bit of a concern panic to make sure you don't shut me off because I wasn't aware there's an issue. Let me pull up your stuff here. hold on one okay let me make sure sorry i was like in the middle of one i just want to make sure i don't mess it up because everything's done okay on hold uh oh it'll be right next to me that talk to her give me one second if i don't do something then no worries and then okay Okay. All right. So it's center line, right? Yes. Okay. Okay. All right. So it's centerline, right? Yes. Okay. Yeah, what concerns me is I changed my email address like two years ago, but you always bill me every month, and you've always been billing me, so I guess I'm not sure. Yeah. Okay. So we did change our billing system, so that could be where you might have received the invoices, which are sent to, it looks like. looks like they go to emailer at mricsi.com. Yeah, I haven't had that active for like two years or something. Okay, let me see what was in like the old recurring template. Like trying to switch from one to another. Yeah, I can give you the new address and all that, but you guys auto billed me forever, and I guess that's what, have you stopped doing that? Well, in the old system, it was processed like a sales receipt, not like really an invoice on auto pay. It was kind of a back-ass way to do it, to be honest, because I guess at least a while back they didn't offer auto pay. So it was a way to do it, but it was like really manual where you had to like – the card sailed or whatever. You had to like do all these things. Okay. This is just much more automated. So the problem is we had to set you up as an invoice, and you had to put in your card details at least the first time. So let's do this first. Let's update your address, your email address. I'm sorry. Okay. It's emiller at centerlinesearch.com. E-Miller as in Eric Miller. E-Miller. Okay. Let's see. E-Miller. So that part's the same at centerlinesearch.com? Yes. Centerlinesearch.com. Yeah, because I always just log on. Like my PCR, I just have a link on my desktop, and I've been doing it. I don't think I've actually logged on to it in forever, so I'm not even sure what it is. So they're in exchange with my old email address. I hope I can still log on. So I was going to go try to log on to that portal, but I'm like, I better call first just to make sure. Well, the portal is, what do you call it? it's not even associated with your PCR credentials or anything like PCR, because some people that do the invoices aren't even Peace Recruiter users. Okay. All right. So right now, the last invoice that processed in the old system was, we had an April one. Okay. It was processed in May. so you really have your May, June and July so there's three of them that are open so I can fix that the best thing for me to do is to log on to this unless you want to give it to me now and we just do it over the phone, it's up to you it doesn't matter, it's easy enough for me I can just give you my credit card now and we can just do it that way what is the name on the card? Centerline Solutions. Okay, Centerline Solutions. And the card number? 4246-3152. Okay. 5618. Okay. 6469. Okay. And it's 1228 expiration. And the security number? 751. Okay. And what is the address associated with the card? 4,000 West 106th Street. Street 125249. Okay, so that hasn't changed. What's the zip code? 46032. Okay, let me add this in. And it's still Carmel, Indiana, I assume, right? Yes. Okay. I know we want to get a shut off PCR email. That was scary. I'd be surprised how many people just kind of. They don't care. I think that that's okay. They just stop and, you know, you're under contract. What's the point of having contracts if we're just going to ignore them, right? Well, I'm about most people. I'm in it every day. so I'm like, I can't not use it. Right. Okay, so let me just fix this. I was sure there was a digit missing on your – Oh, try again. Hold on one second here. It's 4246. There it goes. Okay. I said update your zip code. Okay. On here. Okay, got all that updated. Recurring, recurring. Just making sure all this is nice and cleaned up. Okay. All right. so let's turn it on let me turn on auto pay for you so do you want me to go ahead actually let me see in case anybody's got a late charge one of them did so I'm going to take that off well thank you okay so I'm going to take that off so there's three invoices each one is 145 81 okay appreciate it all right here let's see I want to make sure it syncs over okay good all right so this when I do when I process it it should as well also automatically email you a receipt so you should be getting that in a moment now at emailer at centerline search.com okay perfect you are all set thank you for giving me a call absolutely that was easy you made it easy I appreciate that no problem All right. Well, you're all set then. Have a good week. All right. Cool. All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye.",
