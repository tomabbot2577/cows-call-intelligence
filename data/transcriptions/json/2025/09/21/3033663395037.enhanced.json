    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Mike McLean with META Engineering. How's it going today? Good. How are you doing? Good, buddy. Good. I'm just following up from yesterday. Did you get any details about the Lucene upgrade there for the databases? Yes. Let me check here. um so they waited until the evening to do the loose scene upgrade um so i'm just waiting this morning uh in confirmation that it is complete uh from the tech team so yeah it was kicked off overnight oh last night okay um so i know um sorry jim jim was saying that so as it indexes So this morning we shouldn't have any issues with search. Like it should have indexed everything throughout the night. So everything should be populating is my question, I guess. Yeah. Most likely. I haven't had a confirmation from the tech team that the index completed. Okay. But they did kick it off. Let's see. I have a note that they started at 15 hours ago. So most likely it is complete. For the most part. Yeah. Yeah. Now, is there something that has to be enabled for the search feature to be that trial? Or once it's updated to Lucene, do they automatically have access to that? There is one more step. Once the Lucene index completes, then they turn on the AI search. So as soon as the tech team lets me know that the first part's complete, I'll double check with them that they're turning on AI search. Awesome. No worries. We just had some of the team in today, so I thought I'd let them know. But, yeah, keep me updated. Just shoot me an email if you get any confirmation that it's completed. Awesome. Yeah, and based on how everything's going, you'll probably be using AI Search today. You'll have it all in those four databases you mentioned. So, yeah, look out for an email from us when that's all complete. Awesome. Great. Thanks a lot, Garrett. Yeah, no problem. Reach out if you need anything else. All right, buddy. Thanks. Take care. Bye.",
