    "text": " Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah. Hi, Tyler. I'd be happy to work with you, but Garrett is familiar with my problem. I didn't know if he was available. He is on the other line right now. I've been actually helping Garrett with your having the capture issue, correct? yeah so he sent me an email and I just wanted to I'm kind of when I'm trying to follow it I'm getting these kind of intimidating messages and I was hoping you could walk me through it yeah with clearing your site data yes so you know he has me going so I'm on a LinkedIn profile and I went to that toggle. And so the options I have, connection is secure, pop-up and redress, automatic download. Redress site settings. Yes. Okay, I went there. And then he told me there's a, onto the right, there's like a whole thing, delete data. Yep. So when I click that, it says, you know, you'll be signed out of this site, including open tabs. Any offline will be deleted data that affects ad personalization is deleted. Yep. And then you just hit delete there. Okay. I did. And then you'd go back to the LinkedIn page. There. And it will have you sign in again. I did. And then you'll go ahead and go to a LinkedIn profile. And then once you get to the profile... Hold on, it's making me verify. It's making me verify. Check your LinkedIn app. We sent a notification to your sign-in devices. We know that you recently tried. I'm looking for the LinkedIn app. Sorry. No, not a problem. It should give you an option to send a text message there as well. Verify using SMS. Is that the option for text? Yep. Got it. Thank you for your help. Yep, not a problem. Okay, we're there. All right. So now go ahead and go to a LinkedIn profile and then refresh the page. Damn, didn't work. because when me and Garrett have been looking at this it's something with either your we think it has to do with your browser or maybe like settings you have in your browsers because we were able to log into your account yesterday and the capture tool worked completely fine on LinkedIn so there's something going on with your specific computer that's causing this I believe you what do I I mean how do I you know what kind of settings that's what we're trying to figure out okay I appreciate that what's interesting when I go to recruiter light you know then I could you know, I can, it allows me if I go to somebody it allows me to do that. Yeah. Which doesn't make a lot of sense. Well, that leads us to believe it's something like a setting you have with that specific site. That's why we tried clearing out those site settings. Should I reboot the system? Would that help? Yeah, you can give it a try. One thing I want you to do as well, click those dots at the top and go to view site settings. What I did before, you mean? Yep. Go to site settings. Yep. And then under delete data, you'll see it says reset permissions. Yes. Click on that. Hit that. Yep. The next time you visit LinkedIn, that will use default permissions. Yep, then use reset. And then go ahead and exit out of your LinkedIn tab. Okay. And then open up a new tab and go to LinkedIn. And then once you're on the new LinkedIn tab, go ahead and go to a profile. All right. I'm at a profile. Is it popping up on the side for you? No. Now, Garrett had mentioned that it worked for you part of the day yesterday. In the morning. How old is your computer? I'll tell you I have the receipt. It's a few years old. Now, when you're logged in on Chrome, are you logged in with your work email or a personal email? For LinkedIn, it's my work email. not LinkedIn for like the whole profile like your whole Chrome profile I think it uses my Gmail account my personal Gmail account if I'm answering your question yeah Just trying to think of what else. be causing it here Did you have time to hop on a quick screen share? Absolutely. I look, I appreciate your help. Trust me. Yeah, I think there's a few settings I want to check here. Ringcentral.com? Yeah, I'll just email you a link here. Oh, okay. well let me have appreciative of your help I absolutely have time it's not a problem right taken care of yeah I just emailed that link on over to you get here in just a second I got it just came now perfect do you want me to join no you don't continue without audio Yeah, I see you. All right. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of that meeting window. It says share. Share. Yep. And you'll want to share your screen. You got it. It's like you've done this a time or two. Yeah. All right. I think we're sharing now. Yep. So go ahead and click over the top right-hand corner of your browser. There's that little profile picture of you. Here? Nope, very top right corner. Oh, got it, here. Yep, go ahead and click that. And then go to manage your Google account. I don't know. Maybe I did something inadvertently because I hadn't had this problem. Go to where it says personal info over on the left. And then is that the top Gmail account? That's your personal one? Under content as well. Okay. Go ahead and click the three dots in the very top right-hand corner. Yes. And go to settings. Over on the left, go to where it says Performance. Go ahead and turn off the memory saver. And turn off the... Let me double check mine here. Okay. So I didn't have that turned on. All right. So go ahead and exit out of this tab. Leave memory turned off? Yep. Exit out of this tab. Go back to LinkedIn. in and refresh the page. Actually, let's try clearing our browser cache here first, now that we've made that change. Go to the three dots at the top right. Go to Delete Browsing Data. Go to Advanced. change the time range to all time. Oh, I see. Sorry. Yep. And then the only thing you want checked is cached images and files. Actually, check cookies and site data too. That seems pretty gummed up. Go ahead and hit delete data. So we'll let this do its thing. I'll go ahead and go back to LinkedIn. Leave this up or get out? You can get out of it. That's fine. It looks like I lost you on the meeting there. Yeah, because LinkedIn kind of checked me out. All right. So, yeah, I'll just have you rejoin the meeting then. Let me just get my code in. Thank you. Okay, so how do I get you to, how do I rejoin? Just go to that email I sent you and click the link again. Perfect. And then you'll just share the screen again. Perfect. All right, let's go back over to LinkedIn. Refresh. Yep, go ahead and refresh the page. That's odd that it's doing something weird with dark mode. Can you just click on, like, another profile? Yeah. Over on the right-hand side there? Yeah, just any profile. Oh, I see. Then you just logged back into LinkedIn, correct? LinkedIn, right. Yes. Let me see if there's any LinkedIn settings or other browser settings. Can you click the capture tool up at the top for me? Go ahead and toggle LinkedIn on and off. That very first option in that list. Yep, and then turn it back on and then refresh the page. Yep, turn it back on and then refresh the page. All right, go ahead and click the puzzle piece up at the top. Go to manage extensions. In the capture tool, click where it says details. Go ahead and scroll down. Does allow access to your files, is it not, it's not on, is that a problem? No, mine's not turned on mine either. Can you click where it says site settings? That little pop out? Yep. Go ahead and scroll down a little bit for me. now is your work email gmail as well no no okay no it's uh hosted by go daddy gotcha okay you go ahead and exit out of the settings part right here Would it help to update? Yeah, go ahead and click that. It'll probably say it's already up to date. Go ahead and scroll up a little bit for me. Thank you. Go ahead and hit the back arrow. Go ahead and turn the capture tool off. And then back on. Is this a problem with the service worker? No. The service worker just lets us look at errors in the tool while it's running. But since yours isn't popping up, it doesn't really show us anything. and then go ahead and go back to LinkedIn and refresh the page do I have to have PC Recruiter running too? no Can you hit view and recruiter on that person? Yeah. You said it's popping up here, right? Yes. see yep do you do right we're gonna try one more thing here go to the three dots in the top right hand corner again in Chrome oh and Chrome here yep go to settings over on the left go to appearance That all looks good. you go to your theme for a second into where it says theme can you turn it to just either light mode or dark mode not have device checked go ahead and exit out of here. And then go back to LinkedIn. Refresh? No, go to the regular LinkedIn, not Recruiter. Yep, and then refresh. Ah, dang it. I was wondering if that theme maybe has something to do with it. Click the three dots for me one more time. Go to where it says Help down at the bottom. Then About Google Chrome. No, so Chrome did need an update. Relaunch? Yep. Yep, and then hit leave. It's going to knock us out of the meeting, but... Good. I'M GOING TO SIGN YOU BACK IN. YEP. DO YOU SEE MY SCREEN? YEP. Then go ahead and go back to LinkedIn and refresh here. Can you open a new tab and go to LinkedIn again? like start a fresh tab session. And then go ahead and go to a profile. stubborn little problem here yep I go back into your Chrome settings tab go to where it says privacy and security over on the left be towards the top go to where it says security that all looks good Thank you. Go ahead and go back to the LinkedIn page. Click the three dots in the top right hand corner. Go to where it says more tools. Then developer tools down at the bottom. and I go ahead and refresh this page again. Caption. Caption. I'm able to get Quick Match. yeah so on that quick batch parameters that like last line you'll see that blue script next to it go ahead and click that for me right here yep then go ahead and expand that out shit did i do something wrong oh god just open it back up click the maximize button on that on the Chrome browser again nope the maximize button up next to the X that square then go back to the LinkedIn page Go ahead and scroll up in that little box for me. go ahead and click the X in that little box up at the top. Here? Nope, over to the right. Here? Yep, yep, right there. Do me a favor. Highlight that person's name on the LinkedIn page. Okay. And then right-click on it. Go to PCR capture. Then capture as name. That worked. Then go ahead and exit out of the capture tool up at the top. Nope. Over on the right, like actually in the capture tool. Oh, here? Yep. Thank you. So that part's working. It's just when it's... And you and Garrett had tried this on... In Edge as well, correct? Yes. Okay. let's pull up edge real quick I just want to make sure there as well let's just go to LinkedIn Sign in. Yep. Nope. Go ahead and hit back, the back arrow. Or just click on your profile picture up top. Go ahead and scroll down. that's like an advertised LinkedIn yep log in yep alright let's go to a profile If I click the capture tool up at the top for me, you're logged in. This is odd. All right. So we have made quite a few changes right now with all this stuff. What I'm going to have you do, go ahead and do a full restart of your computer. Like actually do like shut down, leave it off for a minute, and then turn it back on. and then if it doesn't come back up, like if PC Capture is not showing up still, just send Garrett an email and that ticket, and we can look into it further. But this one is... Can you also remind me how to get the colors back to where it was before because it's too light? Yeah, so you'll do the three dots in the top right-hand corner of Chrome. Mm-hmm. You'll go to settings, and then you'll go to appearance over on the left. Then under theme, you'll click the little pop-out box and change it back to either dark or device. Got it. so my computer is not off should I want me to turn it back on or wait a little more just wait like 2-3 minutes and then if it doesn't come back up just message Garrett back on that ticket I actually have to hop off for another meeting here no problem I appreciate you trying everything yeah not a problem If it doesn't pop back up, we'll continue to troubleshoot further. Thank you. Yep. Have a good one. Bye.",
