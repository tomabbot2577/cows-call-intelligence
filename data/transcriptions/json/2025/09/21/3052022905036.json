    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I am calling to see if you can help me with this. I'm trying to look for a report that could get me some data about my placements. And I keep running into some weird stuff. And so I thought I'd give you guys a call, see if I could save some time. Yeah, not a problem. So what type of information were you looking for? Well, I'm trying to run a report. Is it like a report that you already have in the database? Oh, well, I thought I did, but then when I run it, all the fields are not populated. So I'm trying to find out if my custom fields are working. I mean, you know, to be honest with you, I haven't really had a successful placement report yet. and I'm really confused about why when I do run a placement report, it's like it's duplicating all of the candidates in the end report. Anyway, so I just would like to kind of see if placement reports are going to be an answer to what I need at all or if I'm going to really need to focus on making sure that I create custom fields in position. Position reports run really well, but I'm really trying to get to – I want to be able to run a report on all my placements, like ever made every single search. I mean, we only have 232 completed searches, so we're not really high volume. But I do want to be able to run that kind of report. I can run a roll up. I mean, I can do a search and I can populate a roll up. But what I'm trying to do is get a report done. So at the end of every search that's completed, once we filled it and we place someone, we can send a report to an individual report to our accounting person to let them know this person's been placed. You can go ahead and invoice. There's a few custom fields in our placement window that we want to, you know, we've worked out a deal where they're going to get a bonus. you know, this kind of, that kind of information. And it's just like, I'm just, the only way I've been able to make it work is by creating a custom position report, not a placement report. So. Yeah. Let me pop in here and take a look. Now, which, which one were you running most recently? The placement report. um well like i said i haven't run a placement report that i use at all i've been trying i've been playing around with them i've created you can see in there i've created like five different custom reports yeah but i'm like i said i'm just trying to get to a place where when a search is filled and a placement is made we have a an admin who just you know runs a it's a custom position report that she's running right now. And if you want to, if we can run one real quick, you can see the data that it spits out about that specific search. Okay. So to give you the most recent, let's just go to a position ID number 25266. Oh, I guess we're just doing a report. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Let me look at the position too. I'll have that open. Okay, so 25266. And then you go to the placement. Open that window. And then you'll see that we have, you know, some of our fields are going to be, you know, from, you know, you guys, they're, I'm trying to think of what they're called. Whatever, standard fields that KPCR designed. predefined there you go and then i've created some myself um over on the accounting side so we don't use pcr for our all our accounting purposes and when we do clickbooks and whatever but i want the recruiter to capture the information that they have and sometimes you know starting salary is kind of you know it's the recruiter knows what the starting salary is the recruiter knows, as you see here, $18,525 was a bonus that was added on. And so we kind of do the math. We have the recruiter do the math and just plug it in here. So total cash compensation is the starting salary plus the additional guarantee compensation. And then they're supposed to take that fee percentage, do the math, and plug in the whole placement fee is $66,168. so one day I'm sure that we'll streamline that we don't have to have them always do the math but for right now they're just they're plugging in the numbers the recruiter is so when they when they fill all this out then the goal is to have our admin be able to to run a report and the way that we're doing it now is she goes to reports she's running a position report it's a closing position it's a custom position closing position accounting report I want to make sure are you following? yep okay cool and then selected we're doing it from a roll-up so the roll-up is going to be let's see what is she using closing she's using a roll up called closing underscore POS underscore reports you'll see that there's only one position in there at this moment yep so let me take a look all right for it. Okay. So you're kind of looking for that same information in a placement report or different information? Well, it would be ideal. I guess to me, I may misunderstand what placement report is because when I do run a replacement report with this specific roll-up, you know, with this one position that we filled, it pulls up duplicates. I mean, we could try to run it if you want, but I, you know, it doesn't give this. This one is just the most successful. And so, if it has to be a position report, I'm fine with that. I just, again, I haven't had a successful placement report yet. And I just don't know what it is that we're doing on our side. Let me take a look at what this one looks like with that roll up. oh i see what's going on here it's like it lists every candidate that went through the pipeline maybe? I don't really know. And I'm like, okay, so, you know, in the custom report that I created to kind of capture all this data, I do notice that there's like, select the interview section, right? Select the interview. And so I'm looking at all the interview options, and I checkbox the accepted offer. But honestly, I'm not quite sure where we capture the accepted offer, accept offer interview, I don't think we're doing that at all with any of our placements. I don't think any of our placements are reaching an interview status of accepted offer. In our pipeline, we just move them on over into whatever, first interview, second interview, right over into placed. So there's custom report categories that could be messing with that in the pipeline setup. So let me try unchecking that real quick. Let's try selecting this roll up again. Yeah, for some reason it is duplicating all those. Let me, I want to say I've seen this before. And honestly, I've really been trying, because I make some leeway, I make some, I'm successful in some regards as it relates to building these custom reports. Or even just getting the ones that you all have created to work. and so I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out before I call you but I'm just honestly I'm like I can't every time with these placement reports I'm seeing multiple people and then even in one of the cases I saw when I ran one of my custom reports the same person over and over and over and over and over and I'm like okay why are they on this report entered in this report like eight times and so then I thought the only way that I imagined that happened was that it listed that person that many times because that's how many stages they went through, the pipeline that they went through. It could be the only explanation for it. Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Let me check. I want to say this is a known issue that might be up with our development team now. Let me double check here. And, you know, if that's the case, because we're really, you know, I've, my, you know, everybody's been pretty patient with me trying to, it's been a long process trying to get, move data from an Excel sheet over to PCR and capturing all this data over in PCR. And before I do, I mean, before I continue, I just want to make sure that the fields that I've created to capture that, that, you know, that data about, you know, starting salary, I think may be a predefined field. But essentially, what I want to do is make sure that if I'm going to run a position, you know, figure out from the start, is it a position or a placement report, that's going to be the best thing for me to do to capture the information. And then make sure that I create the custom fields, you know what I'm saying, for position or for placement, rather than, you know, create it for placement, and then find out I can't run a report or, you know, it's buggy or something. And then having to reenter all this data into the, you know, cause I could easily just create a tab and position and have the recruiter go in there and just put in all the data. You know what I'm saying? Into the position itself. And so, and then I can run a position report, right. And then just kind of bypass that placement. I mean, I take that back. We would place someone technically the way we still do, but we just wouldn't capture all the information and all the data in that placement window. We would do it over in the position so that the reporting can be done. And let me. I'm testing this on my end here, too, because it's a problem in my test database as well. I'll just put in a ticket for you for the placement reports. You know what, though? So I'm wondering if with the custom SQL reports, I know Robin had built some for me. And they are. And, you know, now that I'm looking at it, they're all placement reports. And it was probably because I was running into this problem before where I was wanting to capture a lot of data. And since the databases don't all I don't always know that they always talk to each other. she created three placement reports for me i don't know if you can see them custom sql reports and those work um and the placement the she did one placement by placement date um so i could run reports in a certain quarter or whatever based on like how many how many people we placed in the first half of the year some and then the second one is placements by position date just in case the bosses wanted to know, like for all the 2024 searches that we acquired, you know, all the data on those, you know what I'm saying? So it's by- That one by roll-up might actually work for you. The one by roll-up was, okay, so that, okay, let me click on that. Let's see. Oh, that would be exciting. Hold on, let me see. But again, these are, well, let's just do it. All right, let's see what happens. Closing. And I don't need to do a range. I just need to do a PDF. Oh, how exciting. Hold on. okay all right so it does it does capture like i said more of this information that i really really want which is how many days posts from you know opening to the start date post meant to place ah yes okay so this is this is what i want um but i do want to add some fields to this. And so can I do that from my end or does it have to be done from Yeldon? So there's typically a master SQL code. I did see that and she had that in there and I don't want to touch that. So would she just add to that? Yeah, you could always email Robin and just say, hey, there's just this report. I just need to add a few more fields and she could just add those in real quick. Okay. I think this is the one that we need, but yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to still open up a ticket so that we could, we could use, I mean, but I think this is what's going to help. Excuse me. I think this is what's going to work. Yeah. We had just done this so far back that I forgotten that we, we did this. it's one of those back burner projects that we that we keep I keep putting off and putting off and it's been a couple of years so yeah I would just email Robin with those fields that you need added and just make sure you say whether they're a placement field or position field okay be able to add them in pretty quick for you normally when you already have a report written like this, if it's just adding a few things, it's pretty quick and painless. Okay, cool. All right. Well, then I'm going to make sure that I know, and I think this through so she's not having to go back to it multiple times. And I request all the fields that I want to add to it. But this is perfect. this works. I guess one last thing. When I do pull it up, we do have race and gender fields in this report, and it's not populating them, or they're not populated, or the data's not filled out in the report. Are you able to tell me where she's pulling or what field she's using in this report? Those would be the EEOC fields. Okay. So there's an EEOC race and an EEOC gender field that you can have on your record. So like if you collect EEOC information? Yeah. I do. We do. Yes and no. We manually enter information in so we don't send them out and so we don't send out a questionnaire. Yeah, so that's where those are getting from though is the EEOC fields. These are the EEOC fields and am I able to manually enter data into the EEOC field? Yes. All you would need to do is add them to your layout like your name record layout. Oh, to the name record. I think what I may have done was added them to the placement window. But I still think, wouldn't they still work there? I'm looking at, so when I open up the placement. Let me check your custom fields, because it could be how it's coded in the report. Yeah, and those actually may be custom fields. Yep, they are. They're custom placement fields. So you're going to ask her to change those to the custom placement fields instead of the name EEOC fields. That's a quick fix. Okay. Awesome. Okay. And then those fields, they are placement fields, correct? Yes. The gender and POC? Yep, placement custom fields. Okay, perfect. All right. You've answered all my questions. Thank you so much. I'm glad that you understood what I was asking for. Not a problem. Like I said, I'll get that ticket put in here in a little bit just so they can look at it and fix it going forward. But I think this report will probably be, even when those are fixed, your best bet. Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Yep, no problem. You have a great day. All right. You too. Bye-bye.",
