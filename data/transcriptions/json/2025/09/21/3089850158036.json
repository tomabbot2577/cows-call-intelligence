Yes, sorry I was a little bit late. No worries, no worries happens to everyone. No problem at all. But yeah, so I wanted to kind of introduce myself and introduce PC Recruiter. We are the product that comes with Dimensional Search. And a little bit about us, and just a couple of questions. Are you in the October 6th class? Yes. Okay, excellent. Excellent. You're the second one I've talked to you today from that class. And is it just you? Are you going to have more than one user or just one for now? One for now. Okay perfect perfect perfect so what so what I do today usually with with PC Recruiter what I will usually do today is collect your company name and your address street address and such like that to email you over the paperwork for PC Recruiter it's simply going to outline the cost it is 750 set up and then $50 per month per user so you would have it yeah one user so 50 bucks a month when I sent over that paperwork that'll come in a panda doc so that'll come through it's just like DocuSign just a different name brand and once you find that I'll countersign it and then my accounting team would send over the invoice for the setup and first month so then okay once that's paid within a day or two you'll have a link emailed to you and that's going to be the URL that you'd go to to access your database it would be yeah you'd say that you're going to get a username and a password and then that would kind of trigger me to put in a ticket to get a trainer assigned to the account so what happens then once that trainer is assigned i will give you a call with that trainer they'll go over a couple of questions they have being dimensional search we kind of know you'll need ring central you'll need higher easy so we know the basics of what uh what you'll need but they have a few unique questions about like what do you use for email and just a few things and then that trainer is going to get uh probably two hours of training on the calendar before your October 6th training with dimensional search because they like you to have a couple hours ahead of time just so you're familiar you do some of the basic setup and stuff like that initially so then then you'll go to dimensional search do some training there then they'll hand you back over to our trainer and they kind of go hand in hand you essentially have two companies getting up and running and trained on the system which is nice okay now did you have any questions about pc recruiter or about the process or anything at all that I can answer for you. No, not really. I've seen it in a demo. Yeah, that's what we're going to go with. I understand CRM. So, yeah. What is your company name and your street address? Even though I'm going to email it to you, we need a street address to make the paperwork just to make sure you're not in Ohio so you don't have to pay sales tax. So what is your company name and street address? Okay. My company name is Mountaintop, all one word, search. And our address is 45954 Burns, B-U-R-N-S, Drive, Valley Lee, Maryland, 20692. And is it Valley L-E-I-G-H? no L-E-E L-E-E oh okay Belly Lee Maryland okay and let me just make sure I have an email for you I think I do let's see I've got your gmail is that the best email um let's go with my company email okay and what is that which is k period gail g-a-h-l at mountaintop search dot com dot com.

Let me know if you have any questions on that or anything. And then when it's signed, I'll keep an eye out. I'll countersign. And then we'll get things progressing here.
