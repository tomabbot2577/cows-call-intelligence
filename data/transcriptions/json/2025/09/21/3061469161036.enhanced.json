    "text": " Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just... You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hey, Jim. Good morning, Dean. How are you? Great. How are you? I'm well. I'm well. Yeah, thanks for joining me today. I understand you want to look around the PCRM product a little bit. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Yep. All right. And have you seen it? Have you heard about it? Have you taken a look at all? Or is this your first time? Are we on camera? Not on camera. Okay, not on camera. I don't remember. No, that's okay. Don't worry. I don't remember. Yeah. Well, let me show you around a little bit. So I don't know how much you've heard about the PCRM. What it originally was was slated to be, it was going to be a redesign for PCR nine. So it was going to be nine became 10 and they were going to push everybody over And what happened is they were working on it for so long and they added kind of some extra CRM features. So they decided early this year, maybe April ish to roll it out as its own separate product. but that it would share the same database as PC Recruiter. So it's called PCRM because it is a CRM. So that's where we arrived at the PCRM name for it. So what it is, it is something that you can add and use alongside the current PC Recruiter because it shares the same database real time. It's going to give you everything PCR9 has, but it's going to give you a new format for all of that, and it's going to add simpler sequencing, some easier data entry. it's going to add a whole sales pipeline for forecasting if that is something of interest to you so that's kind of some of the big things that it will add as you look through there so I'll kind of show you around just so you can kind of get a flavor of what it looks like and how it's going to work okay do you see my screen all right yep fantastic fantastic so as I get logged in I'm going to log into my database here let's see and I'm going to be logged into the system it's going to pop right up with the dashboard the my pcr screen there uh you'll see it's got different kind of different looking widgets uh so you can have like recently modified recently viewed you can hop up in your little pencil up here there's a host of different things you can throw a video in there some text instructions am i we already have this i'm confused like it's already accessible no it is accessible i don't think you have it though because it is something you would have to upgrade to add essentially Okay. So it's something that is available should you wish to add it, and it could be added to your existing database so that you could have people logging on via this link instead of your current link. So you see kind of what we've done. Rather than top and bottom, those frames that we have right now, we've put the menu on the left side of the screen. So you're going to see a lot of similar buttons, names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. A lot of those are going to be the exact same terminology but they're going to look quite different for example if I go into my names the name menu is going to look totally different it's now going to keep the most recently viewed records it's going to be a little bit longer of a scroll a little bit few more than we used to offer and you're going to have some things like the ability to edit in line the ability to perform an action right from the main list here you can send an email call text with ring central even gives you different numbers if you had multiples it'll kind of let you pick which one you could add an activity at a note put them on a roll up so you can do a little bit more from the front screen here you're also going to have a simple search at the top so if I wanted to look up Jim Lombardo I could just type in Jim and it's going to add these little green chips as I go through here and add different search strings different search criteria then I can X them out drag them in a different order do some different things there it's still going to support the same boolean search logic it's still going to give you kind of a ranking of the best matches, still going to highlight the words it found. So that's all going to remain unchanged. But a big thing we've done is redesign how this looks and how this works. So if I click on a record, rather than sharing the screen, it's going to slide in from the right-hand side of the screen, kind of go right over. It's going to default to halfway, but you're going to full screen it here, and you have your configurable record within PC Recruiter. A lot of these are the same terminology, like activities, resumes, positions, attachments, all the same terminology, but the screens have been redesigned and refreshed. We've also added a workspace and what that workspace does, that gives you the ability to design a custom screen right here that's going to let you put only what you want to see kind of by default. Maybe it's the resume, a few fields, and the activities. So that's up to you. And then the details, it's going to be every field you have on this person. Sorry, I think that we're looking at, I'm trying to look at something really different. I'm trying to look at it from a CRM system okay from a revenue management okay let me show you that so the biggest piece of that I was just kind of showing you how it differs and how it looks differently but the business I guess maybe um maybe just explain to me is this an upgrade or this is like a new push, sorry, take me from the start again. Well, what it is, it's a new product, essentially. It's a new product. So it is something that you could add to your existing account right now. And you could have everybody move over to this, PCRM, or you could have half of the people use PCRM and half still use 9. So it's not a replacement or an upgrade for 9. It's a different complimentary product which adds some things like this workflow and forecasting sales funnel stuff like that got it okay so this is kind of the big piece that was added the CRM functionality here this deals pipeline so what we've done is we've taken kind of the interview pipeline very similar to this but we've put in different steps that you might be having on a deal so so these are company records you can put in here you can actually add each one you can give it maybe some tasks that you want to follow you can check those off as they're done and then it has some things like temperature is it hot warm cool cold confidence level that it did that you're going to get this deal you can put in a potential value potential close date so you can put some different elements in here then you can also kind of put step probabilities under each step so that's going to kind of help with the forecasting all of the actual reporting for forecasting and reporting on the deals pipeline is due out in the next month or so it's not out yet so there is going to be reporting but I don't have anything right now to show but this process can be used you can put your different companies in here you're going to be able to then drag and drop them maybe I sent a contract to melt melt and logistics I can drag and drop them to that step that's going to move on through we're also working on a DocuSign integration so you're going to be able to send agreements on a PC recruiter with a DocuSign integration and then when the candidate or the one the company signs on, it's going to be fed directly in the PC Recruiter. So that's in works for release as well. But essentially, we've added just this pipeline, just like a sales pipeline. It's going to let you kind of put your companies in here, track them through a process. You can look at filter it by owner, by creation date, by deal name. So you can kind of zero in on it. This is what I want to see. Yeah. So is this addition or is this included in our current program? Additional, additional. So this would be an additional $10 per user per month and a $3.50 setup gets you four hours training and it creates this whole new link to the same database. Oh, we're not going to pay $10 per user per use, especially because it's not up and running yet. Show me then the master. This is an individual view or is this management view? this is management view the reporting is going to be different but like I said it's not out yet so there's going to be reports that would be more showing everybody's deals and I think everybody you can see everybody's deals or you can look at only your deals so I don't know if that's going to be locked down or not so how long until this is live well this piece is live the reporting I don't know I'd have to check and see what how they're working on that the reporting of the DocuSign. Got it. Okay. Keep showing it to me. Let's see. Yeah. So this is the view that the individual recruiters or salespeople would be able to use looking at what's going on with their deals. Their manager is going to be very similar to this. I think there's going to be more management reporting available there. And the other piece to that, We simplified the sequencing so that if you had someone going through and they were looking to start a sequence, the sequencing in PC Recruiter right now is a little bit difficult to use because you have to set it up and test it, make sure it's going to work and everything like that. Here, I can go right into a roll-up list, build a simple sequence straight away. So I can go through here and I can say I want an email, automatic, pick my details about that, pick my form letter. Then I might add another step. maybe it's a second email, maybe it's a phone call, I can go through. So I can actually build a sequence much quicker than I would. And when I build it, I can hit save all, hit activate, and start it straight away. So under a minute, I can actually start a sequence. If I wanted to mass communicate, send out to a marketing list, something like that, I can kick off a sequence much quicker. And then when I have my sequence running on a roll-up list, I can go through, and I can look at, let's see, I can look at the simple sequence. So you're going to have a column here that's going to show what step they're at, kind of where they're at, what step they are in that sequence. So that's going to kind of replace the roll-up list stages so you can track that too. So we've made the sequencing easier to use for marketing purposes. So those are really, by and large, the biggest things that changed to make it a CRM. The deals workflow, the simpler sequencing, and then the upcoming, which I'll find out when it's due, the upcoming reporting, forecasting, and DocuSign integration there. Okay. It is something that it doesn't need to be 10 with your number of users. I could probably do it for like five per user per month, maybe a hair less if you needed to do it. And once you decided, it would just apply a new link to access the same database. So there's no conversion. There's no – it's just as soon as it's created, you're logged in real time. You've got all the data there. You can use your existing company records to build deals into the deals pipeline from there. Nice. Okay. And is that this individual view, or is that – like, show me one more time the view of it. The view of the deals pipeline? Yep. Yeah, this is going to be the default. And I think it's going to default to your username. So it's going to default to your username, unless you wanted to look at other owners. You can pick multiple other owners if you wanted to include everybody's. So you can kind of pick them through there. But the default is only yours. Got it. And then as you do, move it through. Did the person move it through this or what? Yeah, a simple drag and drop. So maybe like melt inside, we can move them to closed one. so I can kind of just drag and drop that much like a candidate pipeline, just drag them through one step to the next. So once you create the deal, it's merely a drag and drop of the card through the process as you go. I think you can even next step it from here perhaps. I don't know if they added it that way. No, so you just drag and drop. That's what you do. Yep. Yep. Okay. Okay. So I guess, again, it's drag and drop, but go through this with – click on needs assessment. Click on the needs assessment, the VP of product. The VP of product. Okay. Yep. So I'm going to click on there. Let's see. There we go. And then I can enter to add. Do you manually have to change it, like each step of the way? Yeah. Okay. Other than if you move it, like you can set the step probability. So if you know someone in this step is a 75% probability, I believe that can be preset so that when you drag and drop them over there, that probability is going to get a little higher that they're going to close. But everything in the actual specific deal card itself, you have to put in. That's not going to automatically know. You just throw in a percentage. Yep. Okay. All right. This is great. Thank you so much. Keep me posted when it's going to be totally live, everything else. I will. I will find out and I'll let you know. All right. And send over those details. Thanks a lot. Have a good day. You too, Dina. Thank you. Bye now.",
