    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Brian Gallagher. I just have a really quick question. I just sent like a blast email, not to a big audience, a little less than 200 people. And I was going through the analytics part. I just wanted to see the – I could see like the opens and clicks and saves and stuff like that, replies, stuff like that. Is there a section for unopened? No, because I can't really track if it's been opened because we don't even know if it's been delivered or anything. It's just opened. Okay. The only thing I've come across like how to do that is like, you know, I could go at the bottom right and click open. Mm-hmm. Yep. Or do you, if you made like a roll-up list of who all the recipients were, and then who all, and then another list of who opened, what you really could do, I know it's kind of a, it's not the easiest way, but if you had both on the roll-up list, who are the recipients, as well as, or even have your original roll-up list, and then also have a roll-up list of who did open, what you could then do is if you go to your advanced name search, that you could, instead of saying predefined fields, you switch it to name roll-up. And then what you would do is say on list and then pick the list that would have the recipients and then add another row to your criteria using the name roll-up again saying not on list and then pick the list of people that did open. So that should give you the opposite. Okay. All right. you gotta use two roll-ups on that one yeah okay who got it and then who's not on the list of people that opened it gotcha okay alright I can figure that out or I could just use chat GPT maybe to compare the list or something here I can send you an example I'll just here I'll just do it in like here I'll do it in one of my databases just so you can kind of see what it looks like because you know how to make a roll Do you know how to make the roll-up from the area down at the bottom right? Yep. Okay. Yeah, you just kind of go in, select it, make a list. So here, let me generate what it would look like. Here with me. Now, obviously, my list names or codes are going to be different than yours, but at least you could see what it looks like. So you go to Advanced. So you know how you go now, like, to Name, and you go to Advanced, and the first option is Predefined Fields? I'm going to do that. Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Yep, I'm there. So you switch that first dropdown from predefined fields to name rollup. And then that's where you take your list of your recipients. And then here, let me pick a different list for that. Here, I'm going to send this over to you. So you'd say, I want people who are on this list, but then not on the other list. yep okay okay and what is and this is brian gallagher right yep dlr search okay brian.gallagher717 at gmail.com send it to my do my work one apparently not your way to update yeah when i first signed up i was just using my gmail before my company Oh, okay. Yeah, what's your work email? It's brian.gallagher at dlrsearch.com. So that's D as in David, L as in Larry, R as in Ringo. Search.com. DLR search. Now, do you want that used for everything? Like, do you even get your invoices to the Gmail? Because I can update that, too. Let me see where those go. Yeah, if you don't mind, just, yeah, you can just push everything to my work email. That'd be great. Okay. let me see where they go now they'd probably go to the gmail I bet dlr search yeah okay so I'll fix that too Okay, so now that I have this email, let me do this for you. Okay, save that. Then I'll come over, I'll make a new email to you. Okay. I just sent you an email. Let me know when you got it. Okay. There it is. Okay. oh cool okay does that make sense like saying that it does yep i think so yep okay yeah i would just i just have to save the roll-up list that'll take me two seconds and i'll and then go through it and compare the two like if you already had the recipients on one that eliminates one step because you probably started it from a roll-up um you just have to make a roll-up of who did open and then just do the search that way. Okay. Okay. Cool. All right. Well, if you need anything else, let us know. Okay. Thanks so much, Robin. Oh, all right. Oh, wait. I do have a quick question. Okay. That's be really quick because I do have a 2 o'clock call, but real quick. So I was having issues integrating, like, importing records from Zoom Info into PCR. you PCR. Is that a Zoom info issue or is that a PCR issue? Who do I talk to for that? What were you using to do it? Were you using PCR capture or what were you... I think so. Somebody set me up when I froze like nine months ago, I think. Somebody set me up and I think PCR helped me and then Zoom info helped me and it worked initially, actually, because we tested it. I was just doing like one-off records or whatever. and then and ever and for a while there and still persist it's still an issue it kind of depends like where you're starting from like if you were going to somebody's zoom info page and then using pcr capture to bring it in then it would be us now we did a push an update yesterday i don't know if anything to zoom info we might want to check that and see if it works now. If you were starting from ZoomInfo and doing their tool, then that would be addressed through them because then you're kind of starting from them pushing to us. That's what it was. That might be on their side. If you're in a name record, you've got to have one of those really expensive accounts to use that feature. Gotcha. The PCR capture should do it as well. Okay. All right. So the PCR capture. So if I'm in Zoom Info and I find Bob Smith and I want to integrate Bob Smith into PCR, you're saying I should go into PCR first or hit the thing in Zoom Info? So what our tool would do is if you had PCR capture stuff, it's a Chrome extension created by us. If you're on like LinkedIn or Zoom info, it pops up at the right. Now, if it's an extension that says Zoom info doing it, then that would be on theirs. And it might just maybe mean it's got some bad connection stuff. I probably just see what you're doing just to confirm. But I know you got a meeting. Do you want to give me a call back after? Yeah, yeah, I will. Yep. Yep. So you should have my signature in the email that I sent you that has my extension. So you can just give me a call. Sound good? Okay, cool. All right. Have a fun meeting. You're welcome. Yeah. Bye. Bye.",
