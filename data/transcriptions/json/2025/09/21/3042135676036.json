I'm just trying to figure out, even yesterday, because on the company option, like the names under that, it doesn't give us an option to show the email address, which was supposed to be showing ever since. Yeah, what was the name of the company again, so I can pull you up? Titanium Recruiting. So on the names tab, of the company record, that will follow whatever that user has set as their name search results layout. Sorry, let me just try to pull up. Rick, can I find it, Tyler? Yeah, so if you go to name up at the top and just hit search, like doing a blank search, that's what will reflect on the names tab on a company record. So if you have users that aren't seeing that, they just need to adjust their name search results layout. Name search results layout. Okay, let me just pull it up real quick. Sorry, the PC is loading. Oh, okay. Yeah, so if you just go to name again up at the top, you'll see a little gear icon in the right-hand corner. And then you'll go to results page in that pop-up. And that's where you can edit that layout to whatever information you need under the names tab of the company record as well as the search results. So name. And then the name search. Sorry, let me. And there's like a gear, right? Along with the basic search. Yep. Yeah, over to the right. And then magnifying glass. Yep. It's already loading. Yeah, cool. Cool. I think that's going to be it, Tyler. We appreciate it. Yep, not a problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. All right, I'll just call if there's anything else. Yep, sounds good. Thanks. All right, bye-bye.",
