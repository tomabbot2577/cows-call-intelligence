    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, hi. It's Annie from Triumph Staffing, and I've got Lampin and Cal on the line with us. He has a problem that when he's logging into his Outlook, it's the Outlook, you know, the Outlook portal tool, it's asking him to put in his password, and when he does, it's saying incorrect password or something. Oh, okay. It's basically not letting me log in. Could you do a screenshot with him and try and figure it out? Sure. Yeah, he just needs to update Outlook portal. That's kind of a symptom of our older version. It will not take passwords anymore. So I can actually just – Could you help? Yeah, I could email you a link to just click and download, and then once you download and install the new updated version, it'll stop prompting you for a password. All right, could you help him with that? Yeah, if you could walk me through that, that would be great. Sure. I'll just open up a screen share here. And in your browser, just go to a new tab and then go to meetings.ringcentral.com. meetings.ring meetings.ringcentral.com Yep. And when you're there, it should prompt you for a meeting ID. I can give you that whenever you're ready. That's five. Sorry, let me make sure that's the right one. Oh, here we go. Yeah, 540-205-586. Got it. Annie, you okay, hon? Smoke is gone. All right. Should I enter a name now? Yeah, sure, Len. There you go. Join meeting now. There we go. Perfect. If it asks about joining with audio, You can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. There we go. And you might have to click on like screen one or something to highlight it before sharing. Yeah, I'm trying to see the right one. It's going to be that one, share. There we go. Perfect. I can see that. All right. In a new tab, just go to our homepage, which is pcrecruiter.net. Perfect. And under that drop-down at the top right called Technical Info, there's Downloads. All right, scroll down a little bit on the left. You have PC Recruiter for Microsoft Outlook. Go to the down there. Yeah, perfect. Download that. That will start a download at the top right of your screen. And once that completes, we'll just open the file to run the installer. And this installer will both interface with Outlook and, I guess more importantly, uninstall the old version so that I won't have a conflict between the two versions or anything? Right, yeah. It's just going to be an update. It'll replace the old version of the Outlook portal. Okay. We're almost there. Okay. There we go. Open that file. And if it asks about making changes, you can say yes to that. All right. It's doing it on the other screen that you can't see, but I'm just going through. I accept the terms of the license agreement. Next. Program files. I can just drop it wherever it's going to drop in the program files, right? Yeah, just hit next. I don't have to drop it anywhere else. Yeah, right. And then let's hit install. There we go. And it's now in the process of doing the installation. Perfect. It's taking half a minute for anything to happen on the status bar. There we go. Okay. Finish. Perfect. All right. Theory is done. Yeah, let's try opening up Outlook and see if you still have that prompt. All right. There we go. Fantastic. Awesome. Thank you so much for your help. Yeah, no problem. Happy to help any time. Anything else you were having trouble with with PCR? Nope. That's about it for now. Thank you very much. All right. All right. Thanks. Thank you. Have a great rest of your day. Thanks so much. And, Annie, thank you for handling this. All right. All right, dear. Bye-bye. Garrett, bye. Thank you.",
