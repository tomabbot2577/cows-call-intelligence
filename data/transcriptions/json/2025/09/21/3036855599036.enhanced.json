    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Nadia over at MedBest Recruiting. How are you? Good. How are you? Pretty good. I have a user that is having an issue with sending out a black email, and I did send in a ticket for it yesterday. However, we worked on what they said to do, and it's still not working. Which database are they in? MedVest Recruiting and the user is Brian S. Just pulling up that ticket now too. Okay. And what's the roll-up list that he's sending to? So the roll-up is 4-2-1-6. I have a feeling I know what's happening, and you can tell me if I'm on the right track here. He's trying to send the same campaign again. If you tried to send a campaign once and it didn't go through, but then you send it again, would the system automatically think, oh, we already sent this email, so we can't send it again? Yes. So it's not necessarily the same email, but a name can only be added to the same campaign once, whether it's sent or not sent. Okay. So then I know how to fix it. So then we just need to adjust the campaign name, like do a new campaign name, and then it should send out, correct? Exactly. Okay. That's probably what it is. Okay, I just wanted to make sure you were checking the track. Yeah, because I was looking and I was like, okay, so maybe those eight names weren't on the list the first time and that's why they got added. But yeah, if you were using an existing campaign, so the way the resend checking works is based on the form letter. so you could if you if they weren't sent the the form letter in the first campaign you can send it to them again with the resent like you could just have the resent checking on and it will pick up that they weren't sent that form letter however because the campaign shows them in that campaign already, they can't be added again. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. So then the best thing I can do for this user is basically have him create a new campaign. Anyways, I did notice an error on his on the form letter, so I might have him actually change it a little bit. And then we could resend to this entire list again. Yep. Yeah, and if you don't want to send to that eight, just turn on resend checking and be like hey don't send this to anybody who's gotten this form letter in the past 30 days or something like that or if you have him revise it and want that revised version to go out to the eight you don't have to worry about the reset checking then it doesn't matter yeah okay just be aware that if it's just editing a form letter like do normally use resun checking in the campaign? Yes, that's how I train the recruiters to do that. But right now they're using the campaign situation since that's different. Yeah, so what you... Go one more time. You cut out there for a second. Well, I was saying it just seems a little bit different than the original old school, you know, resun check, do not send this letter within the last 30 days. It just seems a little bit different. So one thing you have to be aware of with that is if you edit, the way the resend checking works is on the back end when you create a form letter, it gets assigned an ID number. So if you edit an existing letter, it still has that same ID number, and that's what the Resend Checking looks at. Okay. So if it's just like an edit to a letter and you have Resend Checking on, it'll still pick up that same ID. Ah, okay. All right. So then probably the best course of action would be to create a new form letter, copy and paste, and adjust the letter, and then create a new campaign, and then that should send out to everyone. Yep, exactly. Okay. Cool. then I will work with Mr. Brian and tell him all that. I appreciate your help today, Tyler. Thank you so much. Not a problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. All right, man. Thank you. Appreciate you. Have a good day. Have a good one.",
