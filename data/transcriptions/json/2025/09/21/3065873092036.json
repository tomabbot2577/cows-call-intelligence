    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Danny over at Kimmel. Hi. How are you? Not bad. How are you doing? Oh, pretty good. I am running into an issue, and I would have just did a ticket on it, but it's kind of urgent. I don't know if you can help me or show me a different way to do it. Let me see if I can find the ticket here. I didn't. I didn't put a ticket in. Oh, I thought you said you were going to say that. Sorry about that. I misheard you. It's all right. When I go into a candidate and if I try to click on, like, under their – we have a custom field, email, home, email, other, email work. if I click on that and the little email to send an email to it it is pulling up their it's pulling up the wrong email address it's pulling up the regular email address the regular field email address and you're just on the name record when it's doing that yep and it's doing that in bulk email too or like I want to send an email with a form on it And what is your, okay, so the database is Kimmel. What's the username that you're in as? Okay. What name record should I use as an example? You can use mine, Danny Moore. M-O-O-R-E, Danny. Should be titled as tester. Company name is candidates. Okay. So the section at the top is more like a card. But do you see the Appalachia 643 at Gmail? That's what they're actually sending it to. Okay. Is that the issue? It's actually sending it to DMORC Kimmel, even though I click on the Appalachia. Okay. Let me try. Let me see. Do you guys have me in here? I'm going to send an email to this too. I'll do email other. I'll put my personal email in there. Oh, it did send it. Okay. Yeah. So I think that first part is just like a card. Like, here's some details about the person that you're looking at, but it should be going to the email address below. Okay. All right. So the card's wrong, but it does go to the accurate email. Yeah. The card's just kind of like, it could be any person. It could even be a custom field that you make for email, not just ours. So that's just kind of like a little preview of who you're looking at. But the email that it's going to would be the one below at the bottom. Okay. All right. I'll get back to you if I have another issue on it. All right. If that makes sense. All right. Have a good day. Thanks. You too. Bye. Bye.",
