    "text": " Hi, this is David Riss. Sorry that I missed your call. Please leave me a message here or you can send me a text. Also include best time to reach back out to you. Anyway, I look forward to catching up with you and thanks for calling. Bye now. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press one for more options. Hi, David. Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter wanted to give you a quick call. We had been in touch in the past about PC Recruiter and possibly exploring the cloud-based version of PC Recruiter. And it sounds like there are some growth issues with your database size, so I wanted to give you a call and kind of rekindle that discussion with you, see if that might be of interest or if you had any additional questions about that. Please give me a call. When you get a moment, let me know. My phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Give me a call. Let me know if you'd be open to a discussion. I'll pop an email as well. Thanks.",
