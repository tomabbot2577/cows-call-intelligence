    "text": " Thank you for calling. David O'Connor. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello, this is Steph. Hi, it's Robin Mantoni. How are you? I'm good, Robin. How are you doing? Oh, pretty good. So, the card expired. I went in and added it as a new card with the correct expiration date because there's no option to delete a card. You have to turn auto-pay off on a card before you can delete it. So let me see. Do you have two-starred payment? I only see 2026. Yeah, it's the only card in there, right? Okay. And the new date is 7-28. Okay, so let me see. I don't think it's going to let me change a card. Do you have the card with you? Yeah, I have it right here. Okay, bear with me one second. Let me turn auto pay off because it has to be off before I can do it. Okay. Okay, customer. Okay. Let's see. Now I can go, and I can't just edit a card with a date. You actually have to put everything in front. So let me delete it. Okay. And now I'll add it. Okay. Okay. So what is that card number? And the name on the card is your name, David O'Connor, right? Correct. Okay. What's the card number? 4034. Okay. 8600. Okay. 2530. Whoops. 4034. 8600. Okay. 2530. Okay. 2026. And then the expiration month and year. 0728. Okay. The CVC number? 235. And what is the city associated in the zip? That's Murrysville, M-U-R-R-Y-S-V-I-L-L-E, PA 15668. 15668. 668, okay. And Murrysville is M-U-R-R-Y-S-V-I-L-L-E. Okay. Correct. All right. Add card. Okay. Got that done. Now I can go ahead and turn auto pay back on. Assume you want it on the due date. Okay. Do you want me to go ahead and try processing? Sure. Okay. Okay, so it's queued up for auto-pay. It takes a moment for me to confirm. Well, when I was doing it, it was immediately failing, so that's good. Yeah. I think it was probably still remembering the original card. Okay. Did it give you any alert, like you have to turn off auto-pay? It should have done that. I didn't see anything like that. Okay. I'm waiting. I'm sorry. No worries. It just takes a little bit. If you want, I can let you go and go do your things. I'll just follow up with you if it doesn't go through. Yeah, if there's a problem, just reach out. Yeah, once it does go through, you should also just get an email sent to you. Gotcha. So you get it paid. It just takes a few minutes to do it. All righty. Beautiful. Thanks, Ellen. Thanks. All righty. Bye. Bye-bye.",
