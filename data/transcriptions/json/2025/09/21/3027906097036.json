    "text": " Hello, this is Brian. Hi, Brian. My name's Corey. I was calling to find out how I go about canceling my account before my next billing cycle, which is probably going to be August 1st. Okay. You said your name was Corey. Is that correct? Yes. Okay. All right. Let's see. Corey. What's the name of the company, Corey? S-A-R-A-M-M-I. All right. Okay, you're moving to a new solution, getting out of the industry? A little bit of both. So I'm moving into a coaching practice. I'm still going to keep my recruiting practice, but I'm kind of downsizing it. So I am moving to, like, just a very basic, like, an ATS system. Okay. Now, there is an option to put PCR on hold. You can do that. If that seems like that might make sense, you can go that route. but just throwing those out there just in case those might work for you okay that's all just sharing yes yeah i appreciate that absolutely absolutely so it looks as though all right this you're not gonna be happy about this and you're gonna probably need and want to send me a letter that I can forward up the chain. Here's the reason, unless I look at something just... Oh, wait a minute. Hang on. No. Okay. All right. So, back in 2015, your agreement was signed in June. What that means is per your agreement, you have 11 months left on your current agreement. So you would be responsible for 80% of the user fees that you still have. So it's just one user. You'd be responsible for 11 times 80% of $75 to cancel your account. I know you don't want to do that. Totally understand that. which is why I would suggest that you write a letter and just say, Hey, this is what's happening. Um, maybe put some hardship in there some of some kind and just say, I don't have any options. This is the route I'm going. And, you know, and put something in there about financial, you know, and you probably will be able to get away with the fact that you didn't give the 30 day notice. So, um, and probably, okay. Okay, so I'm confused. You're saying I signed something in 2015 to have PC Recruiter for 10 years? No, for a year. And then on that anniversary of that signature, each year it evergreens for another year. So in June of this past, just last month, it evergreens for another year. and I would not I would never get anything sent to me saying that you're in it for another year like you're saying in 2015 I signed something that said okay every June you can bill me for a year yes okay I wouldn't sign that I don't I will send you a copy of the agreement. I will send you a copy of your agreement so you have it. And like I said, I knew you wouldn't be a fan of what I was sharing with you. And it does happen from time to time with clients, which is why I strongly suggested the letter with the information, you know, worded the way it worded because you, there's a, if you just ask for a cancellation, they're going to say nope. And, or they're going to say, yeah, we can definitely do that. You know, it's X amount of dollars. And you don't want that. You want to say, you want a letter that I can forward up the chain to the right people and go, hey, this person just called and they just re, you know, their contract just renewed a month ago, actually less than a month ago, because it was one day less than a month ago. And they're asking if they can, you know, do this, you know, cancel their account. because of X, Y, and Z. And like I said, hardship, financials, you name it, put it in there because you don't want to deal with what I'm sharing with you. You know what I mean? So I'm just trying to help you here. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. How long can you put the account on hold? Indefinitely. It costs $20 a month. oh so you have to pay to put it on hold that's correct yeah okay i'm not doing that totally cool totally understand would you want a backup of your data now what that means is you get a copy of all the data that you ever put into pcr plus resumes and attachments when you get that backup you can't do anything with it unless you open it up inside of another system that runs Microsoft SQL. So it's not like you can open it up and go, oh, there's all my contacts and phone numbers and email addresses. No. I exported what I needed. That was where I was going to go next was taking advantage of exporting what you needed. And you've already done that. So one of the things when you export, there's a default layout and then there's the layout that you have on your screen so that you can get more information, all the columns of information. And we just want to make sure you had that taken care of as well. Yeah, I did. Yeah, I'm just looking at – so, yes, I did download everything where it took, like, the notes. So, I'm just looking to see where it actually said in the agreement that it was going to be a year commitment every year. I definitely don't remember. You need me to send it to you? Yeah. No, I haven't. Okay. But I'm trying to see where that is actually stated. Do you know what area, what section it's stated in? I do not know the answer to that. So again, you can ask them in the email. Well, how did you know that that was in my agreement? Because I've been selling PCR for about 20 years plus. Okay. All right, so where do I send? I'm sorry. Okay. Well, I'm going to continue looking. Yeah, go ahead. I mean, I'm going to keep looking to see where that is. But where do I send that letter? Send it to Robin, R-O-B-I-N, at mainsequence.net. Okay. Okay. Is that you? No, I'm Brian. Robin is the person who has billing and things like that. So best to send it straight to her and she'll be able to respond to you. Okay. All right. Well, I'll send that letter and hopefully they'll be able to cancel it because I didn't realize that. If I did, I would have canceled before June. But at least it's not six months later. Like, it's literally, like you said, like within a month. Right. Right, and that's why, you know, that's why if you send that letter heartfelt with that information in it, you have a better, if you don't send that letter, there's zero chance. You know what I'm saying? I know that for a fact. But if you send that letter, there's a chance they'll be able to do that for you. Right, okay. In my agreement, I'm not seeing, I see this place where it says this agreement will begin on and will terminate on. I don't know if that's the fee agreement. There's no dates in there. There's nothing written on that. I don't know if that. I've got the signature page that shows that you signed it and we signed it on the 25th of June in 15. Yeah. Oh, I have a signature page. Yeah. I do have a signature page, but I'm saying in the agreement, I don't see, there is nothing written where it says this agreement will begin on and will terminate on. There's no dates in there. I'm just saying there's no dates in that fair enough and if you have questions about that I would include the questions in the email so and you know so that somebody can address those for you you know where in my agreement where does it say this where my agreement does it say that okay yeah because I'm not sure alright I'm going to read through this agreement again and see but I will send that letter okay alright well I appreciate your help and information and suggestions Brian so thank you so much and I guess I'll see what happens okay alrighty alright thank you thanks bye bye",
