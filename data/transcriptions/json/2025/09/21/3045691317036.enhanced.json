Jim Wise sent me a note here that you were in his voicemail. He asked me to give you a call because he's kind of transitioning out of the company here. So I wanted to call and see kind of how I could help. No, I really appreciate that. I did wind up corresponding with Robin yesterday and she got me squared away. Okay. Everything's well? Yep. Everything's good. I got everything I needed. Okay. Excellent. Excellent. I really appreciate the follow-up. For sure. All right. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, brother. Bye. Take care. Bye now.",
