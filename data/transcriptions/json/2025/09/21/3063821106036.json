    "text": " Scott Hewitt. Hey, Scott. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. Hey, Jim. Hey, how are you? I was about to call you. I happened to glance down and realized I had missed it by a couple of minutes, so I apologize for being a few minutes late. No, you're good. I couldn't remember where we – I was just looking at my email to see if I was supposed to call you or you were supposed to call me. So, no problem. I was just finishing up with the IT department on the setup exchange and different things I need for a new job. So let's go for it, PC Recruiter. Excellent. Yeah. So I just want to kind of see what you're doing. So you are kind of rolling into the KBIC family, kind of rolling everything into them. Yeah. I work with people that do that. You're the third one in the last month or two. Really? And let's see. So I still have you as a current paid open PC Recruiter account. So I was confused by that. So I wanted to kind of see what was happening there and see what data you wanted to transfer or what. Okay. So I wasn't aware that we were still paying for it, I think. So my dad was the one that was in charge of the finances. He passed away in April. So we are still up to date on our payments, or where are we? I have no idea. Well, what it likely was, as I was looking, it looks like you all paid annually. So it may have been an annual invoice that was paid like last November. I don't know when, but that would mean it was paid for the period. Let's see if I have any activities to that. I don't, but I'll check and see. I'll check and see when it was paid. Okay, no problem. Yeah, because it's current and it's active. So I was able to access. I can't get in because I don't have a password, but the link is up. So I didn't know if you thought it might make more sense for us just to take the data that's in PC Recruiter right now and just move that because it's quicker than doing a data conversion from the – I think you went to LOXO, did you? Yeah. Okay. Or if you have added a lot since you went to LOXO, when did you leave? Five months ago. So, you know, we – let's see. We – yeah, it would have been February. So February, March, April, May, June, July. Yeah, so six months basically. But I was wondering if there was a way to just convert a few of those, a few of the candidates and sources that I have in there and put them on a file or something and then put it in with the old data from PC Recruiter. Well, easiest thing to do. So we could either convert the whole LOXO database or move the whole PC Recruiter database over. But if we move the PC Recruiter database, obviously that's not going to include anything that happened in the last six months. So probably, since you've been using the LOXO, we would most want to convert the LOXO database, which we can do here. KBIC covers the tab for that, and they would just need to get a data backup from LOXO, get it over to our conversion team here, and then they could do that data conversion. it's tricky to try and merge or share data or anything like that so we don't really want to try and take like just just the new data and merge it with the existing old pc recruiter data or anything like that so we'd want to do either one or the other and i would presume it sounds like you'd want the data that you put in the last six months so we probably want to just convert the lock so yeah i know how much of a pain in the butt that is uh but i actually felt like a lot of stuff that got converted over from PC Recruiter isn't that valuable because it was, I don't know, it came in a different format. And I think about Luxo, it was very strange. You couldn't, when you put in like a phone number, let's say, you would have to just come in as one number, basically, and you'd have to like space it out and redo it, reformat it. And then you'd also, a lot of the stuff that came in, came in under the same company name and it wasn't right. So it was, I don't know, maybe it would just be better for us just to do a piece of Recruiter, move that stuff over. I know that stuff is accurate. And then I guess I can take some of my stuff, can I put it into, like, Word or just the way to copy and paste it into Excel maybe? You could do something like that. You could do something like that. So what we could do is we could move, just basically pluck the database off of the Huey, enterprises link push put it over to kbic then that would all be there uh then you i don't know if you can work with locks with to get data out of into like a csv because you could map a csv into that database there's no cost to do it you could do it with the guidance i know brian knows how to do it but the crew at kbic knows how to do it um so you could map that in you could even update existing records but that's only going to be field data it won't be any like activities or or anything like that. It'll be primarily field data, if that might work. Okay. Hmm. Oh, man. I don't know. How long do you think it would take to do Luxo? They've been running about 90 days to get done, start to finish. 90, maybe a hair more than that to get the data converted. Yeah. Do you know if I can access Luxo after I cancel it as far as is there a time period there? I know it's usually month to month, but what is their policy on that? I don't know that. Do you mind, might I conference Brian Denton in? Would that be okay? Sure. Yeah, go ahead. Because I've been emailing with him as well, and he said, oh, let's set up a call. And he said, well, I'm talking to Scott on Monday. He said, oh, conference me in if you want, and I just want to make sure that would be okay with you just because he might know a little bit more or might have a suggestion. Yeah, that's fine. Perfect. Let me see if I can conference him right in. Hang on just a quick sec. I couldn't get him he didn't answer um but yeah so I think so yeah we kind of we have three options well really two because we could convert the LOXO database KBIC will pay for it it'll take about 90 to 120 days to get that done I would imagine that once you're out of their contract they don't give you access so likely whenever you pay for the last month once that month is done you're done. So you want to kind of time your cancellation knowing it'll be 90 to 120 days out because we'll still need access to get a final backup of the LOCSO data. Or we could move the PC recruiter data over. That's going to be the lion's share of it. And then if you can get the LOCSO out into a CSV, you could map that data in. And that would get you some field data, but it wouldn't get you any new resumes or new activities or anything like that. so the most complete is going to be doing a lock so conversion because that'll be all the pc recruiter data you had and plus everything new you've done okay um it's just 90 to 120 days and i know it's going to take that long because last time lock so it took that long yeah i'm moving it yeah this is crazy to me um but i get it it's a big task. I think I haven't done enough in the last five months to really, I mean, there is some valuable stuff in there, but what I can do is, I think this is the second option with the CVS, if I can just pull some of the field data, and then I can always kind of reconstruct any searches I was working on, that's fine. I think that would be better. I mean, if you think we can do the the old PC Recruiter database put it in pretty quickly? Is that? Yeah, that's a couple of days. I would need something signed from you that would say that you authorize us to move that database. Yeah. And you need it. Yeah, okay. So, yeah, I would just need something signed off that says I authorize the move of this database to KBIC. So once we have that, a couple of days, they would move the database and they would just take it and it would just show up under one of KBICs. And then you could import into that, update anything that it kind of finds as an update, and take it from there. Okay. Can I send an email? Do I have to have a signature on the email? What I can do, I can create a form in my DocuSign and just send it over to you. So I'll create a form. It'll have a click to sign and everything like that. So I'll send that over. And I'll talk with Denton and let him know kind of what's going on and what we're going to do with it. If he has any suggestions, I'll have him let you know, but this should be all good. It will be a lot quicker. Great. Is there a way for you to check on that as far as what the payments are for that or what I need to call to make sure that's canceled once it's moved over or whatever on my end? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I will check on that too, find out kind of how much it's paid, when we should cancel it, why it's still open, what's going on. I'll find out more detail on that for sure. Great. Great. So we'll make sure once we move the data, we'll make sure to cancel and check on that. So, yeah, I will check on that, too, and let you know. Perfect. All right. Well, thanks, Jim. All right. Thank you, Scott. We'll talk to you soon. All right. And do you have my new email address? Let me see if I do. I have the one I have is still scott at huey.com. Okay. I'm still checking out, but if you want to also have my new office email, it's shuey, so S-H-U-E-Y, at kvic.com. So K-B-I-C-K. Sorry, B-I-C.com. Perfect. I've updated my system there. And I'll kind of work with the shuey for now, but I'll update the kvic one so it's there soon. That's fine. All right. Very well. All right. Well, thank you very much, sir. We'll talk to you soon. All right, Jeff. Take care. All right.",
