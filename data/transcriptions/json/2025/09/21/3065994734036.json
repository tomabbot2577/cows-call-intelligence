Thank you and have a great day. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hi, Beth. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I was giving you a call regarding the open invoices again. We sent some statements using your Gmail address. I remember we had an issue with you receiving emails at your expert recruiting solutions from our billing portal. Not sure why. They are now going to your Gmail, but we still have some open payments. We have six months of open invoices. I sent a statement, but we do need to have payment on that account very soon. If you can please give me a call, my number is 440-946-5214. My extension is 5466. And if you have any questions or need help getting set up in this billing portal or making those payments, just please let me know. Hope you're having a great day and talk to you soon. Thanks.",
