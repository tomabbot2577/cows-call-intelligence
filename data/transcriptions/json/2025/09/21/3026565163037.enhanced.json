You left a request for support a while back, and I'm finally getting around to it. I hoped you had a little bit of time. We can just go over what may be happening with your email setup. You know, Mackenzie, the only problem with that is my researcher does all my email campaigns. So the perfect world would be to set up a Zoom where I could have him and specifically ask you the analytics. Are they going through, not going through, what we could do better, those kind of things. Could you just send me a calendar link and then we can connect that way? uh sure does a time tomorrow work um because it's kind of the end of my day but i could put you on the calendar for tomorrow and i could call you at a certain time yeah your time zone yeah we're eastern time zone and let's see here tomorrow is thursday i'm pretty open uh so if the time works for you most likely would be okay for me say 11 o'clock 11 a.m. tomorrow you want to call Eastern time who should I send it's you and Melwin 0 1 1 0 at gmail is that who I should send it to yeah that's correct uh-huh okay and then James at Evans and James calm is the other one that's you okay uh yeah I could send a calendar uh to for me I could call you tomorrow and we can get on like a Google meet and all share screen and we can we can go over what's going on.
