    "text": " Hey, Azel. Yo, hey, question for you. When you get people that still want to do user adjustments and cancel their accounts or if they're retiring and need data returns, do you still just send them over to Lombardo? Yeah, if they are canceling an account, they need to go talk to their account rep, Jim Lombardo. But if it's a data return, there's a email that Nick sent with kind of just a quick procedure, step by step. Let me forward that to you here. Let's see. Data return. Start it somewhere. Yes, start. What if they're adding users? Oh, adding users, you would create a new Fresh Test ticket. And at the top right, as you're creating that ticket, is a template for adding users and a template for the data return. I think that's part of the instructions in this email here. Yeah, so just click add new ticket and you'll see there's templates at the top right to choose from. Okay. And adding new users, I think it's just assigned to Robin somehow based on that template. Okay. Well, that's good to know. Let me forward you this. Yeah. At least there's some kind of procedure now. Where's the forward button? Oh, here we go. Tyler. Let me see. No, no. It's just now it's T. Troutman. Oh, shoot. I think it still comes to me anyway. Okay. Maybe not. There it is. Okay, yeah. So that's the data return procedure. It talks about the templates, I think, in there. Yeah, let me start that email. Okay. Cool, cool. Yep, let me know if anything else comes up. Any other questions come up? I felt that because I was like, man, I'm sending Jim all this shit. none of it's been just like a data return though but it's all been like i had one where it's like adding users and i didn't know that was a a thing yeah i think uh for some reason robin gets those now um they just adjust the billing so yep well all righty i appreciate it thanks garrett no problem talk to you later",
