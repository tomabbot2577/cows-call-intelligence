    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Gus in Atlanta. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Great, great, great. Thanks. Quick question. I'm trying to update our presentation template with our new logo. Okay. So I'm in presentation settings, but I don't see this. And I tried to look it up on ChatGPT, but I don't see how I could add the logo. Yeah, I wouldn't look up any of our sections in ChatGPT. Sometimes it gets some really wrong stuff. I had somebody do that. I'm like, oh, that's not right at all. So what you're going to do, okay, so you're under system, right? Yeah. Okay. So you'll click on your template name, and then up at the top, like, so when you're – hold on one second. Let me just get there so I don't stumble over my words as much as I would. Okay. So when you have your template up, over at the right where you see kind of like where a spacing where you would have the header, like above your fields and your section, you'll click directly on that spot. Yeah. And it says upload new image. Right. Then you're going to browse and upload. Then it's going to list it. And then you actually have to click on it once it's uploaded. Because you could upload like five times at once. That's what I was missing. Yeah. I trust me. I have done it myself. I'm like, wait a minute. And I'm like, oh, yeah, you have to select it. Like you could upload four different files there. And so you have to pick which one. Most of the time you're just doing one. So it's not as obvious that you might have to actually click it. And once it turns blue, then you know that it's selected. Let me go back and do that again. Candidate. OK. Candidate. Presentation templates. and then I'll select this one. Okay. Click. Click. And then close. Does it automatically save? No, you'll have to. So once you upload it, you'll have to click save at the bottom right. Like you should see it in your tablet now. It doesn't say save. It just says close. Oh, okay. So, yeah. So, oh, you're in that screen? Okay, yeah. So do you see where it says image name date? Is it like blue like it's selected? Yes, ma'am. Okay. So that's good. Then hit close. And you should see that image in your presentation. Yeah. How do I make my presentation background white? I think it all depends on the themes that you're using. Okay, so let me look at my theme. Select a theme. Yeah. Arrow. All of them. Sometimes there what I've done is taken the code from some themes and modified it. Like which one were you using before? I think it was Arrow. Okay. let me see customize hold on let me take this throw in here let me see if I can what kind of colors do you want to use blue blue and white modify this style sheet code to have a white background and what kind of blue do you want to use? Like a navy or a royal? It's kind of like a powder blue. Okay. Let's see if this worked. Otherwise, I might need to have maybe somebody like Drew do it. I'm just kind of throwing in chat, GPT, having it modify the colors, like from one of the original things. I'm going to check this out in my own database, though. Another question. Does PC Recruiter have an integration with Wedge? With who? Wedge? Mm-hmm. I've never heard of them, to be honest. It's Wedge HR. They do, like, video resumes. Oh, no. I mean, sometimes people do things through an API, but there's so many services out there. It's almost hard to keep up with them anymore. Yeah, it's true. And we don't like spending too much. In, like, our developer time, you know, just like, oh, one person wants to use it. It's not worth it for us to take developers and projects. Okay, so I'm going to try this. Let's go new theme. New theme, and we'll call it – Oh, there it is. Save presentation template. Okay, continue. Okay. And then let me go to the – okay, here's this. Here's this. Close. Save presentation template. Okay. I'm going to try doing, what is this doing, mine? Powder blue. Well, kind of. Let's see. I'm going to go down there. Well, here, I'm going to take this code that I generated. Let me find your stuff. Hold on one second. okay bear with me I am going to I'm going to try to upload I'm not a good peace recruiter when you get into like all that style sheet code I'm not the best so I just kind of threw it in chat GPT and then from here. Which database are you in? Staff Financial. Okay. And what's your PCR username? I don't need the password, just the username? Gus. Just Gus. All right. Let me see. Okay. Presentations. Candidate presentation templates. Okay, which one were you working in? The NSG. The military, the NSG, and the HMT. Okay, let's just do the NSG Canada presentation with logo. Does that sound okay? Yes. I'm going to try styling, edit, new, theme name, white wrist powder blue. My style sheet. I'm going to throw this in there. Phase. Okay. If we don't like this template styling, we can go from here. Let me just see what it looks like. Why didn't it change it yet? Oh, maybe it still needs a phase. Hold on. Let me change it like I didn't mind. Oh, because I'm in that one. You just had a white background. That's fine. White's fine. Well, what I did is I kind of threw it in and I said make this white, a white background with, oh, look, oh, I see. You want the top portion. Okay. Okay. Are you just talking about the image at the top, that portion? Yeah, that's all I want. Okay. All right. Let me start over then. Okay, where did I – okay. I'm not sure. Okay, let me see. Let's see if this helps them. Okay. I think it's a little bit more what you're looking for. Okay, so do this for me. Go back off the system. I just want to have you reload it just to make sure. And then go to your presentation, presentation templates. Okay, system, presentation template. And then pick your thing. I have a new theme in there called white with powder blue. candidate presentation presentation template and we're gonna go white where the hell is it so it says under styling where you got like your layout the styling I have a new choice in there call white okay okay so okay so now hit preview and let me know if you like that a little bit better how do you hit preview. Down at the bottom right. Preview. Preview. Preview. Yeah, I don't see the logo there, though. Oh, it's up at the very top. Let me put it up there. Which template are you in? Which template are you in? I need to switch. Okay, so I'm going to go system, candidate presentations, white with powder blue. Edit. I'm not sure I like the powder blue like I thought he had before. Okay. So continue. I got the preview. Oh, that's perfect. Woo! I mean, do you want more color on the left? Because it looks like it all went white now. Oh, yeah. More color on the left. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Let me see what I can do there. Hold on one second because my first one it had the powder blue all around but not at the top um let me see can i tell chat chat what that is okay so i'm going to go hmt nsg white with powder blue perfect okay hold on i got to play around with this theme though that it generated I just got to find my window that I was doing it in because I tend to open up a lot of windows and then I lose our map okay so let's see it wasn't that one it wasn't that one how do I open so much stuff I have my check in the tea window. All right. Got to work backwards here. Not this window. Not that one. Oh. Thank you. Let's see. Sorry, it's generating the code. Awesome. Thank you. what's coming down the road what new developments y'all have um pcr9 um i think some like ai job match stuff a whole bunch of stuff coming feature called deals in pcr9 or i'm sorry not i'm sorry pcrm the newer one um quick question does the AI like if I was looking I was trying to figure it out in the system like I just wanted to find somebody with Sage 100 within this vicinity I didn't know how to use the the AI um kind of just gotta it's gotta work and you go like find resumes with things like that sometimes i still think just doing a regular search is better though um because you know any kind of matching um i think it's coming within a month let me ask you let me ask you another question so like if i was to like franchise my business and I wanted to give a new franchise access to the database that I already have, but I didn't want that person to see all the notes from everybody else in the system. Is that possible? Are you still there? Are you there? Sorry, my headset is getting very sensitive. It's got a very long wire, and apparently I've trampled my chair over it way too many times. So every once in a while, I move it wrong. You said if I franchise my business, that's kind of where it cut off. Okay. So say I wanted to give a client the ability to search my database, but I didn't want to give them access to see my notes. Is that possible? Not really. you'd probably have to have something like some kind of interface build. I think, have you ever talked to anybody at Carbon Web? A lot of times they do some great work with like API stuff that's very custom. Okay, no, but let me ask you another question. So like for MRI, they use PCR, right? Yeah, but they're all separate databases. Oh, they're all separate databases. Yeah, each person has their own, each office customer has their own database. Like the owner of that business owns their data. They just happen to pay a franchise fee to MRI. Got it. Yeah, it doesn't, each one has it. Just like how you have your own login, they do too. Got it. Okay. Got it. Did you get that figured out? Nope. I'm now trying to find your window here. I want to try uploading my new version. Okay, hold on one second. Get out of this. Get out of this. Get out of this. I'll be right back. Okay. I don't like what it's generating. let me take I don't like what it's generating still doing the same thing that feels like okay I'm going to delete this white with powder blue I'm going to start over Look at the code, see what would be. Okay, let me see this code. I want to really just edit some parts of it, and see if I can tell it what parts to edit. I can tell it by name. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I don't really know what's in the presentation. I'm going to call just background. Thanks for your help, by the way. No problem. I'm just trying to figure out. There's a lot of tags in here, and I just don't know what piece is which. Color presentation viewer layout attachment section. I'm going to start over in chat GPT. Chat GPT. Thank you. okay Okay. I'm looking at what it's generating. Kind of just taking my wording and running it through it again. Thank you. Okay, let me try this. Edit. New. Powder. Blue. Better. Save. Better. Better. Maybe. Okay. So go into your, go back to your, change your presentation template. I don't know if you have to leave it and come back. Okay. Try the new choice called muted powder blue. Okay. Hang on. Actually, if you go into the one that says blinded presentation without salary, if you go into that first one and hit preview, I already have it applied to that. Okay, so let me just preview. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Beautiful. Beautiful. Okay, so if you apply that one to your others, I think you might like it more. Let's see. Hang on. I'm going to do that right now. I just want to kind of see. Resume, questionnaire. select a theme where's a muted power blue okay I used the word muted because I thought the other one looked a little too the first color I tried to use is a little too like eastery blue yep no problem I just thought I think the muted color is easier on the eyes thank you thank you thank you oh no problem oh got another question yeah when I go to send a interview confirmation I wanted to just change the the title that comes across from Staff Financial Group to North Point Search Group. How do I do that? Okay. So what are you doing? Okay. So if I'm going to send an interview confirmation. Okay. Now how are you doing it? Is it a pipeline email? So I'm going to go into the position. I'm going to go into the pipeline. and then I click on the date. So is it, I guess it might be, is it pipeline templates in there? Yeah, I think so. So yeah, if you're doing it one-off from an interview record, if you go to system, form letters, go to pipeline emails. System, form letter. And you might change, yeah, you actually just have it as text. we don't put your company name anywhere is it position letters what is it it's going to be probably pipeline emails let me know if this is the one that you're looking at let me just type in pipeline pipeline emails pipeline emails if you enter confirmation edit you just have to replace net tax we can't merge your company name because it's not really stored anywhere Okay, so this pipeline letter that I got here, how do I make that my default template? Well, so you already have a default. Okay, let me go to my default then. Okay, there it is. That's it. Let me fix that. From NorthPoint search group. So let me just change that. So default is the one like when you go to like action email from like a pipeline record. That's the one that pops up first. Okay. So I got that down. Now I'm going to – let me add my logo here. Can I add my logo? I would make sure you're using it from the server image store, using like a web-based link. That way – A web-based link. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay, so let me grab this copy image address from my website. Yeah, use that as the source. Yeah. And then I'll shrink this down. Let's not let me shrink it down. Hang on. It's not letting me shrink it. Hold on. Well, X out of here. Kind of like drag the corner. Usually it's best to kind of maybe like resize it, like put it like in an image editor, resize it and upload it to your store. That way it's not so big and just being resized because it makes your email bigger too. Yeah, hang on a few seconds. I usually resize, but hang on. I think I just pasted it inside that corner, which was no bueno. Oh, there you go. Well, this is good. Starting to look like a freaking company. Anything else I can do to change? What do you mean to change? to add my logo throughout? No, not really. I mean, you probably want to make sure. It's like in your signature. Probably just put it in your signature. Yeah, got that. Yeah, got that. Okay, so I'm going to just for grins try to click on this interview confirmation. Beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you. You are welcome. have a great day talk to you soon alrighty thanks enjoy the point drink lots of beer bye bye",
