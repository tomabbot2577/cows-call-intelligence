    "text": " Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Sorry, it's Rich. One last question. I noticed in my settings, it's got Google syncing to ricklobe at gmail.com. Should I, you know, what's interesting is on my laptop, it's turned on. On this one, it's offering me the option to turn it on. Thinking, okay. Does that have anything to do with it or am I just being ridiculous? Let me take a look on my screen for, okay. So it's at the top right of Google. You have your icon there. Okay, I see. Syncing is on. Syncing personalized Chrome across all your devices. On my all-in-one, it's giving me the option, you know, it's giving me the option to turn it on. and on my laptop it's giving me the option to turn off. Okay. Are you signed into the same account on both devices? It's the same email address? Yes. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure. I will, I'll ask the team if they think the syncing might affect it at all. It would basically just have all of your, when sync is turned on, all of your settings will match across your different devices, your browser settings. So it's up to you if you want to experiment turning that on or off. But basically, it would just make sure you have the same bookmarks, the same general settings, the same extensions installed across all of your devices that is logged into that particular. So it shouldn't matter. Yeah, it might not matter, but I'll run it by the team and see if they think that would play into it at all. But, yeah, good looking out. Maybe something to look at as well. I'll just make a note on that one. Awesome. All right. Yeah. So I will. Yeah, I'll get back to you soon. And let me know if anything changes on your end as well. All right. Thank you very much. Thanks.",
