  "transcript_text": "Welcome to Zoom. Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just... You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning. This is Jim. Thank you. Hey, how's it going? Hello, Garrett. How are you? Good. How are you, Garrett? Good. I work with Brian Lucas, just so you're wondering who I am. My name's Ashley. So I'm going to be working closely with Brian. Awesome. Excellent. Excellent. It's good to meet you. Hi, Brian. How are you? Good. How are you? Ashley, you could change your name on the Zoom. Did you have to download Zoom? Yeah. I'm going to have to edit all of this. Yeah. I just changed my name on it. Okay. Forgive us. This is literally like our first Zoom call at Eisner Amper. Oh, well. No, because we use Teams. Okay. And Garrett, what do you use? I don't think Garrett uses Zoom. Oh, for our trainings, we'll use RingCentral, but you won't need to download it. I can just give you a link for each one when I invite you to our trainings and it'll open up on your browser. OK. All right. Perfect. Excellent. OK. So should we be on video or because you guys aren't? It doesn't matter to me. We don't need to be. I just keep my camera always off by default, but we don't need to be. What we're going to do today is just run through kind of a quick needs analysis, actually, with Garrett. I think he's got a few questions for you about your setup, what features, functions, integrations you want to set up and utilize with PC Recruiter. So Garrett's going to be your trainer from here forward, a main point of contact for how-tos and training questions. I would be a main point of contact for any time you need to add a user, drop a user, change, upgrade, anything like that, or if there's anything you don't know who to go to, I can get you to the right person if I can't help you myself. So I would always be a main contact as your account manager. Garrett's going to be your trainer. And like I said, he's going to run through some questions, and at the conclusion of today's call, he's going to get a few sessions on the schedule for you to get things started. But so I'll turn it over to you, Garrett, to kind of go through the questions you have. Sounds good. So, Garrett, let me just preamble this. So Ashley and I worked with PC Recruiter for a long time. We're former Markham and then CBiz, and now we're both here at Eisner Amper. And, you know, we love using PCR, which is why we contacted Jim to set us up here. Awesome. So we're familiar with it. Ashley is more of a day-to-day user, as she has been. I'm more of like I run the reports. So Ashley is really going to kind of be running this setup, so to speak. Okay. because she's been more involved. But I'm more than happy to listen and hear some suggestions or whatever, but Ashley's really going to take the lead on this. Sounds great. Awesome. Yeah, and when I send out the meeting invites or the training invites, you could forward it to Ashley or anybody, if you have any other team members you want to jump in. But, yeah, anybody is welcome to join the training. Totally up to you. Okay. Awesome. Perfect. Cool. Let me pull up. All right, so we've got these questions here. First off, are you going to be doing temporary contract placements, permanent placements, staffing? Yes. All of the above? Yeah. So at the beginning, we're going to do PERM. Like we're not really focusing on our temp practice yet, but we're not going to turn it away if it comes in. Okay. But PERM for the time being. Got it. All right. And what industry are you going to be recruiting in? all actually all industries right yeah all got it okay all industries um and then we're gonna do and you're gonna be both admin users yeah it sounds like do you will you have any other admin users probably eventually but right this second it's just us okay got it Let's see. And I already did all the, I logged in and played around with it, and I gave her and I all the access to everything. Oh, perfect. That'll be great. Okay, and then there's, yeah, which operating system do you use, or do you use different operating systems, Windows or Mac? Windows. Both Windows. Okay, excellent. What about browser? Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge? So I was asking, I was just talking about that. So the default browser here is Edge, but we can use Chrome. So I'm using Chrome to open PC Recruiter, which I know is for use. So, yeah, we can we're compatible with either one. So if you feel more comfortable on Edge or Chrome, it doesn't matter either way. Okay. So, yeah, it's just Safari, which you wouldn't even worry about. Being on a Windows is a little less compatible. Okay. Who is your email provider? Whoa. Office 365 or Gmail? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's what we're on. Yeah, Office 365. Yeah. Oh, nice. Okay. Excellent. So it's through Microsoft. Do you intend to use a bulk email provider? We have a lot of customers using a service like SendGrid to handle the bulk emails. You still create all the email campaigns and the content subject lines in PCR, but then you just kind of have your relay it over to someone like SendGrid so that they increase deliverability. make sure you don't get into any trouble with someone like Office 365 by sending too many bulk emails at once. Is that something you'd be interested in? Ashley, did you do bulk emails? No, I didn't. But, I mean, we weren't doing, like, campaigning at all. I don't know if that's something we'll eventually use. I don't think we, right now. Not at first. Okay. Got it. No problem. Let's see. And then what type of third party integrations will you be using? Things like ZoomInfo, HireEasy, LinkedIn? LinkedIn, definitely. OK. Awesome. ZoomInfo we may have because Eisner Amper has a ZoomInfo account that we could tap into, but I don't know if we would integrate that into PCRecruiter. Ashley, did you guys integrate ZoomInfo with the PCRecruiter at Markham? No, we didn't. Everything was manual. Okay. Gotcha. Is that because we were too cheap over there or we just didn't do it? We honestly don't know. I don't even know. We just, I don't think it was just ever integrated. All right. Yeah. So they, ZoomInfo has a integration that they've built. And if you're, I think you have to be a certain level. I don't know the different tiers of payment structure over at ZoomInfo, but as long as you have an account with them, you could always ask the rep about the PCR integration. I think the one they built will allow you to export names in bulk over to PCR to create name records. Okay. But definitely LinkedIn. We love the capture. Love it. Excellent. Right, Ashley? Yeah. Perfect. Okay. And then do you have anything that you want to get into your database currently? A list of names, like a CSV file, a pile of resumes you want to import. Ashley's got some stuff. But it's manually written out of our context, so we'll probably\u2026 I have an intern that's going to probably manually answer all that. Gotcha. Okay. All right. Yeah. I'll just check the box next to importing in case we want to explore that option and we can train on the import process. And then would you like to include in your training covering what we call profiles in PCR? Just another word for questionnaires where you can send questionnaires as data collection forms to either candidates or clients. I have no idea. I don't even think we ever use that. No. Okay. All right. We could just maybe do a quick overview. And then if you decide that's something that would be useful after I just show you a little bit about it, then we can fully train on it. Otherwise, we'll just give you a preview of it. Okay. Okay. I think, oh, yeah. Last question here. Job board. That's a feature that's part of your PCR package where you can, when you create a position in PCR, you can have it appear on your website so that applicants can apply and create name records for themselves. Is this something that you want to use? Yes, eventually. We don't have a website yet. Our website is just a subpage of Eisner Amper. I mean, we still could have it go to there. And then we also could have it swept to LinkedIn, right? I believe we're doing that as well. I don't remember. Yeah, there is hosting compatibility with LinkedIn. So, yeah, we can explore that. And then I'll just write that you intend to use the job board, but maybe you don't have a website exactly just yet. OK. Right. All right. I think that's everything I need. Oh, wait, it's yelling at me that I missed a question. One second. Sorry. Oh, yeah. There we go. I was just asking if you planned to use the reports and analytics at all. Yeah. Yeah. Once we get to that, yeah, we could definitely train on that, I imagine. Okay. Perfect. All right. So let's get to scheduling. We like to schedule the first four trainings, get them on the calendar if we can. And then if something comes up, very easy to just, you know, reschedule on my end if you just want to shoot me an email. So these aren't set in stone or anything if something comes up. But let's see. How spread out do you want them to be? We usually like to have a day in between. Some people like to have more days in between, like only doing two a week or one a week, totally up to you. But we usually like to put a day in between just so you have a day to play around with what we learned and talked about. Let's see. So I have availability throughout the mornings, the 1130 Eastern slot starting Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. 26, 27? 7th? Yeah. Would any of those days work for an 1130 AM? Ashley, the 26 at 1130 works for me. Does that work for you? Oh, yeah. Today's Ashley's first day, so she's perfect. Gotcha. Okay. All right. Cool. We could definitely do the 26 at 1130. That would be great. Awesome. And then maybe we'll take a look at the following week. We are open Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Gotcha. Yeah, and I have both morning slots. I either have 10 a.m. or 11.30 a.m. on all three of those days. Ashley, what's good for you? Literally, I can do any. Yeah, so 11 a.m. would be perfect if you could do that. Okay, yeah, let's do 11 a.m. Do you want it on Monday the 30th and we can even do Wednesday or. Yeah, Brian, you want to do Monday and Wednesday so you can get it going on Monday. The 30th. I am not available. Oh, then. Okay. But Tuesday I could do. Okay. Yeah. Let's do Tuesday. You said 11 a.m. Yeah. And you're going to send out these these things. You're going to send out meeting requests. Exactly. Yep. Great. Okay. Perfect. So I don't have to worry about putting it on the calendar. Perfect. And there's. And with me, you said you'll just Brian, we'll just have to forward it. Yeah, you could forward it or actually just give me your email address now and I can just include both of you. That'll be easier. Cool. It's literally just going to be my first name, Ashley.Malchuk. Okay. At iceandamper.com. Perfect. All right. And then, okay, so we got those two. We could try it if you want. We could squeeze in one on Wednesday or we can wait till after the break to do a third one. Whatever, whatever. I mean, like, again, we we're fairly familiar with the operational piece. We just what we're looking to do is really get all of our like pipeline stuff set up and how we want to go through it. Right. Ashley, if you disagree, say so, but I think we should get it all over with quicker, sooner than later. I'm with you. Yeah, let's do it. Okay. Yeah, let's do one on Wednesday then. Would you prefer 10 a.m., 1130? That's Wednesday the 2nd? Yes. Ashley, you pick. It doesn't matter to me. You want to do just 10 a.m., Brian? Fine, perfect. Perfect. Perfect. And then let's just get one more on the calendar. The following week, I'm basically wide open on the following week. So, I could do morning or afternoon. I'm out of the office the 9th, 10th, 11th, so the 7th or the 8th works. Okay. I have morning on both of those days, and then I have afternoon on the 7th. Ashley, choose. Want to do the afternoon on the 7th, just in case we can regroup before you head out, Brian? That's fine. And also, you have child care, so I want to make sure that you're fine. Oh, they're in daycare every day all day. Oh, I see. So we're good. Okay, perfect. Okay, cool. 7th, I have 2.30 p.m. or 3.30 p.m.? Choose, Ashley. I don't care. Let's do 2.30. Perfect. Awesome. All right. I'll send out four invites. They'll be hour trainings each. And like I said, if something comes up, it's not a problem. just let me know and we'll reschedule. And then on those trainings, you're going to show us how to do the Outlook plugin and all that stuff? Yeah. Yeah. The first one, we'll make sure everything's set up with usernames and each one of the pieces you want to integrate with like Outlook and Capture for LinkedIn. It'll be kind of the boring one first. And then Jim, if you have access to how Markham did it, because I basically designed the Markham piece. So if you have access to that and there's anything that you can let us know what they're doing because those are my best practices, I'd appreciate that. I don't know that we really have any access to their database. Yeah, I don't have access to their database. We can't get in for security purposes. So we don't have anything like that, unfortunately. But that's good because that means we can't go into your database for any reason. So that's good. I'm not hiding anything. I really just wanted to know. like what the process was because Ashley and I now are gonna now define the process and create the process from the ground up. And according to Ashley, it worked. I just, maybe there was some other information in there that we probably might not need. So I just wanted to make sure that we were doing everything strategically. That's all. For sure. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool, I think that's everything I need. Anything else? Any other questions for me? Anything else you wanna mention, Jim? No, that is it. That's all I needed to cover. Okay, and Jim, just when the time comes to add people, I just email you and then we just do it? Yeah, just email me. You can go ahead and actually add the usernames anytime you're ready. But email me, let me know their name and their email. I put in a ticket to adjust the billing, and then from there, if you need assistance adding users or anything I can help if needed but I like to leave it open so you're free to do it anytime you're you're ready yeah I literally changed the admin name to mine I added Ashley and now there's a template as well so there's three there's two users but the third is called template okay don't forget complete or non-billable we're good all right we're perfect now thank you guys appreciate Ashley anything else anything else nope that was it Excellent. All right. I'll send out those invites and I will talk to you on the 26th. Thank you, everybody. Appreciate it. Thanks. All right. Bye.",
