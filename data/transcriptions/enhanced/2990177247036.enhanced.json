  "transcript_text": "Thank you for calling PC Recruiter. This is Mike. Hey, Mike. It's Jenny with Sandia's Executive Search. How are you? Good, you? Good, good. Hey, I have a mystery I need help solving. I disabled an old recruiter's PCR account. However, we're still getting notices from PCR saying, hey, your RingCentral session has expired. Please log into PC Recruiter and re-authenticate. And I'm wondering how to get those to stop. Not sure. Let's see. Which database? Construction. Construction. I took out his phone number and stuff on Friday, hoping that would fix it, but it did not. So then the user, which one is it? Eric, E-R-I-K. All right. Give me a minute. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. So is it that you have access now to Eric's email address and you're getting the notifications? Yes, it's being any of his emails are being forwarded to the recruiter that's covering for him. Let me ask my colleagues, hold on a second. Okay, cool. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm trying to see if either you need to delete the user or I don't know if there's a way well I'm going to see if there's a way maybe I don't know how we would be able to delete that connection. I don't know if the user needs it. Can the user be deleted or are you looking to just keep it for whatever reason? We prefer not to. We've never had to before so I'm hoping there's a workaround but I mean that guy wasn't here this long anyway so if we had to but... What about a filter on the emails being received for the RingCentral? Just to send it to the trash of the email yeah I mean we could set a rule to like avoid it going into his inbox but if there's yeah so we can figure out a workaround if there's not like a solution I guess other than that let me see because I logged in as Eric I can see you know the kind of reauthentication needed but I don't have a way of saying cancel I don't know of a way so that's why I'm saying if my colleagues know of a way yeah I just thought it was odd because if his accounts disabled there shouldn't be anything coming from there to my knowledge correct yeah Thank you. All right, it seems like everyone's busy. I got an email. Are you admin, ad? Yes. Okay. So once I get a response back, I'll send you an email with what I find out. Perfect. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate you. Yep. You're welcome. All right. Take care. Bye.",
