  "transcript_text": "Greetings. You've reached Bob Meissner's cell phone. Kindly leave a message. Thank you. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Good afternoon, Bob. It's Jim Lombardo with the PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. I got your email and your voicemail. I wanted to return that and just kind of touch base confirm receipt. Let you know. I hate to see you go, but I wish you the best of luck. And I will go ahead and get a ticket in queue to get your cancellation underway. So we can get that closed down. I'm trying to find the email here. So we can close that down. Did you need a return? Did you need a backup of the database at all? If so, let me know and I can provide that. I think there's a $175 cost to get it and they make it available to download if you wish. But if not, I will close it. It looks like any agreement you had was six months. It's up in July, so you should be all set there. No early termination at all. I'll go ahead and get the ticket in. Give me a quick call. We'll touch base before everything's shut down. I'm going to make it like the end of this month, the 27th-ish, maybe the 30th. I'll make the cancellation date so it'll properly shut down that day before it would auto renew in July. My direct line is 440-856-0314. please reach out if there's anything that we need. If we don't speak, it's been a pleasure having you as a customer. I appreciate it over the years and I wish you the best of luck. You take care, Bob. Okay, bye bye.",
