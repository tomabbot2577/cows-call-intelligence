  "transcript_text": "Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello, this is Mark. Can you hear me this time? Hey. Hey, sorry. Yes, it is. I don't know what happened there. I literally sounded like the Verizon dude in the commercial. I'm like, hello. Hello, can you hear me? Hello. I could hear you. You couldn't hear me for some reason. I'm plugged in. Plugged in my headset back in. How are you? All good. Good, lady. How have you been? Pretty good. Pretty good. I'm so happy to be back with you guys. So, yeah, what happened? Where did you go? Like, what do you mean? Like, what happened? Refresh my memory. I've been in, like, a whirlwind lately, I feel like. Okay, so do I. So we went with, we tried another ATS-CRM combination thing that just, you know, it was one of those where, you know. Pretty demos. Pretty demos. And, hey, this is how we do it. And, yes, we can do that. And, yes, we can do that. And yes, we can do that. Yeah, we hear that a lot. Sure. And then we got to the implementation and they're like, oh, well, you have to do this to do that. We're like, whoa. You know, like here's the thing, Robin, you've known me a long time. I'm pretty direct. I'm direct enough that people actually don't like me sometimes. And I'm okay with that because at least we all know what page we're going to be on. And when I tell you I need A, B, C, and D, and you tell me I can do A, B, C, and D, and then we try A, B, C, and D, and it turns to X, Y, and Z, now I'm not happy. Now shit's going the wrong way. What did you guys look at? Smart search. Oh, I didn't know that. Oh. Yeah. I heard of that one. Yeah. And so, you know, it just didn't, you know, it just got messy there and stuff. Yeah. A lot of these newer ones, that one I've never heard of. They look so good in a demo. But that's like once you get in there, it's like, yeah, they're not really doing too much. and they're overselling integrations and they're charging a lot more too. Well, the cost-wise wasn't that bad, honestly. Oh, some of them are like, yeah. Yeah, I can imagine. But price-wise, it wasn't horrible. But it was just the fact that it came down to this situation where, like an example of it, you know how all your name records are integrated? We have name records, position records, and then company records. On this one, for me to do my sales side, it was a separate name record from people. You know who else does that? It's Bullhorn. Is that how they do it? Yeah, so it was a total cluster. It was a total cluster because we're sitting there going, okay, well, I reached out to Robin, but then she also got an email from somebody else because they're not connected, and we couldn't see the and it's like wait a second how is that possible I guess like Bullhorn because we've had some people convert they get a little eh as they go through the conversion because they have duplicate records and it's like well Bullhorn makes two records one's like a candidate view and one's a client view and it's a mess and it's like we just put it all on one record you could talk to Any conversation can flip from one to the other in 10 seconds of a call. Correct. Correct. And then we can also track and know, hey, this is somebody's customer. Like, don't freaking go recruit them directly. Right. Yeah. I don't understand why some of those systems do that, I guess. I don't know. I guess it's separating your activities, but I don't know. I don't understand it. But I know it's been an issue with a couple conversions that we've done to us. Because then they're like, okay, you merge all these? that's like, no, they're two different records. We're not going to... You have to go through each one and merge them. We don't do that for merging. And then we had, like when we did the initial conversion over, like, if I had you at four different companies and you were a hiring contact at four different companies, you would turn around and be in the system four different times because you were attached to position records that way, and we couldn't remove you. Be attached to a position? you were attached to a position in a different company. Like let's say you hired somebody, a PC recruiter from me, then you hired somebody from Bullhorn from me, and then whatever Oracle from me. You would be in the system three different times because you were the hiring contact on it. It was just \u2013 Yeah, like ours is very relational, which is also why you can only put a person in one company, but you can link them to any position because we just use the ID there. Yeah. Oh, wow. That's an \u2013 Yeah. Anyway, the reason we do things the way we do then. Right. Yes. But so the reason I was calling you is we got this invoice for nine 50. Right. And I'm trying to understand what was this. There was like a nine 50 training charge on the original contract that I thought we were not getting billed. So this was so this was let me pull it up again. So I was told to create an invoice. Let me see what the ticket was. It was a setup for your upgrade, and we did it separately. So there was one for the users. The contract, you'd have to probably review with Jim. You need to be invoiced for the setup, which is for your upgrades, and I guess you're getting training with that fee as well. And then we also changed your monthly invoice. So instead of doing one invoice or two, I just made, I adjusted your next recurring. And then I made a separate that's just for the setup. But that's going to include the training time that they're supposed to be giving you as well. Okay. Okay. Now, with that, though, when we created it, because you're in Ohio, usually, like, our Ohio customers are invoiced, but apparently not when it's training. So I made the mistake of applying the tax with that. But that's not \u2013 so I was corrected by our bookkeeper. So I was like, no, you don't do for those kind of things. I said, okay. She was asking, like, how much to set up. I'm like, I didn't take the tax off all of it. So, like, the monthly surplus still is taxable. But this part wasn't. So that's why I reached out because I guess the person, Maggie's out. She's a billing email. Correct. so she's on maternity leave yeah so she hasn't looked at it now if you want i can go into the invoice you are enabled for auto pay with a card that ends in 2054 because right now it's just kind of sitting and nothing's happening so dj does invoicing he does our accounts receivable accounts payable so he was included on an email from robert after this morning but then i was included as well and when I saw the invoice, I'm like, wait a second, because I was under the impression that we weren't getting this invoice, that we weren't going to be invoiced for this yet. That's why I was questioning it. Yeah, there was a ticket that was created under Robert's name, and it also had they signed to upgrade their PCR package and also to add some users. They've signed the agreement and now to be invoiced for the nine, the setup of nine 50. What's the, what's the upgrade of what would you know what we're getting upgraded on? I guess new features. Let me see if I can find that thing. Hold on one second. Cause when the owners keep calling me and every time he calls me, I've been on the phone. Hold on. Let me just. Let me see if I can see. Let's see. How can I see what's in that agreement? Yeah, I kept the two invoices separate, though, instead of doing one because they have to be billed anyway. You're getting premium plus with PCRM. We have to upgrade all that. I don't know if you list training hours in this, too. Let me see if they include that. I don't even know if they do. That one I thought was broken out separately. Well, this might be that. It might be the setup and those trainings together. That might be what it is. I'm trying to see if I can tell in here what exactly is in here. I got you. It just says. Yeah, the invoices are the user fee is separate. I don't know if he detailed in here. I'll have to reach out. I guess Brian Kane was your salesperson. I'll probably need to get Brian to confirm exactly what this means. I would assume it's for the upgrade, the added, like getting all the added features and stuff. But I assume from the wording on the ticket. New monthly. Okay. oh maybe it is trading or maybe it's not it just says 950 for the setup and then their new monthly rate will be 125 per user so i didn't do one invoice for the for the user that's separate so that's why the separate 950 um okay Okay, I'm going to tag Brian Cain in this ticket. Can you reach out to Mark Morick to explain what exactly 950 set up the covers? but I don't know I think I and even in the original invoice I think I put the word trading they're like well is it trading I'm like I don't even know it actually just said set up so I don't really share well but and then here's the other thing Robin is that we've already set up like what do we I'm not to be a stickler but we're already we're already set up for you guys like what are we what are we getting charged for again to but they see our end yeah when is but when is that going live sorry i mean well i think it's available to people and then it was going to be like the the full premium package like sequencing analytics all of that stuff gotcha okay cool well if it's ready to roll that's fine if that's what if that's what this the 950 is then that's fine yeah so let me find let me have him reach out to you No, that's okay. We're good. We're good. That works for me. Okay? Not an issue. Okay. I just wanted to see what it was going. Everything else good? Yeah, everything's perfect. All right, cool. Well, look, hopefully we can catch up soon. All right? I'm always here. All right. Thanks, Robin. I appreciate it. All right. Bye. Bye.",
