  "transcript_text": "Please hold while I try to connect you. Robert speaking. Hi, Robert. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Hey, how are you? I'm good. So I have a question for you. Well, actually, a couple things. Okay. So we sent you an invoice for your upgrade. Okay. For your new features, it was going to include some training as well. Yes. Okay. Okay. So with that invoice, we mistakenly applied tax. We removed it because you are in Ohio, but that type of service should not be taxed. So we removed the tax. That only applies to your monthly. So that was our mistake. Okay. And we re-sent it. I just want to know, do we have the right billing email address? I don't know. And Vaughn Johnson at Cersei Mourik? Is that who you should be using? Yeah, but she's on maternity leave right now. So do me a favor. Do you have Mark's email address, right? Oh, I'm sure I have it somewhere. The invoice is still open because I know we had Eileen Follenkamp before. So it's been changed. Do you have my email address? I can put it as yours if you want. No, I don't want it as mine. I don't, but I will. Okay, and I have it. If you send it to me, I will send it to the folks who are taking care of this when Maggie's out. And you'll get, so just put, you owe us money, and here's everything updated. Well, here's the other thing I could do, though. Hold on one second. Let me pull it up just to make sure here. Sure. It looks like you do have auto pay enabled with a card ending in 2054. If you want, because we would need this invoice paid before, it's kind of been like sitting and waiting. I could just auto pay that one invoice and that way we move forward with getting the upgrades going if that's okay with you I wanted to ask you first um I I have DJ I'm not managing that so like I said but it'll get done today like I'll have somebody reach out to you today okay um does that help you yeah I don't know any like I'm a moron when it comes to this stuff but I mean But if I send an email, it'll get done. Okay. Yeah, because the \u2013 And I will copy you on the email. Okay. Yeah, so the card, if they want to use AutoPay, is $20.54, and all they have to do is literally click a button. Gotcha. I just didn't want to do it without asking you. No, no, no, it's okay. I guess if you just send an email, I'll copy you on the response for everything. Okay, let's see. If I do it this way, if I go invoice \u2013 Just tell us what to do. I'll make sure. Yeah, DJ who does it, he just had a kid on Monday, and then Maggie had a kid on Tuesday. That's awesome. Yep. All right, so here's what I'm going to do. We pay our bills. Oh, I know. The people who are in charge of it, they're having too many kids. Okay. All right, so I'm going to send this to you just so you see it. Is that what you said, that the tax has been removed? Okay. So there's really like two things. That's fine. was caught to me by our accounting person like this was not such a tax I'm like oh okay we moved it so I just resend it to you make sure let me make sure I get it give me one second as a pop yet let's see if you take a moment I want to make sure it's not junk as well. Is it like a real email, or do you have to go through a guest system to do it? I sent it through Billard Genie, which is our new billing system. And then it'll come from billing at main sequence dot net. I got nothing on the screen. I got nothing yet. Hmm. All right, sericea at sericeamwork.com. Let me just take a moment. Yeah, that's what I sent it to you. I did it as a CC. Okay. Here, I'll just do it this way. I'll download it. I'll just use a PDF. something hold on this directly from my email then all right so give me one second forward it so what is your email address is it sent out here is it uh or just a billing it can we copy that email you could just send it to me which is robin at main sequence that met hello see if this email popped to you No. Okay.
