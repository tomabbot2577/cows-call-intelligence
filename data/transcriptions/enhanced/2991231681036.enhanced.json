  "transcript_text": "Hello, this is Brian. Hey, Brian. This is Rob Peskin calling. How are you? Good, Rob. What's going on? I had a quick question for you. I'm a customer of yours already. I just merged two candidate profiles together that shouldn't have been merged. Do you know how to reverse that? It cannot be reversed. it can't be reversed okay i figured that might be the uh the problem okay were they not the same people they are not the same people just the same name so i was trying to figure out if there was a reversal but yeah but there is not one now let me give you a couple pieces of of uh let me give you some hints here okay real quick as you called yeah um go to the tune go to the name that you selected as the master and when you go to that name record in the lower screen you have those two menus one is is icons and one is words the the menu that starts with edit name and his words you may or may not have it pinned but there's an option there underneath that menu for change log. Let me know if you see that. Okay, click on the change log. So that's going to tell you everything that got updated in that individual's record. It won't, so you will be able to see old information and the current information. You could manually recreate a record, not the activities and so forth but the contact information yeah i have it's not that big of a deal i have okay the right guy the right guy was the um the one that was merged is the one that's the most active the other one was old so i just was curious if there was a reversal and i'll recreate the other one that's no big deal got it all right cool so if i do if i do a capture let me just try and do this real quick okay this should be good all right all right yeah all right that's good to know be more careful yeah if you go find the guy that got yeah if you go find the guy that got deleted so to speak in the merge on linkedin it re-import his you know capture recapture his profile and then add whatever in protein should be good to go All right, man. I'll let you go. I appreciate it. You bet. No problem.",
