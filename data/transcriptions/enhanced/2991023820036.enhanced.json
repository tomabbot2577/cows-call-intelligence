  "transcript_text": "Hi, this is Scott. Hello, Scott. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, Jim. I'm doing pretty good. How about you? I am well. I just wanted to give you a quick call. Just to make sure, about a little over an hour ago, you got an email from Mackenzie to confirm that the data was moved. So I just wanted to make sure you were now using your database under the Z group. You know what? I couldn't get on there. Hold on. It wasn't on there a little while ago. Okay. Let me go over here. She said it could take up to 24 hours. Okay, let me see. I just, oh, well, I was able to log in. Let me see what database, what data might be in there. If I just look at a blank names, 178,000 names. So it looks like probably most of it's there, if not all. Yeah, I can't, you know what, I'm logging on to it using the administrator password I had. That ZRG that he emailed to you? Yeah. Yeah, make sure you didn't get a space at the beginning of it. Sometimes that pops in because I got right in using that. Like I'm logged in looking at it, and it looks like everything's there, 35,000 or so companies. Yeah, that's exactly what it is. Yeah, I already had it saved, and when I log in to the admin, I'll tell you exactly what the yeah it's the admin and I use that Z group uppercase arrow up four eight seven six and I still can't I don't see ya yeah I copied it right off the password and it got me right in and you only want that Let me try and copy that password and do that. Yeah, and you can change it once you get in the first time if you wish. Or you could go in under the system. I think all your users are there, but what he does is he resets them all to that password. And then from there, you might delete these other users, change your SSRally1 to a new username that you'll be \u2013 or a new password that you can recall or something like that. Yeah, see, I'm not \u2013 hold on. let me click on this site here when it says this site's trying to open controller loader allow that oh yeah i love it yeah because you'll need the control pack the controller the launcher i think it's called yes yeah i went right on the link she sent me use the same the same uh username and password and i don't have anybody i always i see a sample manager that's it uh then i go to company it says main sequence candidate pool sample client that's that hit search leave everything blank and hit search and that should do it hold on one second I think I just saw it all company name 35,000 that's it that's it yeah you might have to go into it it It didn't hold over like your, your previous late viewed records or anything like that. So that's one thing to be aware of. So this is it. So work in here, don't go into the other one anymore. Cause it's going to be shut down and deleted. And obviously anything you put in there wouldn't be included, but you're here. Can we still look over to that just to get ideas of what, how we want to set this one up? Well, it's open and it should be just whenever Barry closes at probably the end of this month. So I think we're going to leave it for another week. Just make sure you don't add anything to it. um no i won't how do i change the password now that i'm in here do you know how to do that yeah you can go to the system the little gear icon in the main menu bar at the top okay and go to users and then manage users and you're going to see all of the different user names you have in there you can delete them out as needed but if you go into your s zarelli one you can even update that so you have full permission there so that's an admin so you could update that password to whatever you want it to be and then from here forward you could log in under as the rally and the password you give it here to update the password just put the new password in the password and verify password fields and click the Save icon in the upper right hand corner hold on one second can you hear me Jim I had to put you on speaker so I'm in that drop-down box right now I got all the usernames Blake Hall Barry Smith Mark Stein can I delete those users or yeah yeah you can delete them any of them that aren't going to be used so yeah you can delete any of those so what I'm going to change the password right now the one I'm using sets admin correct yes now I go to s the rally and then go to what security yeah no right in there in a section there should be a password a password field it doesn't I don't see that let's see so underneath where your name is so when you click on your name so click on the SRL II in the bottom portion it should open the user record there yeah and there's a there's a security section it may be a gray bar that you need to click to open that's where is the username and the password I click the security user cannot change password hold on okay sorry man I'm clicking on as a rally and then I'm on information contact information but that's not the one go to security information you're saying yeah mm-hmm I gotcha hold on let me change that yeah if you change that and then hit the Save icon I can do this at a later time too right yeah oh yeah anytime I would just keep the admin password as it is just for now until you go in under your S0LE with the new password, make sure it works. And you can delete any of those other usernames you wish. Just go into them, and the same place you click the Save icon, there's a little red trash can icon that will let you delete the username if needed. And I could probably have \u2013 I could do this walking through with Garrett or somebody. I saw when I signed the agreement, I had a little bit of time to work with somebody. Yep, and I'm going to put the ticket in today so we can get assigned a trainer. They would be able to help you walk through this and any other questions because this is likely something you maybe didn't do a lot in the past. so they can do that. I don't want to say something up, but I know how I want it set up. Is there a way to request Garrett or no? Yeah, I can put that in there. I can request him. And as long as he's got some openings, they should be able to get that for you. Awesome. Yeah, I dealt with him before. He was really good. Very good. Yeah, he's the best. I like him. So what I'll do, I will put the ticket in. He can help with that. You are good to go. And the other database is open, the NIT. That will be open for a little while. I'll talk to Barry because he's the signer, so we'll see when he wants to cancel it. but I'm pretty sure he said we'll leave it through the end of the month. Yeah, let's leave it to the end of the month. I'm sure he'll be good with that. And then with the ticket for Garrett, he'll just reach out to me with his availability? Yeah, I don't know if he'll \u2013 he probably won't have an initial consulting call with me since you're an existing user. Normally, with a new customer, we would have an initial call. We would go over how they want \u2013 like a whole bunch of questions, but you're very familiar. You just have a couple hours if you need it. He'll probably just reach out and get something set up there. Okay, or I could even hit him with an email. Awesome, yeah. I won't take too much of this time. I already know how to use this thing. Okay. Very well. I appreciate it, man. We're up and running. Thank you so much. Not a problem. All right. All right. We'll talk soon. Bye-bye.",
