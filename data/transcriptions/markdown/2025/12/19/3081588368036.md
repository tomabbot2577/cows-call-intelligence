**[0:50] Speaker_01:** The PCR, I updated the most recent version, but now everything is going from, instead of inhaling from my Outlook to PCR, it's putting everything in bad, saying that it cannot read my stuff, my resumes.

**[1:09] Speaker_01:** So I just made sure to update my Acrobat Pro, and all of the resumes can be opened.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** So I'm not exactly sure why it can't read them, but I'll give you a call back after I get off of this call, and we can see.
