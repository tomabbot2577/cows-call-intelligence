## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** This is Amy Roch with Edna Rice Executive Recruiters.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** You actually had left me a message this morning following up on a voicemail from Friday.

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** How's it going?

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** Are you still having issues with PCR?

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** Yes.

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** Actually, I just have a question, and I need help on a search.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** So we have a, what I thought was a, what's it called, a custom field called current company under company information.

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** And I need to search that current company.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** But for some reason, when I go to advanced, it's not under the custom fields.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** Let me take a look.

**[0:47] Speaker_00:** Which database are you in?

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** Edna Rice Final?

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** The Final.

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** Okay, perfect.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** And what's your username?

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** A-R-O-C-H.

**[0:58] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[1:00] Speaker_00:** All right, so jump into a name search.

**[1:03] Speaker_00:** Oh, wait, is it company search?

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** Are you looking for name records with this custom field or companies?

**[1:10] Speaker_01:** No, names.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** Names, that's what I thought.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** Name, custom field, I'm looking for company.

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** It's actually current company.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** So if I look up under the predefined field, if I look up company, then that brings up a company name.

**[1:29] Speaker_01:** That brings up where at the top where it says candidate default, or that's if they're assigned to a company.

**[1:35] Speaker_01:** But we don't have most of our candidates assigned to a company.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** We have them all under candidate default.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** So we had created this current company where we type in where they're working, and I can't find that field.

**[1:46] Speaker_01:** I can't find that.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** Oh, I know what happens.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** So your searching has been customized to only show specific fields for your username.

**[1:57] Speaker_00:** And I can show you how to adjust that.

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** So just go to start by going to name in the main menu of VCR.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** And then at the top right, go to the customize action button.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** It's a gear icon in the top frame.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** Like where it says basic search?

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** Wait, what?

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** Top right, yeah.

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** So basic search on that same line that it says basic search all the way to the right.

**[2:26] Speaker_00:** There's a gear icon.

**[2:27] Speaker_00:** It might not on the right.

**[2:28] Speaker_01:** It's on the left right next to it, but that's fine.
