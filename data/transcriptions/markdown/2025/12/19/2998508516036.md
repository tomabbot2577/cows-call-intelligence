**[0:06] Speaker_01:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** I have a billing question, and there wasn't really an option for billing, so hence, I have you.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** Yeah, no problem.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** Let me transfer you over to billing.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** One second.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** It looks like they're already on a call currently.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** I can transfer you over to Robin's voicemail.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** She's head of the billing department, and she can get back to you as soon as possible.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** And I'll also just leave a message for her.

**[0:43] Speaker_01:** Let me see here.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** What was the company you said you were with?

**[0:47] Speaker_00:** Action Management Services.

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** I think I tell you, is there a Monica or something like that?

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** No.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** Yeah, no Monica here.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** Maybe it was Robin that I talked to last time.

**[1:01] Speaker_01:** Oh, yeah, could be.

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** Yeah, no worries.

**[1:04] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'll just send you over to her voicemail and then let her know that you called.
