**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** Gary Boza.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** How are you doing?

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Thank you.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** Hey, listen, I can't seem to be able to open or add notes in PCR.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** It goes to the note field, but the plus sign doesn't come up, and I can't get in.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** I could see old...

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** So over at the left, there's a little box for adding a note.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** There's a plus sign.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** Or let me see.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** How is it looking?

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** Hold on one second.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Give me one second.

**[0:47] Speaker_00:** So did you go to the name record and then go to the notes tab, or do you have it on your front screen?

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** You went to the tab?

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** I'm on a gal by the name of Jamie Miller.

**[1:02] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:03] Speaker_00:** So if you go to the notes tab, it'll show your existing notes.

**[1:08] Speaker_00:** And at the top left, there's a plus sign.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** And then just to the right of that, a search box.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** It's not showing me my notes.

**[1:16] Speaker_01:** It's just underlined.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** I click on it and nothing happens.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** I'm not sure.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** So there should be like a plus sign.

**[1:27] Speaker_00:** Do you have it on your front screen?

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** Let's see here.

**[1:34] Speaker_00:** Or are you in the notes tab?

**[1:37] Speaker_01:** Okay, I'm on my front screen.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Okay, do you have notes in there or did you go to the notes tab?

**[1:42] Speaker_01:** Yeah, it's either way.

**[1:45] Speaker_01:** I mean, if I'm at my front screen, I press on notes, it clicks.

**[1:50] Speaker_01:** It underlines the word notes, but that's it.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** No plus sign, no showing of all notes, nothing.

**[1:58] Speaker_01:** I mean, I'm familiar with the plus sign.

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** I use it all the time.

**[2:01] Speaker_01:** There's no plus sign.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** I can share my screen if you want to see it.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** I've been having this problem for a few days now.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** I wonder if your security has changed.

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** Let's see.

**[2:23] Speaker_00:** MR Chicago Northwest.

**[2:28] Speaker_00:** What database are you in?

**[2:30] Speaker_00:** There's MR Chicago Northwest, default database, and resume inhaler.
