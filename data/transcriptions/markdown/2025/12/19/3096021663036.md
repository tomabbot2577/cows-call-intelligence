**[0:11] Speaker_02:** So what can we do?

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** So what is the issue you're having?

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** You have certain databases that you cannot access.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** Is that correct?

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** And, okay, do you have contact with any of those admin users anymore?
