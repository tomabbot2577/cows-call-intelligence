## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** This call may be recorded for quality assurance.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** Classic Chevy service, this is Travis.

**[0:25] Speaker_01:** I'm going to help you.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** Hey Travis, this is Jim Lombardo.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** I had a question for you.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** I was going to stop out and pick up my key to my locked wheel hubs tomorrow.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** And what times are you open tomorrow?

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** We'll be here from 645 to 3 o'clock.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** And my other question is, might you, while I'm going to be there anyway, be able to look at my tailgate?

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** I am having the top portion of the tailgate is randomly unlocking itself.

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** Usually if I even open the door, it just unlocks.

**[0:58] Speaker_00:** It's happening off and on, randomly.

**[1:01] Speaker_01:** I'll be honest with you, I won't be here tomorrow.

**[1:04] Speaker_01:** Brooke will be.

**[1:05] Speaker_01:** When you stop in, I would just ask her, see if they've got any time.

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** They do have a pretty booked schedule.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** I would say that should be fine.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** I don't see an issue with that.

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** And even if it's something that she says, oh, we have no time now, maybe we'll pick something later in the week and we can run it out there.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** It's just that top piece, the top part of the top latch, I guess.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** It started, if I click them both, it doesn't...

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** Honestly, I'd be honest with you, it's most likely the button.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** And even if you had it replaced, I would even tell you it's probably most likely the button.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** They seem to have a lot of problems with them, but...

**[1:42] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** I will stop over some time.

**[1:45] Speaker_01:** I mean, if you wanted just to throw a button at it, too, that's up to you.

**[1:49] Speaker_01:** I mean, I can check to see if we have one in stock for you.

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** How much do they run?

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** How long does it take?

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** It usually takes about an hour just because they've got to take that back half of the tailgate off.

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** Let's see here.

**[2:02] Speaker_01:** What's a good phone number for you, sir, the one you called me off of here?

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** No, actually it will be 440-339-9107.

**[2:14] Speaker_01:** And this is on the Sierra, correct?

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** Yes.

**[2:20] Speaker_01:** Let's see if I can find this.

**[2:35] Speaker_01:** You know, honestly, this might have to be something I might have to send you over to Parts for.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** It's not showing in my service parts guarantee little catalog I have here.

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** It's not showing we have one.

**[2:45] Speaker_01:** But, you know, we might have one in stock.

**[2:47] Speaker_01:** And, honestly, Mr.

**[2:48] Speaker_01:** Lombardo, I would really recommend having them diagnose it just in case, you know, something maybe in like the tailgate harness is going bad, you know, just so you're not putting a button on it, wasting your money.

**[2:57] Speaker_01:** But, you know, I would just come up, talk to Brooks, see if she, if maybe she's got time, you know, maybe she will, maybe she won't.

**[3:03] Speaker_01:** But like I said, we're pretty booked up tomorrow, but a lot of times people cancel too.

**[3:07] Speaker_01:** So you never know.

**[3:09] Speaker_00:** Okay.
