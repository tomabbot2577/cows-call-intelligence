**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello?

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Hi, how's it going?

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** I have a Tom Braun calling in.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** He's from MR Northern Virgin, B-E-R-G-E-N.

**[0:12] Speaker_01:** He's like retired now.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** He just retired and he was looking to see what his options were to kind of discontinue PCR.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** I could send him your way or send him to your voicemail?

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** I would say, just since it's 5, I would say send him my voicemail if you would.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** That way I can get his info, call him tomorrow, go over the details, figure out what he wants to do, and get him squared away.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** That sounds good.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** Have a great rest of your day.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** I'll send him to his voicemail.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** I appreciate it.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** Thank you, Garrett.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** Thanks.
