**[0:29] Speaker_01:** You are in the meeting now.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** There is one other participant in the meeting.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** Good afternoon.

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** This is Jim.

**[0:38] Speaker_02:** Hey, Jim.

**[0:39] Speaker_03:** How are you doing?

**[0:39] Speaker_03:** Good afternoon.

**[0:40] Speaker_02:** I am very well, Oscar.

**[0:42] Speaker_02:** How are you?

**[0:43] Speaker_03:** I'm doing great.

**[0:44] Speaker_03:** And you?

**[0:46] Speaker_02:** I'm doing pretty well.

**[0:46] Speaker_02:** Pretty well.

**[0:47] Speaker_02:** Thanks for joining me.

**[0:50] Speaker_02:** Thank you for having me.

**[0:51] Speaker_02:** For sure, for sure.

**[0:53] Speaker_02:** So yeah, so wanted to kind of chat with you a little bit about the dimensional search process, the setup, how that goes, and next steps to get you up and running on PC Recruiter as part of your dimensional search setup and everything.

**[1:07] Speaker_02:** So basically what will happen, the first thing we need to do is get you your information.

**[1:15] Speaker_02:** I need to get your information to send over the paperwork to get you signed up on PC Recruiter.

**[1:19] Speaker_02:** As you know, $7.50 setup, $50 a user a month.

**[1:22] Speaker_02:** You're one user, are you?

**[1:26] Speaker_03:** Yep, one user.

**[1:27] Speaker_03:** I'm tracking $7.50 initial setup, and I think I'm not really clear as far as the monthly.

**[1:36] Speaker_02:** Yeah, it's $50 per user per month.

**[1:39] Speaker_02:** So since you're one user, it would be $50.

**[1:41] Speaker_02:** If you ever need to add additional users, you can do it, and it just makes it an additional $50 a month per user for that.

**[1:49] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:50] Speaker_02:** So that is there.

**[1:51] Speaker_02:** And then what would happen, I'll email that over to you.

**[1:53] Speaker_02:** It's going to come through in a PandaDoc, just like a doc you sign, just a different name brand.

**[1:57] Speaker_02:** Once you sign that, my accounting team is going to send over the invoice for the setup in the first month.

**[2:03] Speaker_02:** As soon as that's paid, within a day or so, they'll create a database link for you.

**[2:09] Speaker_02:** And it's going to be a link that will have your admin username, a password to get in.

**[2:13] Speaker_02:** That's going to be what you'd utilize for PC Recruiter.

**[2:16] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[2:16] Speaker_02:** Once we have that, we'll also assign you a PC Recruiter trainer on our end here.

**[2:21] Speaker_02:** So you'll have one coach here at PC Recruiter for 10 hours.

**[2:24] Speaker_02:** So you have 10 hours of training with us in addition to your coach and training with dimensional search.

**[2:30] Speaker_02:** So you essentially have two entities getting you trained up on the system.

**[2:34] Speaker_02:** Your trainer here at PC Recruiter is going to get you two to three hours before your dimensional search training.

**[2:39] Speaker_02:** Then they'll kind of take over and do some training.

**[2:42] Speaker_02:** And then they'll turn it back over and they'll kind of hand you off back and forth.

**[2:45] Speaker_02:** You'll do some training with PC Recruiter, training with Dimensional Search, back and forth that way.

**[2:50] Speaker_02:** Are you in the July or the August class for Dimensional Search?

**[2:54] Speaker_02:** August class.

**[2:56] Speaker_02:** August class.

**[2:57] Speaker_02:** I think, is it the 8th?
