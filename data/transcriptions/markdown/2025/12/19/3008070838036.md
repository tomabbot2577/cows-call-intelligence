## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** David Riss Hi, David.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** David Riss Good.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** David Riss I'm pretty well.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** I'm pretty well.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** I wanted to kind of reach out.

**[0:14] Speaker_00:** I jumped with you and I think also Deborah Page.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** So I wanted to kind of start with the two of you to talk a little bit about your database and see what was going on with everything.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** See if there was maybe some consideration, further consideration about moving to the cloud version of PC Recruiter.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** I just kind of wanted to follow up.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I think that we're having kind of a flat few months here.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** And the guy that is – Debra is the best one to talk to officially, but she's not going to make the decision.

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** So this is an off-the-record conversation.

**[1:00] Speaker_01:** Debra probably has the ear of Bill McCormick, who is one of the co-founders of the group, right?

**[1:10] Speaker_01:** And Bill is the one who's going to make the final decision.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** Debra is probably your best contact to get something in front of Bill.

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** But I just, I think it's going to be, yeah, it's not going to be, it's not going to be a near-term opportunity for you.

**[1:34] Speaker_00:** For sure, for sure.

**[1:35] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I was just trying to help out because there were some issues with the database growing, and I think there was a tech support person that had kind of gotten it figured out, but I don't know if he even knew there was a cloud option, and my tech support team kind of told him, like, we don't really support the self-hosted as heavily as you're asking.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Maybe you'll want to consider cloud, and he didn't know there was a cloud.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** So I was just kind of reaching out to open up a dialogue.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** See if it was kind of, as Deborah said the last time we spoke, that probably sometime, just not then.

**[2:01] Speaker_00:** So I just kind of want to do it again.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** Yeah, so that's my advice.

**[2:06] Speaker_01:** It's just not a really, we're having a bit of a flat year.

**[2:10] Speaker_01:** And so that's, you know, it's all on money coming in as opposed to money going out right now.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** Okay, okay.

**[2:19] Speaker_00:** Cool, cool.

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** So I'm also going to pop her an email.

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** Should I see, I had you CC'd if I was writing it.

**[2:24] Speaker_00:** Should I still CC you or should I leave you off?

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** That would be fine.

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** That would be fine.

**[2:28] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I'll just kind of reach out to open up a dialogue with her and see what's going on.

**[2:33] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:34] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[2:34] Speaker_01:** Well, good luck with that.

**[2:36] Speaker_01:** I never did get the – we never did get the email working, which is a head scratcher for me.

**[2:45] Speaker_01:** Yeah, you turned it over to Robin, I think.

**[2:49] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:52] Speaker_00:** I'll check on that, too.

**[2:56] Speaker_00:** because there shouldn't be an issue, but I'll check on that and see what was going on.

**[3:01] Speaker_01:** I think I need to run something because part of the problem is we turned over our desktop IP support to a third party, and they don't want to think outside the box.

**[3:22] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[3:25] Speaker_00:** Well, thank you for the call.

**[3:27] Speaker_00:** Very good.
