## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling MainSegments Technology.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** My PCR is being really funky.

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** For example, I cannot load notes.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** I just tried deleting somebody's file and I'm an admin and it won't let me.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** So something, I don't know if it's something that needs to be cleared out or if there was an update but um sure yeah it might be a clear cache I'll give you some instructions for that so just pull up PCR on the screen to start and then are you on a Google Chrome browser or I am okay good click the three dots at the top right of the browser yep go down to more tools towards the bottom yep and And then developer tools.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** That'll open up some coding and jargon.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Just kind of ignore all of that.

**[1:03] Speaker_00:** And then go up to the top of the screen to your web address, the www.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** Right-click on the refresh button to the left of that.

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** So it's the arrow and a loop.

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** And then you should have the option to empty cache and hard reload when you right-click on it.

**[1:21] Speaker_01:** so it's reload site, cancel or reload?

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Let's see.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** Did I do that right?

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** No.

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** I think you might have left clicked on it.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** Hit cancel on that pop-up you just saw, and then try right clicking on the refresh button, and you should get a drop-down to choose empty cache and hard reload.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** Got it.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** I see it.

**[1:44] Speaker_01:** Sorry.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah, no worries.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** Empty cache and hard reload, the third option, and that would...

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** Oh, and then you'll get a pop-up saying, do you want to reload PCR?

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** And do reload, obviously.

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** And that'll kind of slowly reload the page.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** And once that happens and it's fully loaded, you can close those developer tools.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** And then we'll see if you're still having that issue.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:15] Speaker_01:** It's circling.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** Okay, now it logs me out.

**[2:23] Speaker_01:** And now it's loading.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** So I can close that funky window, right?

**[2:29] Speaker_01:** Log back in.

**[2:31] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[2:32] Speaker_01:** Okay, hold on.

**[2:33] Speaker_01:** And let's see what happens.

**[2:41] Speaker_01:** Casey Phoenix.

**[2:42] Speaker_01:** Hold on.

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** What's this go to?

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** So I'm just going to see if I can delete this guy now.

**[2:49] Speaker_01:** That was one thing that I knew I couldn't do.

**[2:52] Speaker_01:** Delete record.
