## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** This is Stacy calling from Connect with Search Group.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** So we signed up for this thing called Zoom.

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** You guys are integrated with it.

**[0:17] Speaker_00:** You know, everything's fine.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** But when I go to log in, it's not letting me log in through PCR, through Zoom, through whatever.

**[0:27] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:27] Speaker_01:** Yeah, so it's the Zoom phone connection integration?

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** No, Zoom Info.

**[0:32] Speaker_01:** Oh, Zoom Info.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:35] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** Let's see.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** So you're inside of PC Recruiter, and then you're trying to log into the Zoom Info Enhance.

**[0:48] Speaker_01:** It's like the Enhance with Zoom Info?

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** Yeah, Enrich with Zoom Info.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** Step one, authenticate.

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** and then I type in my username and password through Zoom info and I go log in and it says invalid name and or password, which I know it's right because I'm logged into Zoom.

**[1:10] Speaker_01:** Okay, I see.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** And I've done the whitelist.

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** I've done, you know, everything I thought I was supposed to do, so I don't know what I'm missing here.

**[1:22] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** So do you know if you have a ZoomInfo Pro, Advanced, Elite, or Talent OS?

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** Okay, your Talent OS.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** Talent.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** Got it.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** And have you contacted your ZoomInfo representative to turn on ZoomInfo Enterprise API?

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** What is that?

**[1:44] Speaker_01:** So the feature requires something called ZoomInfo Enterprise API, and it can be enabled on your ZoomInfo account if you talk to your ZoomInfo representative.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** So basically the API is a way for PCR to talk to ZoomInfo, but that just has to be enabled on your account.

**[2:05] Speaker_01:** All right, all that.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** Because I have...

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** All right, so Talent OS post-complete.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** I mean, that's what I have is the Talent OS.

**[2:22] Speaker_00:** But here's the thing.

**[2:24] Speaker_00:** I've been exporting lists from my Zoom to PCR for the past two days.

**[2:33] Speaker_01:** Yeah, that is the integration that Zoom Info built.

**[2:37] Speaker_01:** And that one works where you can connect that way.

**[2:41] Speaker_01:** this integration that we've built, you know, it requires that you have Zoom Info Enterprise API turned on.

**[2:50] Speaker_01:** So it's like one direction, you won't need it.

**[2:55] Speaker_01:** The other direction, you will need it.
