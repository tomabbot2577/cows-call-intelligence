**[0:05] Speaker_00:** I just called you.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** I don't know if you picked up because I apparently don't know how to use a wireless headset without trampling on it.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** I'm just connecting it.

**[0:13] Speaker_02:** That's okay.

**[0:14] Speaker_02:** How are you doing?
