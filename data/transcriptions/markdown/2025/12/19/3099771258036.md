## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Hi, this is your favorite pay-in-the-ass customer, Rich.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Oh, hey, Rich.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Yeah, no problem.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** Garrett, I'm just thinking, because I'm kind of desperate, I'm talking about what if I remove PC Recruiter from my computer totally and treat it as a new, you know, and remove LinkedIn totally from my computer and start from scratch because I don't, something is there because it's on this and my laptop.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** So there's something either in Chrome, PC Recruiter, or LinkedIn.

**[0:48] Speaker_01:** And I'm thinking, what if I just started from scratch?

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, I saw your email earlier today.

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** I'm not talking about PCR capture.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** I know we did that already.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** So PCR itself isn't actually installed on your computer at all.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** There's nothing really to uninstall.

**[1:08] Speaker_00:** It's just a website that you can visit to get to your database.

**[1:13] Speaker_01:** No, but I mean, it's not, you know, like when I got a new when I got a new computer, I called you guys and you gave me a link, you know, so I can use it.

**[1:21] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** You know, that's what I mean in terms of I realize it's a web-based system, but I'm just thinking, let's say I reset everything.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** I go back like it's a brand new computer.

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** Do you think that?

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** Because I can't think of, if you guys can't think of anything, I can't think of what else could fix it.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** So even if it was a brand new computer, we would still just give you that same web link.

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** So there wouldn't be anything to like reset on that.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** And same thing with LinkedIn.

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** You would nothing to really to uninstall or anything.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** But I did.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** There is an update in the last hour or so.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** I was it looked like on my browser, I was still logged in under your LinkedIn.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** I hadn't visited LinkedIn since we last talked and got your credentials.

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** And I was able to recreate the issue this time, which I never had been able to before on my own computer.

**[2:27] Speaker_00:** So when I'm logged in under your LinkedIn profile on my computer, the little PCR button doesn't show up for me either, which is a new development that that hadn't been happening before.

**[2:40] Speaker_00:** So it seems like it might be something related to your LinkedIn log in your account, because I immediately then went to my own account on LinkedIn and the PCR capture was working on my computer.

**[2:55] Speaker_00:** So I feel like we've narrowed it down to something to do with your LinkedIn login and that account.

**[3:02] Speaker_00:** So I did pass that information along to the tech team and seeing if that opens any doors or theories up of what we can do for more troubleshooting.

**[3:13] Speaker_00:** But that definitely was a breakthrough because we weren't able to recreate that before on our computers.

**[3:19] Speaker_00:** So randomly today we were able to.

**[3:22] Speaker_00:** Oh, so I guess that's a good thing.

**[3:27] Speaker_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[3:27] Speaker_00:** I don't know why.

**[3:28] Speaker_00:** And it's funny because you did.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** I have a note here.

**[3:31] Speaker_00:** You mentioned like one day it started working for you on LinkedIn in the morning and then it stopped working in the afternoon.

**[3:39] Speaker_00:** So it seems so finicky, whatever this error is.

**[3:43] Speaker_00:** But at least we did get an instance where I can recreate it on my computer signed into your LinkedIn account.

**[3:50] Speaker_00:** So that's definitely in progress.

**[3:52] Speaker_01:** It's in my settings there, I'm assuming.

**[3:55] Speaker_00:** It could be.
