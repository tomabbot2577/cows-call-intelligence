## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Nain Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_02:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_02:** This is Erica Eichelbohm with Morgan Consulting Resources.

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** And I have a question about fixing the settings in PCR to send email notifications when we receive an application through our website.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[0:23] Speaker_00:** Let me pull up your database here.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** Morgan Consulting.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** And do you have – do you know if you have an automation already set up for that and it stopped working or you need to set up that automation?

**[0:43] Speaker_02:** We have it set up and it stopped working on May 29th for everyone.

**[0:47] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** Let's check a few things.

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** Thank you.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** Okay, that's probably where the issue is.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** So the database has an email address that it sends these emails from.

**[1:47] Speaker_01:** It's not tied to any username.

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** but it's the settings live in the system settings up at the top so let's see do you have admin access do you know to the database I don't know I don't think okay we can check if you if you go to system in the main menu of PCR look for email setup on the left?

**[2:13] Speaker_02:** Okay, system email setup, okay.

**[2:20] Speaker_01:** And then on the right, do you have an option that says outgoing mail settings?

**[2:24] Speaker_02:** No.

**[2:25] Speaker_01:** Okay, so that's something that somebody with admin access would need to change, but the outgoing mail email address lost the connection from PCR to the email provider, Office 365.

**[2:40] Speaker_01:** So Let me see what you have here.

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** The email that was plugged in is Nicole at MorganConsulting.com.

**[2:47] Speaker_01:** So that just needs to be reconnected.

**[2:50] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[2:51] Speaker_01:** Do you want me to email you those steps to get back to the...

**[2:55] Speaker_02:** Yeah, that would be great.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** Okay, perfect.

**[2:57] Speaker_02:** Can you copy Nicole at MorganConsulting.com on that email so she can reactivate?

**[3:02] Speaker_01:** Yeah, absolutely.

**[3:04] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[3:05] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[3:06] Speaker_01:** I will send that out now.

**[3:07] Speaker_01:** Any other questions that you have?

**[3:10] Speaker_01:** Any other issues?

**[3:11] Speaker_02:** Nope.

**[3:12] Speaker_02:** Oh, actually, when she reactivates her email, will it send all the former, like everything since May 29th, or will it just resume going forward?

**[3:23] Speaker_01:** It'll just resume going forward.

**[3:24] Speaker_01:** It won't do anything retroactive.

**[3:27] Speaker_02:** Okay, gotcha.

**[3:28] Speaker_02:** Okay, well, that sounds like it's going to be fixed then.

**[3:32] Speaker_01:** Yep, absolutely.

**[3:33] Speaker_01:** Just reconnecting there.

**[3:34] Speaker_01:** So, yeah, if you do have trouble, though, after I send that email, just hit reply and we can walk you through it.

**[3:44] Speaker_01:** Awesome.

**[3:45] Speaker_01:** Thank you so much.

**[3:46] Speaker_01:** Thanks.

**[3:45] Speaker_01:** Have a good one.
