## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Good morning, May.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Sequence.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** Yeah, good morning, May.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Is this Jim Lombardo?

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** This is.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Hi, Jim.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** This is Evelyn Alonso calling you from Safra National Bank.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** How are you today?

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** I am well, Evelyn.

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** Oh, good.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** Oh, good, Jim.

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** So I sent you an email yesterday.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** Let's see if we can work this out.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** Certainly.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** Certainly.

**[0:24] Speaker_01:** So, yes, let's help me, okay?

**[0:29] Speaker_01:** because for me, you know, we have to follow a process internally, right?

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** I've been back and forth with legal.

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** I ask them to please help me out, to do this, to do that.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** You know, at the end of the day, it's been difficult because they usually don't do, you know, what you're requesting on your side, right?

**[0:52] Speaker_01:** But at the end of the day, you know, I'm interested in the system, correct?

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** so let's try to work this out together.

**[1:00] Speaker_01:** Maybe when I reviewed the last corrections or the updates that they did, there were really more forms than, you know, there were not a lot of changes, right?

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** So maybe we can work something together like a draft and just I present it to them to just give me the green light so we can satisfy both parties.

**[1:27] Speaker_00:** Sure, sure.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I'll look through it and I'll see if there's any things that are like just maybe a change in name or I had a wrong address or something like that.

**[1:38] Speaker_00:** And why don't I try and pull out kind of the bulk of the changes per se that I see, throw it in a Word doc and send that over for review.

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** and I'll review and then I'll send it to my department because I just need them to say okay.

**[1:58] Speaker_01:** Right?

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** For sure.

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** So I want to make it everything very simple so we can have your side and my side in compliance and happy.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** My group just changed their procedure just because the cost got astronomical to have a legal team review everything.

**[2:16] Speaker_01:** I completely understand.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** I had a conversation, look, this doesn't make sense.

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** You know, it's a small agreement.

**[2:22] Speaker_01:** You know, we have so many changes, right?

**[2:25] Speaker_01:** Look, again, I represent the bank, but I understand how this works as well, right?

**[2:33] Speaker_01:** So at the end of the day, let's try to make this happen.

**[2:37] Speaker_01:** I'll have to make sure so we can put that.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** If you can help me putting that and maybe we can review together, that would be great.

**[2:46] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[2:48] Speaker_00:** Let me kind of put together something that I can find and then we can touch base and maybe review that together before we send it over for your team to have a look.

**[2:59] Speaker_00:** And then I'll let my team take a look as well.

**[3:02] Speaker_00:** And that's perfect.

**[3:01] Speaker_00:** That would be great.

**[3:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you so much, Jim.

**[3:01] Speaker_00:** Have a wonderful day.
