## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** Hello?

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Hi, Paul.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** It's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:09] Speaker_02:** Hi, sir.

**[0:09] Speaker_02:** Yeah, I tried to connect, and I guess you went in and got out, so I probably was a little late.

**[0:15] Speaker_02:** I apologize for missing the meeting.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** No worries.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** No worries.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I logged in.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** I usually wait for 10 minutes because sometimes it takes time and everything, and then I didn't see you, so.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** Anyway, no worries.

**[0:29] Speaker_02:** I'm sorry for wasting your time on that.

**[0:32] Speaker_02:** No, no.

**[0:34] Speaker_02:** Is there anything we can do?

**[0:35] Speaker_02:** I mean, are you still busy right now, or can we do something real quick, or you just want to reschedule?

**[0:40] Speaker_00:** We can hop in right now if you want.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** We can even just stay on the phone here, and I'll just open up the meeting.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** I'll just start the meeting, and we can just – if you hop into the Zoom, we don't need to dial in or have speakers on.

**[0:52] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** I'll just show you around a bit here.

**[0:55] Speaker_02:** All right.

**[0:56] Speaker_02:** All right.

**[0:56] Speaker_02:** Great.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** Okay, that should let me know when you're in.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** But, yeah, you want to look at the PCRM piece, the new product interface of PC Recruiter?

**[1:08] Speaker_02:** Say again?

**[1:08] Speaker_02:** I didn't hear the last part.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** So you want to look at the new PCRM, the new product interface?

**[1:13] Speaker_02:** Yeah, yes, sir.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** Yes, sir.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** That's the one.

**[1:15] Speaker_02:** Yeah, because I'm actually familiar with, you know, I told you I was using PCRNet, the actual one.

**[1:21] Speaker_02:** Is it pretty much similar?

**[1:23] Speaker_02:** It just has all that extra functionality in it?

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** Well, if it is, we will.

**[1:28] Speaker_02:** It looks different.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** So it is going to have almost all the functionality you see in your current PC recruiter and then some because it adds like a deals pipeline.

**[1:38] Speaker_00:** It adds simpler sequencing, but it looks a little bit different.

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** So we can take a look at kind of how that looks there once you're in.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Hold on a second.

**[1:53] Speaker_02:** And then, you know, yesterday you mentioned the prices, but you said like I think it was $100 and some dollars per seat for one year.

**[2:04] Speaker_02:** And is that one year you pay the full year up front, or is it a monthly?

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** Usually monthly, but you can pay the year up front.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** If you do that, we knock 5% off for an annual payment.

**[2:17] Speaker_00:** so and i just have to you know i just have to you know commit to a year though yeah yeah or you can pay monthly and just kind of pay a month at a time that's no problem there okay and then you said the setup i think with 750 in 10 hours of training and it creates the database gets everything set up for you the trainer would walk you through everything in the system show you how to use this And there's going to be some newer features in it because where you're using PC Recruiter, you all don't have the premium package, which adds email campaigns and analytics and sequencing.

**[2:54] Speaker_00:** So there are some additional things that you might see in here that you're not used to.

**[2:59] Speaker_02:** And how much would everybody have to participate in that to get that functionality?
