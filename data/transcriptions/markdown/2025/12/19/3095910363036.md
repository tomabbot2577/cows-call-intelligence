## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling me in sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hi, Robin.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** This is Susan Dufault with Strategic Ventures.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** How are you this morning?

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** I'm good.

**[0:12] Speaker_01:** Thank you.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I got an email that you have not received our payment.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** I initiated this payment on the 2nd of September, and it was through Bank of America Bill Pay, and I printed out a receipt that it was received on the 9th.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** Okay, let's see here.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** I don't actually get those myself.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** Let's go to Strategic Ventures is the company name?

**[0:41] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:49] Speaker_01:** I have the invoice number if you need it.

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** Let's see.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Maybe I haven't asked SV.

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** it might I don't know if Peter made a change to SV executive search but I think we're still getting things under strategic ventures we are okay see the invoice here can you do me a favor can you email me what you had you can just send it to billing at main sequence as far as payment and if it is something that goes directly to the bank account, I need to have our bookkeeper look into that because that's something I wouldn't have access to.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** Let me see this way.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** Unless it was applied to an older open invoice.

**[2:01] Speaker_00:** So is that billing at main sequence?

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** I'm sorry.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** Yeah, yes.

**[2:06] Speaker_01:** Billing at main sequence dot com?

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Dot net.

**[2:10] Speaker_01:** Net?

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** Yes.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** Our last payment was a check on 8-14.

**[2:17] Speaker_00:** We just sent it.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** If it goes to our post office box, we do pick those up only once a week.

**[2:24] Speaker_01:** Let me see what I have here for you.

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** I do have a PO box.

**[2:32] Speaker_00:** Yeah, a PO box like 8-05.

**[2:34] Speaker_00:** It could be that they just weren't picked up yet.

**[2:38] Speaker_00:** It wasn't deposited, right?

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** well it just it says post date okay okay because i initiated they send a check that's the first date it's available to be okay because sometimes those take a little longer to get to us when you're doing any kind of check and we don't go to the post office every day so and i know normally she goes on fridays to pick them up but she happened to be out of town so it could be picked up within the next couple days.

**[3:09] Speaker_00:** What I can do is if it's not in that batch, then I'll reach out to you.

**[3:14] Speaker_00:** I'll just make a note.

**[3:15] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[3:16] Speaker_01:** So I don't need to send anything to you.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** No, for now, just hold off.

**[3:20] Speaker_00:** Let me see if it's in that next batch.

**[3:21] Speaker_00:** And we'll just go from there if that's okay.

**[3:26] Speaker_01:** That's perfectly fine.

**[3:28] Speaker_01:** I appreciate that.

**[3:28] Speaker_01:** Thank you, Robin.

**[3:29] Speaker_00:** Oh, no problem.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** So I'm just going to put a little note to myself here.
