**[0:05] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Hey, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** I am calling for help with an issue with email connection.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I think I actually spoke with you yesterday.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** I'm trying to revamp an old computer that hasn't been used in a while, and I'm sure it's just a setting with some emails.

**[0:24] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** What's your name and what company are you with?

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** Okay, it's Kim McCurry, and I'm with VDC Recruiting Group.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:35] Speaker_01:** But it's for Ryan McBrien.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:48] Speaker_01:** Got it.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** Okay, so I'm just going to log in under Ryan here.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** Yeah, do you know Ryan's username for PCR?

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** Should be R.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** McBride.

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** Let me check the email connection.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** Testing.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** Okay, yeah, it doesn't look like the email is connected to Office, so we'll have to reconnect that.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** If you – let's see.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** So are you currently signed in as R.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** McBride?

**[1:47] Speaker_01:** Uh-huh, correct.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Go to System in the main menu at the top center.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** Mm-hmm.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** and then go to email setup on the left okay and email alias on the right you know this list and then in the bottom I may be in the wrong spot hold on okay go back cuz I'm already click on email oh oh here so if you just want to go to your main PCR screen and then up in the main menu you'll see system at the top center.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** And then your it looks like Office 365 is your provider so you'll just want to click on sign in with Microsoft and connect to Microsoft that way.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** Okay, I think maybe it's something in, a window popped up and then it disappeared.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** Okay.
