**[0:14] Speaker_01:** This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** Okay, so if you're in the vault area, what you first have to do is turn off auto-pay.

**[0:24] Speaker_01:** Then you can delete the stored card, but you would have to re-add it.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** It doesn't let you just kind of swap out any information on it, even if I try to do it, because it's like all the numbers and everything, they're masked for security.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** So if you first turn off auto pay, then in the vault area, then you can delete that card, but you'll have to re-add it and then turn it on for auto pay again.
