## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_02:** This is Kathy.

**[0:02] Speaker_02:** Hey, what's up?

**[0:04] Speaker_02:** Hey, how's it going?

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Trying to get all these steps and that screwed up, and I'm realizing something's not screwing up.

**[0:15] Speaker_02:** Yeah, so that's the thing.

**[0:16] Speaker_02:** So I want to make sure that we don't get ourselves in the same boat.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[0:20] Speaker_02:** And so I'd much rather show you how to do it right than...

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** Yeah, because I'm afraid, like, if I uncheck that box, Is it going to charge their card now?

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** Because I have another one here that I'm looking at, Integra Partners.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:37] Speaker_02:** No, if you leave the box checked, if you leave it checked, then it's going to charge it.

**[0:41] Speaker_02:** So you have to uncheck the box because you don't want it to charge anything.

**[0:47] Speaker_02:** You want it to apply the credit.

**[0:50] Speaker_02:** So you can do it from within the invoice, or you can do it through receive payment.

**[0:56] Speaker_02:** But you want to make sure it's a zero payment.

**[1:00] Speaker_02:** And it's got the credit amount checked at the bottom.

**[1:04] Speaker_02:** And then it only has that amount in the invoice amount.

**[1:09] Speaker_02:** So if it has the full amount for the invoice, you want to override it.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:15] Speaker_00:** So uncheck process credit card, right?

**[1:18] Speaker_02:** Yes.

**[1:19] Speaker_02:** Yes.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** I was just wanting to make sure that that's not going to lead to the other issues.

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** Like remember how like some people like their card wasn't?

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** Okay, so we're not doing...

**[1:31] Speaker_02:** Yeah, you're just in this one.

**[1:33] Speaker_02:** You're not in the recurring, right?

**[1:35] Speaker_02:** You're in this one invoice that you want accredited.

**[1:39] Speaker_02:** So you're in an invoice that you dated $725, and so you're going to apply that credit.

**[1:46] Speaker_02:** How much is the credit?

**[1:47] Speaker_02:** $300, is that it?

**[1:48] Speaker_00:** $300, yeah.

**[1:49] Speaker_02:** Okay, so you'll say $300 on the invoice, and it'll have $300 in the credit, and it'll say depositing zero.

**[2:01] Speaker_02:** Right?

**[2:02] Speaker_02:** At the top, on the top right.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** Oh, amount received.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** I took everything out as far as the top.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** I unchecked the amount.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** I put amount received zero.

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** I checked the invoice, checked the credit memo.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** So it says amount to apply 300, amount to credit 975.

**[2:25] Speaker_02:** No, no, no, no, no.

**[2:26] Speaker_02:** So, yeah, you want it to say 300 on the invoice line.

**[2:30] Speaker_02:** So it should say invoice is $1,275 and the payment is $300.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** I don't want to make – you know what?

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** Can I – do you have a moment?
