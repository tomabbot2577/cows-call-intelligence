## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Please hold while I try to connect you.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** Hello.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** Hi, this is Tyler at PC Recruiter.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** Hey, Tyler.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** Hi, Jesse here.

**[0:35] Speaker_00:** Thanks for calling back.

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** Not a problem, not a problem.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** So you had a few questions about the AI tools in the database?

**[0:43] Speaker_01:** Exactly.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** For the most part, you know, like how does it work and does it cost anything in terms of getting that database re-indexed or something like that?

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** No, so you would just need to, we could put in a ticket for you to have that candidate AI match enabled.

**[1:07] Speaker_01:** And the way it works is based on like the job description and position information.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** It'll search your database for records that would be a good fit, like based on their resume and information like that.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Once it's activated, would we still need to have a tutorial or something?

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** I guess my question is, where would it appear on PCR?

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** It would be in the position record, the edit name screen, in that options menu.

**[1:46] Speaker_01:** It'll be available.

**[1:48] Speaker_00:** Options.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** Give me a second here.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** Options.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** Okay, right now we don't have it, so obviously I'll need to add...

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** It'll probably get added when our request is granted?

**[2:07] Speaker_01:** Yes, yeah, because we have to confirm with the contract signer for the account after as long as he wants it enabled.

**[2:17] Speaker_00:** Oh, yep, understood.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** Okay, Tyler, I do have a question about that, because my login, I login using Patrick's login, and my email address isn't exactly, although it's also at provisionpeople.com.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** I also have a princetonsp.com email address if that would work better.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** Would this get flagged, or is this something that, you know, you guys can just go through and make sure that, you know, we're all good there?

**[2:51] Speaker_01:** What do you mean, like if it would get flagged?

**[2:56] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:57] Speaker_00:** For example, let me just log out of PCR and let me see.

**[3:01] Speaker_00:** So the login that I use is cd-admin.

**[3:06] Speaker_00:** And then default.

**[3:10] Speaker_00:** The login looks different now.

**[3:12] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:14] Speaker_00:** That's interesting.

**[3:15] Speaker_01:** Yeah, we did run an update where the login page got updated.

**[3:23] Speaker_00:** Yep.

**[3:24] Speaker_00:** Okay, let me...

**[3:25] Speaker_00:** I'm filling up the form right now.

**[3:28] Speaker_00:** Do I just end at provision people, or do I add the end style sheet equals default, end mode equals to part, or do I just copy-paste the whole thing and put it in here for the PCR login link?

**[3:42] Speaker_01:** Just copy-paste the whole thing.

**[3:44] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[3:45] Speaker_00:** cool.

**[3:45] Speaker_00:** All right, Tyler, I guess my question was, if I fill up that form from the email, I put in my name, my email address, the complete login link, would it make a difference if I put in my email address, jesse at provisionpeople.com, or should I put in Patrick's email address?

**[4:11] Speaker_01:** I would put in Patrick's, because what will happen when you fill out that form, creates a ticket in the system and then they'll follow up with whoever gets to sign that ticket we'll follow up with the response to patrick for him to respond to all right well tyler let me let me get with that first so there won't be any surprises then i'll go ahead and fill up uh and and send this request all right sounds good all right thank you very much for calling back tyler Yep, no problem.

**[4:33] Speaker_00:** You have a great day.

**[4:37] Speaker_01:** You too.
