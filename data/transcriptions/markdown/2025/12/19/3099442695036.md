**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello, you have reached the voicemail of Sharon Pickerel.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** I am currently in the office but not available to take your call.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** Please leave me a message and I will return your call as soon as possible.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Thank you and have a great day.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** Please leave a message after the tone.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** When you have finished, please hang up or press the pound key for more options.

**[0:22] Speaker_02:** Hello, Sharon.

**[0:24] Speaker_02:** It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter.

**[0:26] Speaker_02:** I wanted to give you a quick call, just circling back with you.

**[0:28] Speaker_02:** With following up, I just wanted to confirm the agreement as sent over.

**[0:34] Speaker_02:** I didn't look like any changes were made to it.

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** I just want to make sure there was nothing changed, added, updated in it from when you sent it back.

**[0:42] Speaker_02:** If not, I will go ahead and have it drawn up and sent over into the Pandadoc format so we can get that going, just with the new dates and the new numbers and everything like that.

**[0:52] Speaker_02:** Give me a quick call and let me know if there is anything different or not.

**[0:54] Speaker_02:** My direct is 440-856-0314.

**[0:59] Speaker_02:** That's 440-856-0314.

**[1:03] Speaker_02:** I'll pop you an email too.

**[1:04] Speaker_02:** And I'm sorry for my delay.

**[1:05] Speaker_02:** I was out a little bit earlier this month and I'm having a heck of a time getting caught back up.

**[1:09] Speaker_02:** So running quite behind, but I appreciate the patience and I will get back to you soon with a quick email.

**[1:16] Speaker_02:** And as long as everything's just as it was in the last signed agreement, I'll just update the dates and the amounts and user counts and everything and we can get that going.

**[1:22] Speaker_02:** Talk to you soon.

**[1:24] Speaker_02:** Bye-bye.
