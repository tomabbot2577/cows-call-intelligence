## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** Deb Oaks from Wallbridge.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** How are you today?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** How are you doing, Deb?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** Not too bad, but I'm a little confused.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** What's that?

**[0:14] Speaker_01:** So it could be that it was me, user error.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** I don't know.

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** I went to do a global change to add a keyword phrase to 68 candidates, But now this is down to 65 because I was manually changing and I'm like, wait a minute.

**[0:30] Speaker_01:** Maybe I did something wrong.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** That's why it's happened.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** So when I looked at it, when it said that I wanted to put a phrase, it said to put it in quotes.

**[0:38] Speaker_01:** Was this supposed to be a single quote or a double quote?

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Are you doing bulk add keywords or are you doing?

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:46] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:46] Speaker_01:** Yeah, the bulk add keyword.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** It should be double quotes.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** Only if you're doing a straight up.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** It should be double quotes.

**[0:52] Speaker_01:** So that's probably why when I'm looking at them, I'm seeing a single quote around them because I use the single quote.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** Only if you're doing a phrase.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** If you're just doing one word, you don't need to do it.

**[1:03] Speaker_00:** Only if it's a phrase.

**[1:04] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I was doing a phrase.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** So it should have been double quotes.

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** So you'll want to do that again.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** But this time, I'll make sure I put the single quotes there and tell it to remove those and then add back in using double quotes.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** I wonder if you'll be able to do that.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** though.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** Let me think about that.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** Let me go to one of my databases I don't use very often and try something.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** I don't know if that'll be ignored, to be honest.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** I'm having some difficulty hearing you.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** So let's say I want to add project manager to these people.

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** No, usually it says use a single quote.

**[1:50] Speaker_01:** So I use single quotes.

**[1:51] Speaker_01:** Now when I go and I look, I see the single quote and my phrase and then a single quote again on their record.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** I'm going, wait a minute.

**[1:57] Speaker_00:** Okay, bulk add keyword, two names, only this list.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** Add.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Okay, let me first try it the way you did it, but just a single quote.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** Let's see what happens.
