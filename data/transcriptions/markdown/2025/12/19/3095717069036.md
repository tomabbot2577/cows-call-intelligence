## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hi, Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** My name is Sonya Quinn.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** I am with Priority Search.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** I've sent a couple text messages, or not text messages, sorry, emails to Patsy Lombardo.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** She's no longer with us.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** What can I help you with?

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** Well, that explains a lot.

**[0:21] Speaker_01:** So we have a monthly, like we have a credit card on file that we use for our monthly payment.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:29] Speaker_01:** And the owner of the company lost his wallet, so we needed to replace the credit card information, and I had sent that email to Patty Patsy, and I never received a response.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** Oh, okay.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** And then we received a decline on the 10th, and I sent another email to her, not knowing she wasn't with you guys.

**[0:52] Speaker_01:** And so just this morning, I'm like, they still have not responded, and that's odd.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** So we're just trying to update credit card information.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** I can do that for you.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Okay, so the card, because we've got the new billing portal.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** Let's see.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** The card that we have ends in 8312.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** So we want to take that one off, right?

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** Okay, hold on one second.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** That's right.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** And are you going to update that with me now?

**[1:18] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I can do it for you.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** Or you could do it in our new billing portal, which has to be done by C-Pro.

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** No, it's okay.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** I'll help you do it.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** I just need to get it up.

**[1:25] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** All right, bear with me.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** let me turn the auto pay off for a moment.

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** You have to turn it off before you can delete the card.

**[1:34] Speaker_00:** I will delete this card then.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** What is the new card?

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** What is the name on the card?

**[1:49] Speaker_01:** It's going to be the same name.

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** William Crooks.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** William.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** And how do you spell his name?

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** C-R-O-O-K-S.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[2:01] Speaker_00:** And the card number?
