**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Hey, how's it going?

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Yo.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** So Eric called back in?

**[0:08] Speaker_02:** Yeah, he said it started working for him, but he's still confused about then why was this specific batch or whatever.

**[0:14] Speaker_02:** He sent me five of the resumes from the batch, so I was going to.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** Yeah, it could have just, you could just tell him, like, could have been, like, a security tag issue, like, because they had it where they started flagging some emails as coming from an external source.

**[0:44] Speaker_02:** Oh, okay.

**[0:45] Speaker_02:** External source would be considered a tag.

**[0:49] Speaker_02:** Okay, interesting.

**[0:50] Speaker_02:** All right.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** Yeah, like when you look at it in your inbox, it says, like, external.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** okay but it could also just be um there was just one bad resume in the bunch that can cause issues with the inhaler too gotcha and he said they were from Monster Dispatch and that he said there was some kind of delay on the email, like the email was delayed from Monster.

**[1:28] Speaker_02:** I don't know how he knows, like, how do you know an email was delayed in send there?

**[1:34] Speaker_02:** You know, I was just confused most of the time he was talking about like, okay, I'll take notes on what you're saying.

**[1:40] Speaker_02:** But yeah, so I'll just make the ticket.

**[1:43] Speaker_02:** And so we'll have his screenshots and everything in that.

**[1:46] Speaker_02:** And I'll just say that it seems like if there was one resume in the bunch that was bad, it would maybe make the whole batch.

**[1:56] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[1:57] Speaker_01:** Well, yeah, if it errors out and causes an issue.

**[2:02] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** Which, like, we can test the five.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:10] Speaker_02:** Yeah, that'll be good.

**[2:12] Speaker_02:** I'll test those.

**[2:13] Speaker_01:** Even if you want to hop on a screen share tomorrow and test them.

**[2:18] Speaker_02:** Yeah, okay.

**[2:19] Speaker_02:** We'll see.

**[2:21] Speaker_02:** And then...

**[2:23] Speaker_02:** put it, and I'll make sure to use, he was using the email folder function in ResumeHaler, not just the computer folder.

**[2:31] Speaker_02:** So yeah, I'll try that out.

**[2:32] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I would test it in both, just to be safe.

**[2:35] Speaker_02:** Okay, good idea.

**[2:36] Speaker_01:** Yeah, we can, like I said, we can tag team it.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** I know what to look for with those.

**[2:41] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** Okay, cool.

**[2:44] Speaker_02:** Yeah, maybe when we're both free tomorrow sometime, we'll tackle that.

**[2:47] Speaker_02:** Awesome.

**[2:48] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'm pretty free most of the day.

**[2:50] Speaker_01:** it looks like you only have the 10 o'clock yeah good yeah I'm pretty free the whole day too good I might have you help me with some other stuff too sure I created a bunch of tickets for like some PCRM bug fixes like small stuff but it was 17 tickets and it's just been a pain in the ass trying to get them all documented to send out the bug testing okay yeah you can definitely send a few of those my way I'll have time tomorrow to knock that out for sure we can take a look at them tomorrow I'll send that and go over them yeah just send an invite for whenever yeah we'll do right before we go to lunch cool that'll be good there.

**[3:53] Speaker_01:** We'll just send you an invite.

**[3:54] Speaker_01:** We'll just hop on the screen and share when it happens.

**[3:57] Speaker_01:** Nice.

**[3:58] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[4:00] Speaker_01:** Yeah, that's my guess is that there's probably one shitty resume in there.

**[4:06] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[4:07] Speaker_01:** It's causing a bunch of issues.

**[4:10] Speaker_02:** All right.

**[4:11] Speaker_02:** Yeah, I'll wait to respond until we take a look at it.
