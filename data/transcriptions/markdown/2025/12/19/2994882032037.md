**[2:37] Speaker_03:** So what we want to do today is he's going to have a few questions for you just about some of the specifics you want to cover in the training, how you're going to use the system, a few integrations you want to do.

**[2:48] Speaker_03:** You being dimensional search, we know that you're going to be looking for RingCentral setup, the higher easy setup so some of the stuff we kind of know and then at the conclusion of today's call he's going to get a couple of hours on the schedule with you before your training class on the 7th as quickly as we can match schedules for the to you and I would be one if you needed to add users down the line or drop users or anything like that that comes right to me or if there's anything you need that you don't know who to ask to get that to me and then I can kind of help you out or get you to someone who can.

**[3:22] Speaker_03:** So without further ado, I'm going to turn everything over to Jason to just run through the questions and then get the first session or two on the calendar for you.

**[3:40] Speaker_00:** And the questions I have today are just going to kind of help shape what our training sessions are going to look like.

**[3:44] Speaker_00:** So the first question I have is going to be, what type of recruiting are you planning on doing?
