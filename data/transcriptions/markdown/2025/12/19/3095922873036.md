## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** This is Tyler.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** How can I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Hey, I was calling because we had an employee who was let go a few weeks ago and noticed in the user login log that somehow he's been logging in, even though his password's been changed.

**[0:23] Speaker_00:** And I was wondering if anyone can help us figure out how this is possible as well as if it's even possible to figure out what he's doing.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Yeah, so you said you were checking the user logins that that user was logging in?

**[0:41] Speaker_00:** Yeah, under the user login screen, it shows that he's been logging in.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** You still there?

**[0:53] Speaker_02:** yeah okay it's kind of breaking up a little bit okay i'm not sure if i lost you or not but i can't hear you at all you're still there i am i can hear you now okay perfect okay here we go Did you catch everything I said or did I cut out at any point?

**[1:25] Speaker_01:** Yeah, so you had someone log in.

**[1:27] Speaker_01:** It was on the user login screen that they were logging in still.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** What database were they logging into?

**[1:35] Speaker_00:** The Jacob search group.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** Because you can always disable that username as well.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** That's not really as big of a concern at this point.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:48] Speaker_00:** The password has been changed.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** I'm more concerned about how he's been able to log in.

**[1:57] Speaker_02:** And who is the user?

**[1:59] Speaker_02:** It's Kenny.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** You'll see two logins this morning.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** That's from me checking to see that the new password that I changed it to, just to make sure that I actually did in fact change the password.

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** So the new password works, which I checked this morning.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** The old password does not work.

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** So I'm kind of at a loss.

**[2:24] Speaker_00:** I don't know how else he'd get access to that new password.

**[2:28] Speaker_01:** Yeah, that I am not sure.

**[2:32] Speaker_00:** Because we don't even have access to those passwords.

**[2:35] Speaker_00:** That's what I was thinking.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** I was like, well, if he called in, I don't think they would read him his password.

**[2:41] Speaker_00:** They'd probably send them a link or probably refer them to me to go in.

**[2:47] Speaker_01:** So even with like changing passwords, we have to send a password reset form to the contract signer for the account.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** And unless we have a physical signature, we can't like we have to have a physical signature from a contract signer.

**[3:05] Speaker_00:** Mm-hmm.

**[3:06] Speaker_00:** So what about the phone app?

**[3:11] Speaker_00:** Is it possible that maybe he had that installed and it – does it stay logged in all the time or does it require logging in like it does on the web app or the – yeah, like the web app?

**[3:24] Speaker_01:** So it would stay signed in, but as soon as the password is changed, it would log you out.

**[3:31] Speaker_00:** okay well he is not tech savvy so I highly doubt he found a way to hack his way in I'm I don't know how this is I don't know if you have any suggestions on what we do from here but yeah because it doesn't look like because in those logging options it would tell you if something was exported as well right because which uh when was he let go he was let go on september 5th so he's he's been logging in the 8th the 11th the 12th the 15th 16th 17th 18th he's logged in you know almost 10 times probably i'm trying to see now did he work remote as well occasionally he would work from home yeah that's the that's the ip address um and i went and looked back at the the old logs before he was terminated and everything and it's the same IP address.

**[4:53] Speaker_00:** So that's why I was like, okay, well, it's definitely coming from his computer.

**[4:56] Speaker_01:** Excuse me.

**[4:59] Speaker_00:** So, but no, he worked in the office full time, but he would, you know, he would access PCR from home, like on a weekend or at night if he needed to.

**[5:20] Speaker_02:** I have no idea how it would be a successful login.

**[5:30] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[5:34] Speaker_02:** Because he was only in the one database, correct?

**[5:36] Speaker_02:** He didn't log into any others?

**[5:43] Speaker_00:** Well, no, he's not supposed to log into the other ones.

**[5:50] Speaker_00:** It doesn't look like he...

**[5:51] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'm looking at the database ID part now.

**[5:55] Speaker_00:** Yeah, it doesn't look like he logged into any of those anyways.

**[6:01] Speaker_00:** But we had a test database just recently copied over.
