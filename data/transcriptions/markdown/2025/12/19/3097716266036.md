## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Hey, good morning.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Good afternoon.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** This is Scott Shapiro.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** How are you doing?

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I've got a question.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** So I'm calling from MRI Charlotte.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** I'm looking to – we're in the name activity screen.

**[0:21] Speaker_01:** If you could log in.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** I'm just looking to add some couple of things to the activity screen, if you can help us with.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** So you're not the name layout, but the activity screen?

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** So, yeah.

**[0:38] Speaker_01:** So can you log into the admin account for us?

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Is it when you're writing an activity, or is it like an activity search?

**[0:48] Speaker_01:** So, right, so at the bottom of the, you know, when you're, if you go to MyPCR, and on the bottom left, it has name activities, and you click on name activities, and then the toolbar across the top has name, date, company, want to see, want to be able to add location as well.

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** Oh, that screen is not customizable.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** Oh, it's not?

**[1:21] Speaker_00:** That one is not.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** Yeah, just like your name search results name roll-up layout, but the name activity search is not customizable.

**[1:35] Speaker_01:** So if there's a new name activity, we're not always able to see what it's showing, which is the name, the date of time of the activity, and the company.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Correct.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** You can click on the name to go into the person's details to see any field data.

**[1:57] Speaker_00:** But this is just related to the activity.

**[2:01] Speaker_01:** Got it.

**[2:02] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** Thank you.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** You're welcome.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** Have a great week.

**[2:07] Speaker_01:** Bye.
