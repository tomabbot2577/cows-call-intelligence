## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_02:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:03] Speaker_02:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** This is Chuck Draper.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** I have management recruiters of Quakertown or CDP Solutions.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** How are you doing?

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** I'm good.

**[0:12] Speaker_02:** How are you?

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[0:14] Speaker_01:** I had a new computer a little while back at the beginning of the year, and I've got PC Recruiter set up on it.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** I cannot, for some reason, download, like when I'm in a profile for, like, a candidate, I'm unable to open up attachments.

**[0:32] Speaker_01:** Oh, attachments.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** Yeah, so I'm assuming I'm misdownloading something.

**[0:37] Speaker_02:** Yeah, probably Java Launcher.

**[0:38] Speaker_02:** And I assume you're on Windows computer?

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** I am, correct.

**[0:42] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:42] Speaker_02:** If you go to your Windows search area, can you type, like, the word app and see if you have apps and features?

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** A-P-P, like app?

**[0:52] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:53] Speaker_02:** We'll try it that way.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** And hit enter?

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** Yes.

**[0:56] Speaker_02:** Okay, let's see here.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** Do you see app and features?

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** Do I see app and feature?

**[1:04] Speaker_02:** Mm-hmm.

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** I see an app there, but it brings me to a home.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** I mean, if I...

**[1:13] Speaker_01:** I don't...

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** Yeah, different windows.

**[1:15] Speaker_02:** It's worded differently.

**[1:17] Speaker_02:** Let's do this.

**[1:18] Speaker_02:** Let's do a screen share.

**[1:19] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:25] Speaker_01:** Where...

**[1:25] Speaker_01:** Where do I go?

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** What site?

**[1:27] Speaker_02:** Let's see.

**[1:36] Speaker_02:** Let me do that this way.

**[1:41] Speaker_02:** And is it cdraper at mri-cdpsolutions.com?

**[1:47] Speaker_02:** Is that your email?

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** Yeah, it is.

**[1:49] Speaker_01:** But I use a different email address than that now.

**[1:52] Speaker_02:** Oh, okay.

**[1:52] Speaker_01:** I think that will still come through to me.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** I think that's still a pre-existing domain or email address.

**[1:59] Speaker_02:** What's your preferred email?

**[2:00] Speaker_02:** Because I'm just going to send you an email.
