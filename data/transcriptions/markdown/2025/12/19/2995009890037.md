## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Brian Henson.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** Good morning, Brian.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** Jim, how are you?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I am well.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I got your voicemail.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** I want to give you a holler back.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** Yeah, man.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** How's life?

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** You're, uh, I think you're going to die working for PC Recruiter, aren't you?

**[0:17] Speaker_00:** I don't spend a long, long time.

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** Twice a year.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** How are things going?

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** Doing all right.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** Doing all right.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** How about you?

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** Yeah, good.

**[0:30] Speaker_01:** Busy.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** It's picking up.

**[0:32] Speaker_01:** So it's a rough couple years, 23 and 24, but, you know, starting to pick up in tech.

**[0:35] Speaker_01:** So this is where I'm focused.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** And so that's good news.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** But anyway, I was curious how things are going with PCR, and I get hit up every other day on other ATSs and just haven't seen a lot of news and stuff about PCR lately and was just curious how things are going.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** Going pretty good.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** We're moving along.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** We have updated the 9 interface to match a little bit more of our new product, PCRM, which I don't know if you've heard of.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** The PCRM is a CRM product is essentially what it is, and it runs on the same database as PC Recruiter.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** So it's going to share the same database, but it's a totally new and different interface that includes a sales pipeline, better sequencing, a lot different of a look and feel there.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** but it's going to include almost everything that 9 has.

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** So it's going to have the pipeline, job tracking, job posting, kind of everything you know and love about the existing PC Recruiter, but with some added CRM functionality.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** So it gives some additional functions there.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** So how do I not know about that?

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** Do you guys not communicate to your existing customer base?

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** Well, it only has very recently been released, if you will, because it was originally started as an update to our existing platform and then added some different CRM functionalities.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** And early this month, we decided to roll it out as a separate product here.

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** But we're still working some kinks out of some of the areas.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** Like the one thing that a lot of our existing customers haven't heard about it is because the keyword Boolean searching is not in there yet.

**[2:24] Speaker_00:** So that's still having to be added.

**[2:27] Speaker_00:** So I saw it, yes, two days ago.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** I saw it, and they're going to be putting it in next week, I believe.

**[2:33] Speaker_00:** So that's why we haven't really shouted it from the rooftops.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** because there's Boolean searching is lacking in there right now.

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[2:40] Speaker_00:** But if you're doing like sales tracking, something like that, that you need a sales pipeline, it's going to be a real helpful piece.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** Or if you just want to take a look at the interface and kind of see what it looks like, maybe you'll find you like it a little better.

**[2:54] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** I mean, does it do anything different other than when you say sales pipeline, what do you mean?
