## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Hey, what's up, Nick?

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** Hey.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** So James wants me to have you run or have you as like a point person for escalations while I'm gone.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** Because there's not really anyone else and Bill won't end up doing them.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** so I'll talk about it at the support meeting tomorrow but basically if they have issues they can just take it to you and then if it's like fuck you guys this is how we do it yeah I mean if so if it's not urgent and you don't know what to do with it they can wait until I get back then let me know if it is urgent, there's a couple different options.

**[1:00] Speaker_00:** You can send me a message on Discord if you want to.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** I'm going to go through my emails once a day or once every other day so I can eventually respond to you.

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** But I'm not really going to do any real work.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** So if you know what to do with it you need to answer.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** You can either take it to James or Bill.

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** It kind of depends on what it is.

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** So if you don't know what to do, let me know and then I'll tell you.

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** Like, hey, I know what to do here.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** Who do I need to talk to to make sure I come to my bases?

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** Yeah, and if it's not super important, then whatever.

**[1:48] Speaker_00:** But you'll be good to, they can you get good suggestions for stuff with troubleshooting and things like that.

**[1:57] Speaker_00:** So that'll make it easier.

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** Yeah, for what?

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** A week?

**[2:01] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so I'll be gone.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** I'm working tomorrow morning.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** Probably done at noon.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** And then I'm out Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.

**[2:10] Speaker_00:** I'll be back on Thursday.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** So it's not that long workday-wise.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** It's only really four of them.

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** just in case.

**[2:19] Speaker_00:** If there's anything crazy that happens.

**[2:23] Speaker_00:** Oh, also tomorrow.

**[2:28] Speaker_00:** I'll bring it up tomorrow in the meeting.

**[2:31] Speaker_01:** So, yeah.

**[2:33] Speaker_01:** Well, that'll work out perfect because I have Garrett helping me with some stuff tomorrow.

**[2:38] Speaker_01:** And I should be pretty much freed up after that.

**[2:42] Speaker_01:** Because I have all those tickets created for all the bug tickets.

**[2:46] Speaker_01:** it's just a pain in the ass between phone calls trying to like start making bug tickets so I told Garrett I got like three or four of them done today I was like yeah Garrett I might need your help just documenting these but like the title is clear as it gets like I have the template in there it's just a matter of filling it out so he's we're going to divvy the rest of them up so that way I can send all those up tomorrow not.

**[3:17] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** Yeah, no, no, that's good.

**[3:19] Speaker_00:** And, like, none of them are super urgent anyway, so they've been issues for forever, but I don't think it's...

**[3:26] Speaker_00:** Yeah, they're just...

**[3:28] Speaker_00:** I would like them fixed eventually.

**[3:32] Speaker_01:** Yeah, well, it was fucking...

**[3:36] Speaker_01:** I'm, like, trying to tell Mac I can't do something in...

**[3:40] Speaker_01:** like the...

**[3:42] Speaker_01:** like the Lucene upgrades and all that, and he's like, you sure?

**[3:47] Speaker_01:** Pretty sure I've showed you how to do this.

**[3:48] Speaker_01:** But I was like, Mac, I know what I can do.

**[3:51] Speaker_00:** It's only how I don't have access.

**[3:53] Speaker_00:** I know how to type refresh or upgrade in a file.

**[3:57] Speaker_01:** I know how to press the up to Lucene button.
