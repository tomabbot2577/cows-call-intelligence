**[0:12] Speaker_02:** Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:15] Speaker_02:** We had an email from you.

**[0:18] Speaker_02:** There seemed to be some confusion about the AI Match tool and turning it on.

**[0:24] Speaker_02:** So we did have our tech team turn that on and they emailed you with information about how to use it and kind of a confirmation that it's been turned on for your account.

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** So yeah, I just wanted to reinforce that email that they sent to you and that's why we closed out the ticket.

**[0:43] Speaker_02:** But let us know if you have any questions.

**[0:47] Speaker_02:** Feel free to look at the Learning Center article that the tech team member sent in that previous email it'll go over how to use the tool.

**[0:57] Speaker_02:** Otherwise, I guess give us a ring or email us back if you have more questions.
