**[0:01] Speaker_04:** Hello, this is Elizabeth.

**[0:02] Speaker_04:** Can I help you?

**[0:04] Speaker_02:** Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:06] Speaker_02:** I received your voicemail.

**[0:07] Speaker_02:** You had some questions around PCR and Outlook.

**[0:12] Speaker_04:** Yeah, my question...

**[0:14] Speaker_04:** I was about to do something, but I can wait.

**[0:17] Speaker_04:** It's going to just clock me out.

**[0:19] Speaker_04:** But what was my question?

**[0:21] Speaker_04:** My old...

**[0:22] Speaker_04:** I have both the new Outlook and the old Outlook, meaning not the new version.

**[0:27] Speaker_04:** So my question was, PC Recruiter, as of this week, I can't even open it up on my old Outlook, let alone the new one.

**[0:39] Speaker_04:** But I think that you or someone else told me that the new one, PC Recruiter is not, I can't use it on the platform.

**[0:47] Speaker_02:** Right, yeah.

**[0:48] Speaker_02:** So we're only...

**[0:49] Speaker_04:** Just to do my thing.

**[0:50] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:51] Speaker_02:** Yes, the portal's only compatible with Outlook Classic, but we can get that back appearing for you there.

**[1:00] Speaker_02:** It might be that it had a slow start time once, and Outlook will kind of disable the add-in, and I can show you where to check that.

**[1:11] Speaker_02:** Let's see.

**[1:13] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** So do you have Outlook Classic open right now?

**[1:17] Speaker_02:** I do.

**[1:18] Speaker_04:** Yes, I do.

**[1:19] Speaker_02:** Perfect.

**[1:20] Speaker_02:** So go to File in the main menu up at the top.

**[1:24] Speaker_04:** Okay.

**[1:24] Speaker_02:** And in yellow, do you have anything highlighted that says slow and disabled com add-ins?

**[1:31] Speaker_02:** Hold on.

**[1:32] Speaker_04:** Say that again because you cut out.

**[1:33] Speaker_04:** What did you just say?

**[1:34] Speaker_04:** I'm sorry.

**[1:35] Speaker_02:** Oh, sorry.

**[1:35] Speaker_02:** It might be highlighted in yellow there on the screen.

**[1:39] Speaker_02:** It'll say slow and disabled com add-ins.

**[1:42] Speaker_02:** Is that listed anywhere?

**[1:43] Speaker_04:** It just says open, export, save as, save as Adobe, and then print.

**[1:50] Speaker_04:** And then next to it, it'll say, oh, they're ad account, you mean?

**[1:54] Speaker_02:** So it would be under Add Account, there should be things like Account Settings and Mailbox Settings.

**[2:00] Speaker_04:** Oh, yeah, it has Account Settings.

**[2:03] Speaker_02:** Below that, does it list anywhere slow and disabled COM add-ins?

**[2:08] Speaker_04:** It just says Account Setting, Account Name, and Sync Settings, Server Settings, Change Profile, Manage Profile.

**[2:16] Speaker_02:** Okay, so you clicked on the Account Settings button.

**[2:19] Speaker_02:** So instead of clicking on that, just look a little bit lower.

**[2:23] Speaker_02:** do you have what are the things listed below account settings do you have like mailbox settings below that rules and alerts below that and manage rules and alerts and tools and account settings account settings tools and manage rules and alerts okay nothing below so on if this was the issue that I thought it was right below manage rules and alerts would be an additional one that says manage com add-ins so that's not showing for you okay all right so let's jump on a screen share then and I'll investigate a little bit further here so if you just want to open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings ring central com oh I might have rings on already on my desktop let's see okay let me just call RingCentral.
