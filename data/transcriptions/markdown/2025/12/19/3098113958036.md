## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** I'm a current user of PCR, and I'm having issues with PCR capture.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** The button's there, but it doesn't do anything when I click it.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** It kind of acts like it knows I'm clicking it, but nothing goes any further to actually entail the information.

**[0:26] Speaker_01:** in.

**[0:27] Speaker_01:** Got it.

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** So at the top right of your screen, click on the little PCR capture logo to open up the capture menu.

**[0:35] Speaker_00:** At the bottom, there's a few toggles.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** One of them says basic mode.

**[0:41] Speaker_00:** Is that turned off and to the left?

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** It's on and to the right.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** If you turn it off and to the left, it'll stop doing that issue.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** Basically, when basic mode is on, it captures the person without letting you see any of the information being captured.

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** Gosh, I didn't realize I had to change that maybe.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so we recommend always keeping that one off.

**[1:04] Speaker_01:** Okay, okay.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** Let me see if it reloads.

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** Do I need to log out and log back in?

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** No, you should be fine.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** I would just refresh the LinkedIn profile that you have pulled up, if it's still pulled up, and try again.

**[1:21] Speaker_01:** Let's do update.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** Yeah, it's acting like it's thinking now.

**[1:29] Speaker_01:** Oh, my gosh, I feel so silly.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** I don't know how I've turned that off.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** Oh, no worries.

**[1:37] Speaker_01:** Okay, that's as simple as it gets for you all day.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Yeah, no problem.

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** Yeah, anything else you've been noticing off with the capture tool or any problems in PCR?

**[1:46] Speaker_01:** No, not really.

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** Well, actually, now that I have you, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know if it's based on our setup, but when I go to activities, it defaults to only seeing SMS instead of all.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** Yeah, you can adjust that for your username.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** It's kind of your activity default filters.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** If you, let's see, pull up activities on any name record.

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:19] Speaker_00:** And then you – oh, sorry.

**[2:23] Speaker_00:** I think my internet connection is going a little bit – can you still hear me all right?

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** Yep, I sure can.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** Oh, good.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:30] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, if you have activities pulled up, in the action menu at the top right, there's something called default filters.

**[2:37] Speaker_00:** It's a gear icon.

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** It might not be pinned, though, so you'll probably have to click the three horizontal lines.

**[2:44] Speaker_01:** I'm in the gear configure activity filters, yeah.

**[2:48] Speaker_00:** Awesome, yeah.
