**[0:51] Speaker_00:** No, she's actually really good about that.

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** She hardly ever brings laundry home.

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** She manages to get her zone done.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** um it's my son that will come home with tons and tons of laundry well my my mom and and my wife said to the kids there's the washing machine go for it yeah yeah he doesn't and he's so bad like he's so funny because like the first time he left and he did his own laundry like you know first year i used to yell him at all the time like about everything being inside out especially socks you and just kind of rip them off.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** So finally, first time he did his own laundry at school, he calls me and goes, I am so sorry.

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** And I'm like, what happened?

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** He goes, well, I did my own laundry and all of my socks were inside out.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** He goes, it's a total pain.

**[1:38] Speaker_00:** I'm like, I told you.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** I'm like, you make everything like so much harder just because you won't turn your socks the right way.

**[1:45] Speaker_01:** And at that moment in their life, it wasn't important.

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** They didn't understand the value.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Well, then he came home like, you know, one of the times last year.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** I think it was like after the school year.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** And he had, of course, all of his laundry needed to be done because he didn't do it.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** And, yeah, it was like, dude, you didn't listen.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** You didn't learn.

**[2:06] Speaker_01:** Did you do the laundry, mother?

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Yes, I did.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** Stop that.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** Stop it.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** Stop it.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** I know.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** I'm such an enabler.

**[2:33] Speaker_00:** No, it's my son's third, my daughter's second.

**[2:35] Speaker_00:** But here's the big difference, too.

**[2:38] Speaker_00:** At OU, you have to pay for laundry.

**[2:40] Speaker_00:** It's like $2 to wash, $1 to dry.

**[2:43] Speaker_00:** So he doesn't like saving his little money, you know, spending the little money he has at school on laundry.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** where at Ohio State at least the laundry is free so my daughter just kind of she just does it whenever she needs to I wish they didn't charge for laundry but they do at OU it's part of real life you know it's part of real life yeah I remember going for orientation at Ohio State and they said it's about you know and the laundry machines are free and I'm like oh That's nice.
