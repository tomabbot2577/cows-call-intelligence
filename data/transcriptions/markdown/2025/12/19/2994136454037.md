## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Namesquence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** May I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Hi.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** This is Kay Rogan.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** I'm calling from the Rogan Group.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** We're PC recruiter users.

**[0:14] Speaker_00:** And I have a quick question.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** I don't know if anyone else, like your other clients, are having the same issue, but everyone in my office seems to be having issues with PCR being really slow.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** like every everything like when you're just like looking anything up or trying to like just now I just like saved something and it's just the bottom is just went blank and now it just came on so I would say it's like 30 to 40 seconds before like anything happens like the icons don't come up for a little it's like a delay I guess yeah is this the Rogan group or the TRG legal database?

**[0:56] Speaker_00:** I think he's having problems too.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** I think it's both the TRG database and the Rogan Group database.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:05] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** I'm going to log into the Rogan Group on my end and see if it's slow to load here.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** If it's slow to load on my end, that would mean that it's a server issue on our side.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:17] Speaker_00:** Let's see.

**[1:18] Speaker_00:** And that's actually going pretty fast here.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** So it's more of a local issue.

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** Are you all sharing the same internet connection?

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** No, actually the person who uses the TRG legal the most is in a different location.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** So I think he was having issues too.

**[1:45] Speaker_01:** Okay, I'm going to log in under TRG Legal here, test that as well.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** There we go.

**[1:58] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'm performing searches, jump in between records.

**[2:02] Speaker_01:** It's all happening quickly on that.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** So you think it would be more an Internet issue for us?

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I would recommend either restarting the router, your Internet router, or if you do have like a virus protection software that has web protection.

**[2:26] Speaker_00:** if there's any way to you know turn that off the web protection part that usually speeds up PCR kind of as a session based website I wonder if I okay so I should probably check with our technology company because it just started this like yes today's only Tuesday or today's Wednesday yeah I think it just started yesterday that it was happening so maybe they made some changes to the virus protection?

**[2:59] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:59] Speaker_00:** Yes.

**[3:00] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:00] Speaker_01:** If there's a setting in there for, yeah, web protection, if you could toggle that off anyway in your virus scanning software, that usually speeds things up.

**[3:12] Speaker_01:** Otherwise, yeah, try maybe restarting the router.

**[3:15] Speaker_01:** It could help as well.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:19] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[3:20] Speaker_00:** So do you think it's us?

**[3:21] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:21] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[3:26] Speaker_01:** Let me see what I can come up with.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** I appreciate that.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** Thank you.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** No problem.

**[3:29] Speaker_00:** Reach out if you need anything else.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** We will.

**[3:31] Speaker_00:** Thanks.
