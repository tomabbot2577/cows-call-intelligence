**[0:58] Speaker_02:** We have some people at lunch as well.

**[1:00] Speaker_02:** Anyway, you can't print directly if you went to company and then hit names, but if you took those names and put them into a roll-up list, then you'd be able to select and print or even export to Excel depending on your securities.

**[1:16] Speaker_02:** You had also mentioned that you're trying to compare it with a different list.

**[1:20] Speaker_02:** So sometimes it might be helpful if you want to see who's on one list.

**[1:24] Speaker_02:** Well, they can't be.

**[1:24] Speaker_02:** It'd be too different.

**[1:26] Speaker_02:** If you wanted to see like people that are in that list, but maybe compared to another, there might be some search options with that.
