## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling me.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** Hello.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** Hey, Garrett, Alyssa at HC Pursuit.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[0:17] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** I am all right.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** Actually, I'm working from home, kind of not really working, recovering from surgery I had on Monday.

**[0:25] Speaker_01:** but I figured while I'm away from my desk, I can ask questions.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** It popped up on Facebook about the AI match.

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** And so we did the re-indexing of the database so we could do some other AI thingy.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** Steve said he didn't see the AI match.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** I don't know if he went to the right spot.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** I guess my question is, do we have it?

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** Is there something else we need to do?

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** What's the story on that?

**[1:03] Speaker_00:** Yeah, the procedure would be having your PCR contract signer, Steve, reach out and say that they want the AI match turned on as part of your AI free trial.

**[1:14] Speaker_00:** And then we will have to reindex your database again, but you shouldn't notice any changes or differences as we're doing that.

**[1:21] Speaker_00:** so you can use PCR normally, and then we will install the tool, the AI candidate match.

**[1:28] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** Turn on candidate match.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** Terrific.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** Let me let him know that he needs to reach out to you all to effect that, and we'll go from there.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** Awesome.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah, that sounds good.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** And if any other questions come up around that, just let us know.

**[1:49] Speaker_01:** not at this moment, but I will let him know that he needs to, does he need to email you guys or what does he need to do?

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** You could just send a email to support at main sequence.net.

**[2:05] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** Perfect.

**[2:09] Speaker_01:** I will, I'll let him know to do that forthwith.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** Thank you so much.

**[2:13] Speaker_01:** Awesome.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** Thank you so much.

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** Have a great rest of your day.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** Thanks.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** You too.
