**[0:00] Speaker_02:** Hello?

**[0:01] Speaker_02:** Hi.

**[0:02] Speaker_02:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** This is your call.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Someone called me like two minutes before that.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** I was just trying to finish up on that one.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Just you, a meeting invite.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:17] Speaker_02:** And I should do this on my new computer.

**[0:20] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:22] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:23] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** Yeah, because you want this working on your new one.

**[0:26] Speaker_02:** Right.

**[0:27] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** Let's see.

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** I don't know if it's going to work, but we're going to try it.

**[0:32] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** That's the only thing I can do.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** What I'm thinking is if you're self-hosted, you kind of purchase the software.

**[0:40] Speaker_00:** It doesn't really include updates.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** So every once in a while, you have to pay an upgrade fee.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** The last one I saw for your company is from 2022.

**[0:48] Speaker_00:** So I'm wondering if your version of PC Recruiter itself is not current enough to be compatible with the newer one, at least for the login.

**[0:58] Speaker_00:** So what I want to do...

**[1:01] Speaker_02:** That actually makes sense because it looks like from my old emails that 2022 was when I last had to set this up again.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so what I'm thinking is if we had 5.1.3 before, we just had to track that version down.

**[1:15] Speaker_00:** If we install it with this, then maybe, you know, we get it to work.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** If not, then maybe we, I mean, hopefully we get that to work.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** And if that works, we can even try installing 530 if you're already connected.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** Hold on.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:33] Speaker_02:** Thanks.

**[1:34] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:34] Speaker_00:** I'm going to mute in the meeting because we don't need that.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:37] Speaker_00:** So here's what I'm going to have you do.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** I'm going to have you go to the share screen option.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** Now, I am hoping this works.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Copy link.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** But make sure you go to entire screen.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** I did.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** Here's what I'm going to have you do.
