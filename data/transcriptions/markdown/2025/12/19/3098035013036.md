## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** My name is James.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Karen has been a client for, I don't know, like 11 years now.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** I just noticed when I go to PCR capture, if I'm on LinkedIn, actually, I've noticed this for a while now.

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** But when I go there and I go to candidate and you know how you can like put them into PCR from there.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** If they're already in my database, and sometimes even if not, it won't let me choose their current company on LinkedIn.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** It used to do that.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** Are you familiar with this?

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** Yeah, it could be just a setting at the top.

**[0:49] Speaker_01:** When you click on the extension at the top right of your browser, that's going to pop up all the links or sites that it supports.

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** At the very bottom right, is basic mode off?

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** Like, is it showing gray or blue?

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** Sorry.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** One second.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** So if I go to – I couldn't see what you were talking about.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** So I go to click to update on this guy.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** No, actually, clicking directly on the extension at the top right of your browser.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[1:21] Speaker_00:** I got you.

**[1:21] Speaker_00:** Hold on one second.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** Yeah, because it's probably a setting.

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** Yep.

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** Okay, capture.

**[1:27] Speaker_00:** Okay, and then it says basic mode is not on.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** Capture to default company is what it says right now.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** Okay, is that on?

**[1:35] Speaker_00:** That's on.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** Capture to default company is on.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** If you turn that off so it's gray, like usually you want all of those gray.

**[1:42] Speaker_01:** If you slide that so it's gray, what that will do is let you either create or pick a company.

**[1:49] Speaker_01:** Otherwise, it's trying to put everybody into your default company.

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** Okay, that's extremely helpful.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** Okay, that's all I need to do.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** So basic mode, dark mode, don't mess with those.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** Yeah, oh, definitely don't do basic mode.

**[2:01] Speaker_01:** If it was up to me, I'd take that one out completely.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** That's for the people that want things to just be super fast and with no review or it's just ads.

**[2:09] Speaker_01:** You never want to do that.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** I definitely don't want to do that.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** Yeah, and I'm sorry, how do you spell your last name?

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** C-A-I-R-N-S.

**[2:19] Speaker_00:** Gotcha, okay.

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** That's spelling wrong.

**[2:22] Speaker_01:** Okay, yeah, that was probably the setting.

**[2:25] Speaker_01:** So now you should, and you'll want to definitely watch when you have that capture to default company off.

**[2:31] Speaker_01:** If the company is already found in your database as an exact match, hover on that card and use the checkbox.
