## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** This is Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Hi, Robin.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** I am a current customer, and we use sequencing, and I'm having an issue with it.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** Is there somebody that could help me?

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** Yes, that would be me.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** So we have, first of all, our company is Artis Rademacher and Associates.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** I'm Lori Rademacher we have been running sequences for quite some time now the first step in this sequence that we're having an issue with is a LinkedIn request and then a call and then a text and then an automatic email I put people into this sequence on Thursday and at that same time when I put them in, the whole list of people that I moved there, they skipped.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** I don't know how it happened.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** I don't know if they were moved.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** I don't know how to tell that, but they went directly to the automatic email and they all got an email and I don't know how that happened.

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** I'll have to take a peek here.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** What is your username?

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Lori, L-O-R-E.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** And if you go under sequencing and click overview, what is the name of your sequence?

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** Because I see you have quite a few.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Yep, we do.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** That's why I called because I've never seen this happen before.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** It's TM general sequence.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** TM.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** Okay, I'm going to have to pause this to be able to see what's actually in this sequence.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** Because one thing that happens if you, let's say you made a change to your template and you have a sequence already activated, they're really independent of each other.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** So, yeah, your first step in this sequence is to send an automatic email.

**[2:17] Speaker_01:** And then they go to the pipelines, I'm sorry, a LinkedIn step.

**[2:21] Speaker_01:** okay but when I'm looking at it it says it's LinkedIn so are you in overview like go to overview which is your activated sequence yeah okay I'm in overview and then I have use as template or pause sequence okay so yeah go to just hit overview again because I actually paused it Okay.

**[2:49] Speaker_01:** Because you have to pause the sequence.

**[2:53] Speaker_01:** You can't go in and make changes as it's running.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** So I paused it to even view it.

**[3:00] Speaker_01:** So next to TM general sequence, now that the sequence is paused, if you go to edit branches.

**[3:08] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:11] Speaker_01:** Yeah, the first email is TM general outreach email one.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** Okay, can you tell me how, like, I don't know if you can or not, but can you tell me how that change was made?

**[3:27] Speaker_01:** No, it's just what it was built on.

**[3:30] Speaker_01:** Now, if you made changes, let me go to templates.

**[3:35] Speaker_01:** What template did you use?

**[3:40] Speaker_01:** Looks like general sequence.

**[3:44] Speaker_01:** Let's see.

**[3:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[3:45] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:46] Speaker_01:** So it looks like either, and I really don't have a way to tell which happened.

**[3:54] Speaker_01:** So when you start it, when you make a template, if you activate a sequence, if you go in and change the template, it doesn't have any effect on the sequence that's already activated.

**[4:04] Speaker_01:** Like you could even delete the template.

**[4:05] Speaker_01:** So it could be that it was originally created with that first email as the first step and activated, but then they went into the template.

**[4:17] Speaker_01:** That's going to probably be my guess.

**[4:19] Speaker_01:** And then they took that step out.

**[4:22] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[4:24] Speaker_00:** All right, but you can't tell me who did that.
