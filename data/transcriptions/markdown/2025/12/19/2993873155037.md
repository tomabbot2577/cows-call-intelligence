**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello?

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hey, I'm going through this file.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** And this deals in for Swan Group.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** You've got something here that says $850.

**[0:14] Speaker_01:** And I don't know if that was a typo.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** Their upgrade invoice was only $250.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** Well, let me look.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** Swan Group.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** Which they paid.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** They increased $100 a month, too.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** So we take 100 a month times six months plus the setup.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** No, but they went monthly, though.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Oh, that doesn't matter.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** That has no impact on it.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** Because if they pay annually, we don't get paid on – or no, we do get paid on that.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** But we get paid on six months of it.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** So that's 100 a month times six months plus 250.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** So their monthly invoice is 200.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** And then their upgrade was 250.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** But their old monthly used to be $100, and they went to $200 for a 100-a-month increase.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** So we added $100 a month, and then we multiplied that by six months, and then plus the $250.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** That's how $850 got arrived at.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** Oh, I don't know.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** So that's more commission stuff?

**[1:16] Speaker_00:** Yeah, different commission stuff, like what we count.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** Even if it's a year deal, if they pay normally, we only get credit and paid on the first six months.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:27] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:27] Speaker_01:** So the increase was, so the per month column is the increase in per month.

**[1:34] Speaker_00:** So then that times six plus the setup is how the 850 is set.

**[1:37] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:37] Speaker_01:** So I don't really need to worry about the deals in column for what I'm doing.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** Just make sure they paid and make sure, yeah, the deals in, because that's mixed up.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** That is usually six times the per month field plus the setup is the deals in column.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** You can check the math if you want.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** and it's all cool.

**[1:58] Speaker_01:** I think he just want to know, like, are they paying and stuff?

**[2:02] Speaker_01:** okay.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** So this upgrade invoice was paid 519.

**[2:07] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** Already less paid invoice, less pain, 6, 1, 25.

**[2:18] Speaker_01:** The next one is scheduled for, okay.
