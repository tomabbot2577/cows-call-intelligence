## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** uh uh Hello, you've reached Amy Wynn Emery.

**[0:30] Speaker_01:** I am not available at this time.

**[0:32] Speaker_01:** Please leave your name and number and I will return your call as soon as possible.

**[0:35] Speaker_01:** Thank you and have a great day.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** Hey Amy, it's Jim Lombardo with PCRecruiter.

**[0:47] Speaker_00:** Wanted to give you a quick call here.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** I have owed you a call.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** I have to apologize for my delay.

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** I was out for much of the week of the 8th and have just not even been remotely caught up since.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** So I'm trying to dig out of that hole.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** But I wanted to give a call back to see about getting you set up on PCRM.

**[1:03] Speaker_00:** What it would be, I would get a new data link created and then you could decide who you wanted to give that to and really everybody could use it but since you only have what about a dozen people that you want to use it those are the only people who usually let let know that it's a thing and then we could do it that way um what I could do um want to talk about paperwork getting it upgraded over to you but I wanted to talk about that too and see about that because I think it's like ten bucks a user normally for everybody but we would do it for only the ones you were starting out and kind of just let me know if you needed to increase that.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** But let's talk about it sometime.

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** I'm in all week, and hopefully we can connect.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** 4408560314 is my number.

**[1:48] Speaker_00:** Once again, it's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** 4408560314.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** And usually what we'll do is we will get paperwork out once that's signed and returned.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** We have the new link generated, same username, same passwords, everything like that.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** And then we will put a ticket in to get a trainer in touch and they can get you scheduled Usually within a couple days notice for the first training to get everybody Online there.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** So give me a call me to get a moment and we'll talk to you soon 440-856-0314 Thanks
