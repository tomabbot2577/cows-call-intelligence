**[2:38] Speaker_00:** Like I can't it won't allow me to bring it up.

**[2:48] Speaker_01:** That wouldn't be a piece of recruiter though.

**[2:52] Speaker_01:** Like do you see it in your menu up at the top?

**[2:57] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I see it but you know everything else is kind of lit.

**[3:01] Speaker_00:** Everything else is lit.

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** Like it's sign in is lit and invite attendees or is lit but this one's you know it's dark it's not lit up and you still have the app installed no i don't really use teams and it's not a piece of cruder um issues so i'm trying to figure out um so it's not lit up but you see it okay I definitely, I mean, I see it, but it just won't let me.
