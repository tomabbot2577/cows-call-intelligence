## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** How may I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** Hey, Garrett.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** How are you today?

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** Hey, two quick questions for you.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** One sounds remedial, and I have to apologize.

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** My brain's just not working today.

**[0:17] Speaker_00:** I'm trying to...

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** I know I have form letters within my PCR.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** How do I create a new form letter and attach it to a bunch of people's names.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** So can you walk me through that real fast, like form letters?

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** So you would just go to System in the main menu at the top of PCR.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** Then go to Form Letters on the left.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** Yep.

**[0:43] Speaker_01:** And then go to Name Letters on the right.

**[0:46] Speaker_01:** Yep.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** And then in the bottom frame, you'll see in the Action menu, there's a plus sign to create a new form letter.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** I can't find that.

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** I'm looking for it.

**[0:56] Speaker_00:** That's what I'm looking for.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** I don't care.

**[0:58] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[0:59] Speaker_01:** I'm looking for it.

**[1:02] Speaker_00:** It says names and it says I want to.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** It'll say I want to.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** It'll say format I want to name last modified.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** Usually, where's the plus sign?

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** So it's usually at the top right of the frame.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** If you didn't pin the action button, the plus sign yet, you'd click the three horizontal lines to see your drop-down menu.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** It says add letter.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Jesus goodness.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** There we are.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** Add a letter.

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** There it is.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** Awesome.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** And you just give the letter a name up at the top, and then below you create your form letter.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** Is there like an AI function?

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** Like within LinkedIn, you have an AI function that rewrites stuff for you.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** Does PCR have that yet?

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** I think you don't have that function.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:52] Speaker_01:** So we have released to all of our customers a free trial of the AI features.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** So it's going to be in your database currently.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** It's the AI email generator.

**[2:01] Speaker_01:** So you would want to use that toolbar above the big blank space.
