## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Hello, it's Josh.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Hi.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** I received your voice mail.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Sorry, we missed you earlier.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** Yeah, no worries.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** So I did take a look at that ticket you mentioned, and it kind of seems like that, you know, since it is self-hosted, we usually don't provide that kind of support of extracting the data from your own servers.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** but I did kind of look through that ticket and there is conversation going on between Robin, who's got your support ticket and our tech team and our developers.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** And they're trying to see if there's anything they can pull together to help.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** But usually, you know, we're doing on, on our hosted versions, we have, you know, specific programs that we use to extract things.

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** And so there's, there's things they could pull something together for you, but I will definitely leave a note to Robin that you've been reaching out and seeing if we can get that escalated a little bit, give you a quicker answer on that.

**[1:04] Speaker_01:** I would really appreciate that.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** And even, you know, if you can't extract the data, can you tell me where I would look within the server to find the file to extract the data?

**[1:17] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[1:17] Speaker_00:** Let me make a note of that specifically.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** That's a great point here.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** so yeah the ideal resolution sir would be if you can give me both options option a we extract data for you this is what that cost would be here's when we can deliver option b you extract the data yourself here's where you find that file within the server that we could extract it ourselves perfect okay it does oh you know what let me look over this resumes are so I don't know if this plays into it but there's a note the tech team is talking a little bit techie to the development team but it says something about the resumes are stored encrypted stored encryption so it might not be just like a folder that holds them but I'll double check I'll pass that question along as I'm letting Robin know that you're looking for maybe an escalation to get this answered a little bit quicker.

**[2:22] Speaker_01:** I would really appreciate that.

**[2:24] Speaker_01:** Should I expect maybe to hear from Robin today before the end of the week?

**[2:30] Speaker_01:** When do you anticipate that?

**[2:33] Speaker_00:** Yeah, she might actually have time today to get back to you.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** It looks like we are waiting on the developers in the back-and-forth conversation to give a couple answers on what they can come up with.

**[2:47] Speaker_00:** But, yeah, I would expect something today or tomorrow, some kind of response either from Robin or maybe a developer will reach out to you.

**[2:57] Speaker_01:** Awesome.

**[2:58] Speaker_01:** Thank you so much.

**[3:00] Speaker_01:** I really appreciate the callback and the help.

**[3:02] Speaker_00:** No problem.

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** Have a great rest of your day, and we'll talk to you soon.

**[3:06] Speaker_01:** Sounds good.

**[3:07] Speaker_01:** Thank you.

**[3:08] Speaker_01:** Thanks.
