## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_03:** Thank you for calling SIGMIS Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_03:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_03:** How may I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** Hey, how's it going, Garrett?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** This is Omar with Sanford Rose IC.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** I am currently trying to help someone named Steve Monson with the Monson Group.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** And he seems to be getting just this like random pop-up on whenever he tries to go on anyone's profile and open up their attachments.

**[0:27] Speaker_01:** And it's like a little Java screen, actually, and it says the file, what the file name has been modified.

**[0:35] Speaker_01:** Would you like to upload the changes?

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** And we have been able to determine that all his software is up to date, like the Java, Amazon Coreto, PCR Launcher.

**[0:43] Speaker_01:** We've also verified that this happens with random people, not just files that have been uploaded by any of the coworkers or subordinates.

**[1:00] Speaker_03:** And it also happens, yeah, it also happens with files that he's uploaded himself and he doesn't have any he doesn't have them open anywhere else which is very odd and there have been no changes made to the files that they're talking about okay and this is happening on like you're going to like a name record you go to the attachments tab and then that's where you're opening the attachment or is it in a different okay let me see I'm actually gonna have to look through some of my support tickets see if that was mentioned before so we'll just say the you Yeah, I haven't heard of that one before.

**[2:01] Speaker_03:** I'm not seeing just a quick scan of our support ticket history.

**[2:06] Speaker_03:** I'm not seeing something directly related to that.

**[2:09] Speaker_03:** So what is the – it might be something to do with the MAC setting for the default program to open a certain file type.

**[2:27] Speaker_03:** I wonder if it's like just like opening it one place, but the program doesn't exist.

**[2:30] Speaker_03:** So it opens it and or, you know, not something where it might be bouncing to two programs.

**[2:35] Speaker_03:** And that's why it's saying, oh, it's open somewhere else or being modified or something.

**[2:39] Speaker_03:** so okay I would maybe start there to see what your default programs are set on the Mac to open things like PDFs or whichever file types you're trying on the attachments there okay yeah because it does look like it is being opened with Adobe and we do have Adobe Reader and that is yeah it's defaulting to that.

**[3:06] Speaker_01:** We do have that as the default there.

**[3:07] Speaker_01:** I'm sorry for not specifying that earlier.

**[3:10] Speaker_03:** Okay, good.

**[3:11] Speaker_03:** Okay, gotcha.

**[3:12] Speaker_03:** Okay, so you want it to open with Adobe Reader, and it's inside Adobe Reader where you're getting that pop-up.

**[3:19] Speaker_03:** It seems like an Adobe Reader kind of...

**[3:21] Speaker_01:** It's the pop-up that's actually happening is Java.

**[3:27] Speaker_01:** Am I able to send you like a screenshot or something?

**[3:31] Speaker_03:** Yeah, let's see that.

**[3:33] Speaker_03:** You can just email me at, I'll give you my email address whenever you're ready.
