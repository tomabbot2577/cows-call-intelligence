**[0:43] Speaker_01:** Hello.

**[0:44] Speaker_02:** Is this Beverly?

**[0:46] Speaker_01:** It is, yes.

**[0:47] Speaker_02:** Beverly, it's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:48] Speaker_02:** I'm returning your call.

**[0:49] Speaker_02:** How are you?

**[0:50] Speaker_02:** Good.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:52] Speaker_02:** I am well.

**[0:53] Speaker_02:** I wanted to give you a quick call, see if we couldn't coordinate a demo of PC Recruiter maybe next week, I think you said was best.

**[0:59] Speaker_02:** if we could just get something on the calendar.

**[1:00] Speaker_01:** This is a short week for us.

**[1:03] Speaker_02:** For sure.

**[1:04] Speaker_02:** For sure.

**[1:05] Speaker_02:** Well, what if we did maybe, what is it, Tuesday the 8th?

**[1:09] Speaker_02:** Could you do something that time, maybe mid-morning, like 10.30, 11 o'clock?

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** Let me just look.

**[1:16] Speaker_01:** Tuesday the 8th.

**[1:21] Speaker_01:** I have to just confer with three or four other people.

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** So what time were you thinking of?

**[1:28] Speaker_02:** I was thinking maybe like 10.30 Eastern, if that would work.

**[1:33] Speaker_02:** And why don't I email you that, and then you could kind of confirm if that works or if you need to counter a time.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** I think we usually have a recruiter's meeting at 8.30, so if you could do it at 10 o'clock, that might be better.

**[1:48] Speaker_02:** Sure.

**[1:48] Speaker_02:** Sure.

**[1:50] Speaker_01:** Why don't you send that to me?

**[1:51] Speaker_01:** I gave you my email.

**[1:52] Speaker_01:** Did I not?

**[1:53] Speaker_02:** Yes.

**[1:54] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** So why don't you send that, and then I'll share it with the other people.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** Is this like a Teams call or a Zoom call?

**[2:03] Speaker_02:** A Zoom call.

**[2:04] Speaker_02:** Should I set up a Zoom call and include that dial-in information?

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** We don't dial in.
