**[0:27] Speaker_03:** In the chat area.

**[0:29] Speaker_03:** Yeah, the chat area of the meeting should be down at the bottom right.

**[1:09] Speaker_03:** I want to see if this works.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:12] Speaker_03:** Okay, let's go back to, okay, copy that URL in there.

**[1:24] Speaker_03:** Hit go.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** Oh, that's better.

**[1:34] Speaker_03:** Yeah.

**[1:35] Speaker_03:** I think I just said.

**[1:35] Speaker_01:** Except it doesn't give me the right database.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** It doesn't give me the main.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** ESI underscore main underscore new is the database that I have access to.

**[1:50] Speaker_01:** Oh, wait a minute.

**[1:52] Speaker_02:** Did I pull up the wrong customer?

**[1:54] Speaker_02:** Debbie Schumacher, electronic search.

**[1:57] Speaker_02:** See, like, when I go here, I have this ESI main.

**[2:07] Speaker_01:** I don't have any other login.

**[2:15] Speaker_02:** Is there an electronic search?

**[2:17] Speaker_02:** Can you do me a favor?

**[2:24] Speaker_03:** Can you go ahead and log in there?

**[2:26] Speaker_03:** Sure.

**[2:31] Speaker_03:** Quota system.

**[2:34] Speaker_03:** This usually means it's a database hosted on your own servers.

**[2:37] Speaker_03:** Oh, I don't think you're going to have access to this.

**[2:39] Speaker_03:** Is this a self-hosted, not one that we host?

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** I don't know.

**[2:45] Speaker_01:** It might be self-hosted on our, how do I know?

**[2:51] Speaker_01:** Oh, API.

**[2:52] Speaker_01:** Yeah, but it wouldn't be that.

**[2:54] Speaker_03:** So there's like a link.

**[2:55] Speaker_03:** how it's going to be listed.

**[2:59] Speaker_03:** But you just don't have access to generate the link that we need.

**[3:06] Speaker_01:** Yeah, when I asked my admin, she said I can't go on here.

**[3:13] Speaker_03:** It ends in .txt.

**[3:16] Speaker_01:** Yeah, that's in one of them, but that's not what she gave me.

**[3:22] Speaker_03:** What did she send you?

**[3:23] Speaker_03:** because what you're seeing is kind of like if it's a self-hosted database meaning it's on your own servers what you're seeing is kind of like a master version of the actual path that we need okay just one second let me the url that i asked her was https blah blah pcr.electronicsearch.com okay what they'll need to do somebody that's an administrator because you're you don't have access to it.

**[3:54] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:54] Speaker_03:** If they go under system, I just type the word links in the search box.
