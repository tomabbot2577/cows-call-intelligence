**[0:20] Speaker_00:** Enter your participant ID followed by pound.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** Welcome.

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** You are in the meeting now.

**[0:35] Speaker_00:** You are the first participant.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** Please stand by.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Thank you.

**[1:50] Speaker_04:** Good morning, Brian.

**[1:50] Speaker_04:** Do you hear me?

**[1:51] Speaker_04:** Yeah.

**[1:52] Speaker_01:** Hey, Jim.

**[1:52] Speaker_04:** How's it going?

**[1:53] Speaker_04:** Not bad.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** Not bad.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[1:57] Speaker_02:** Doing all right, man.

**[1:58] Speaker_02:** It's kind of a weird week.

**[1:59] Speaker_02:** we had a big work event on Friday and someone got hit by a car and died.

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** Oh no.

**[2:06] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[2:06] Speaker_02:** So it's a, sorry to bring that up.

**[2:08] Speaker_02:** I've got a little weird headspace here today.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** For sure.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** That certainly is.

**[2:13] Speaker_01:** I hate to see that.

**[2:14] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:14] Speaker_01:** So that's, you know, with that, yeah, it's, I've never had to deal with anything like this before.

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** So we're all kind of going through it together, but I do appreciate you.

**[2:23] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:23] Speaker_01:** You hopping on with me today, man.

**[2:24] Speaker_01:** I'm still excited to talk to you.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** This is a big move for us.

**[2:29] Speaker_01:** We are, just to kind of jump in, sorry, like I said, my head's all over the place here, but not sure if you've done any research on ARCO, but we are a pretty large general contractor.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** We've got north of like 25 recruiters internally.

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** And I think the first thing I want to just explain to you is we very much act like an agency when it comes to recruiting in a way that we have a lot of businesses within ARCO that are all connected, but they operate independently.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** So we might treat one business and have certain workflows in the system.

**[3:00] Speaker_02:** I guess what we're looking to do is be able to treat one business with certain workflows and another business with others.

**[3:06] Speaker_01:** So we're currently on ISIMs right now, if you're familiar with them.

**[3:11] Speaker_01:** Our contract's up with September of next year.

**[3:15] Speaker_01:** It's like 99.9% looking like we're going to move away from them.

**[3:18] Speaker_01:** So we are in the process of vetting other ATSs.

**[3:20] Speaker_01:** This is probably our ninth call, Jim, and me and my colleague are going through this process.

**[3:27] Speaker_01:** I think what we're trying to do is by the end of this month, which is obviously just a short time from now, identify maybe those top three to five platforms that we want to kind of take that next step with as far as, you know, full demos with the rest of our team in the hopes of by the end of this year choosing who we're going to move forward with for implementation next year.

**[3:46] Speaker_01:** Perfect.
