## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_04:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:05] Speaker_04:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_04:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_02:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:07] Speaker_02:** This is Ellen Burke with WorldBridge Partners.

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** How's it going?

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** And I am calling with a problem with PCR, which I cannot figure out.

**[0:18] Speaker_02:** I sent a resume to a client who has always received things from me, and she did not get the resume.

**[0:28] Speaker_02:** so I copied my activity and re-sent it and she got it.

**[0:37] Speaker_02:** Then I sent a second resume and she hasn't received it.

**[0:41] Speaker_02:** So I wanted to just double check and make sure that the problem wasn't on PCR's side.

**[0:48] Speaker_04:** Okay, yeah, I'll take a look.

**[0:49] Speaker_04:** Which database are you in?

**[0:51] Speaker_02:** Valencia.

**[0:55] Speaker_02:** Even though that's not where I am.

**[0:59] Speaker_02:** Got it, Valencia.

**[1:01] Speaker_04:** Okay, and what's your username?

**[1:04] Speaker_02:** Eberk or LNB.

**[1:07] Speaker_02:** Eberk, I think.

**[1:10] Speaker_04:** Oh, LNB.

**[1:12] Speaker_04:** Yeah, LNB was the right one.

**[1:13] Speaker_04:** Perfect.

**[1:15] Speaker_04:** All right, let me check your email connection real quick.

**[1:21] Speaker_04:** Okay, that's in good shape.

**[1:26] Speaker_04:** All right.

**[1:26] Speaker_02:** So let me pull up the...

**[1:30] Speaker_02:** Because when I copied the activity and then re-sent the resume through PCR, she got it.

**[1:37] Speaker_04:** So when you say you're copying the activity, you mean you go to the name record, you pull up the activity...

**[1:42] Speaker_02:** Oh, yeah, because I have a cover letter that goes with the resume.

**[1:46] Speaker_02:** So I copied that and re-sent the resume, and she got it.

**[1:56] Speaker_04:** Okay.

**[1:56] Speaker_02:** Then about five minutes later, ten minutes later, I sent a new resume with a cover letter, and she has not received it.

**[2:05] Speaker_04:** Okay.

**[2:06] Speaker_04:** What is the person's name that you're sending to?

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** Helene, H-E-L-A-I-N-E, Tepperman, T-E-P-E-R-M-A-N.

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:20] Speaker_03:** All right.

**[2:23] Speaker_03:** So let me just take a look at those activities.

**[2:25] Speaker_03:** 26.

**[2:27] Speaker_03:** Got it.

**[2:27] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[2:27] Speaker_02:** Can you see the last one I sent?

**[2:32] Speaker_03:** Wait.

**[2:33] Speaker_04:** Oh, yeah, yeah.

**[2:34] Speaker_04:** So there's one at 916 a.m.

**[2:37] Speaker_04:** and then one at 919 a.m.

**[2:39] Speaker_04:** that was sent.

**[2:40] Speaker_04:** Right.

**[2:41] Speaker_02:** Four minutes later.
