## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello, this is Kim.

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** We received your voicemail.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** You're interested in the AI.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** Awesome.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** How are you doing?

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:12] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[0:14] Speaker_00:** Now, it's my understanding this is a free service at this time, correct?

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** Yes, we have a free trial out to all of our customers.

**[0:24] Speaker_01:** We would just need your PCR contract signer to request that AI search or AI candidate match are added to your free trial.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** It looks like your contract signer is, let's see, Jackie Bandish.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** We would just need an email from her.

**[0:46] Speaker_01:** You could send it to support at main sequence dot net.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** But, yeah, we would just look over your database and see if any updates need to be made.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** We would kind of give you all heads up on what those updates would be.

**[1:01] Speaker_01:** It would mostly just be a kind of a reindex that you wouldn't even hardly notice so that the new features can be plugged in and installed.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** Do you know how long this is going to be free to users?

**[1:18] Speaker_01:** So, yeah, the management hasn't really indicated to us how long they want to let the free trial ride.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** I imagine it'll be for a while because they haven't decided on a date to end it.

**[1:29] Speaker_01:** But we will give everyone a heads up in advance if it's going to be cut off or ending.

**[1:35] Speaker_01:** So you can make a decision if you want to keep it and pay for it or just let it expire.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** And do you have a ballpark as to have you guys discussed what the pricing will be?

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** Oh, yes.

**[1:50] Speaker_01:** So the pricing is part of one of the PCR packages.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** That kind of changes based on where you are currently in your contract, what you're currently paying.

**[2:02] Speaker_01:** So we could always have our sales rep, Jim Lombardo, reach out to you and discuss your options based on how your current contract is set up.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** If you do feel like you want to move forward with adding AI.

**[2:17] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:17] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** I'll let Jackie know about this.

**[2:22] Speaker_00:** I had seen it.

**[2:23] Speaker_00:** I saw the update on there today.

**[2:25] Speaker_00:** I know you guys have been doing some work, so I saw it and I watched the videos and things like that.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** So I'm not even sure that Jackie's aware that it's there.

**[2:32] Speaker_00:** But so I just wanted to gather as much information as possible before I, you know, relayed information to her.

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** Yeah, that makes sense.

**[2:40] Speaker_01:** Just have her send us an email.

**[2:43] Speaker_01:** I think on that blog post you were referencing, there's like even a sign-up form that she could just fill in her name and email and we'll get the process rolling for your account.

**[2:55] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I did see something there too.

**[2:57] Speaker_00:** When I went back, I couldn't find it, but I can try to either just email or we'll fill out that form and we're good.

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** How long do you think it takes once we set everything in motion?

**[3:08] Speaker_01:** It should be turned on within two or three days is what we've seen so far for each account.
