## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_04:** Thank you for calling MainSuite for Technology.

**[0:02] Speaker_04:** This is Tyler.

**[0:03] Speaker_04:** How can I help you?

**[0:05] Speaker_02:** Hey, Tyler.

**[0:05] Speaker_02:** This is Michael from United Employment.

**[0:07] Speaker_02:** You were helping us get Portal on here?

**[0:09] Speaker_04:** Yeah.

**[0:10] Speaker_04:** How's it going?

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** Not good.

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** So, I mean, we're not computer people at all, and this is a new computer.

**[0:17] Speaker_02:** I don't know if it's because of the Outlook version or something that's popping up or not, but I got it to the point where it did the launcher or it did the – I downloaded it, and then it went through like the different phases.

**[0:30] Speaker_02:** You saw like the little bar go get full, and then it said finish, but there was nowhere to put the portal license in.

**[0:39] Speaker_02:** I went into the options, into Outlook.

**[0:41] Speaker_02:** I can't even find it.

**[0:42] Speaker_02:** So I don't know if you can hop on here again.

**[0:44] Speaker_04:** Yeah, so you probably opened the new Outlook and not the classic Outlook.

**[0:49] Speaker_02:** Yeah, I don't even know how to turn that off.

**[0:50] Speaker_02:** So whatever is not working here.

**[0:53] Speaker_02:** It automatically goes.

**[0:57] Speaker_02:** I can't seem to get it off the computer because it seems to open two versions of it.

**[1:00] Speaker_02:** If you click on it, it opens up the new version.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** Yeah, let me do...

**[1:09] Speaker_04:** Should I send the email to Scott's email?

**[1:11] Speaker_02:** Yeah, well, I got that email, but I don't think the email helps.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** I mean, I pay for the service.

**[1:15] Speaker_02:** Can you just jump on here?

**[1:16] Speaker_02:** No, for a meeting link.

**[1:18] Speaker_02:** Oh, yeah, that's fine.

**[1:19] Speaker_04:** Yeah, that's what I said.

**[1:20] Speaker_04:** I was sending over a meeting link to hop on again.

**[1:57] Speaker_04:** And you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window.

**[2:20] Speaker_04:** Share the screen.

**[2:38] Speaker_04:** Yep.

**[2:56] Speaker_04:** Alright.

**[3:14] Speaker_04:** Go ahead and I'm going to ask for remote control here.

**[3:35] Speaker_04:** Oh, I see what happened.

**[3:54] Speaker_04:** All right, this will be a quick fix for us.

**[4:14] Speaker_04:** Thank you.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[3:32] Speaker_00:** It should hopefully let me...

**[3:40] Speaker_04:** Excuse me.

**[3:44] Speaker_04:** Oh, it's not going to let me...

**[3:49] Speaker_04:** Oh, there it goes.

**[3:50] Speaker_04:** Just took a second.

**[3:51] Speaker_02:** And I can cut and paste from the email you sent us if you want.

**[3:54] Speaker_04:** Yeah, go ahead and do that.

**[3:56] Speaker_04:** I'll let you take back over.

**[3:58] Speaker_04:** Nope, don't hit cancel.

**[4:00] Speaker_04:** I can just type it in.

**[4:02] Speaker_04:** It's fine.
