## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** This is Tyler.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** How can I help you?

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Hey, Tyler.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** It's Scott.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** I was just talking to you a little while ago.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** We were trying to set up my portal.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** I got a quick question for you while my boss is trying to figure that password and stuff out.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** Am I able to – I've always done it this way.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** I've always sent myself the resume through email and then gone and clicked on and parsed a resume.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** Am I able to somehow or another just go into my desktop files or file folder and upload a resume into PCR or bring it over and parse it that way somehow?

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** Yes.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** If you click the lightning bolt up at the top right-hand corner of PC Recruiter.

**[0:49] Speaker_01:** Gotcha.

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** Do name.

**[0:52] Speaker_01:** You'll see a parse from resume option.

**[0:53] Speaker_01:** uh yep okay and that should open up like a separate box okay then you could hit open okay and select the file okay all right perfect that's what i'll do that in the meantime until we figure out this other issue yep and you might want to try it real quick while we're on the phone oh okay Because if you don't see that extra box pop up, you're going to need your IT to install two more programs on that computer for you.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Yeah, wonderful.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** I got a box, contact, add resume, utility.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** Is there another box after that that's popping up?

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** yes yes it does where it has like open on the bottom left of it yep perfect this has got stuff on it I just have to find my resume file but it looks like it looks like it'll work here perfect yeah yeah yeah so yeah so he's gonna try to what you know he's beside himself right now with all the computer issues, but he'll, we'll come back to the portal issue later.

**[2:15] Speaker_01:** Yep.

**[2:16] Speaker_01:** But yeah, you can at least do it that way for now.

**[2:18] Speaker_01:** Just download it and then.

**[2:19] Speaker_00:** The only thing I can't do is if I want to send a hiring manager, like a email with a resume or something like that, obviously I can't do that right now.

**[2:28] Speaker_00:** Well, you can do it through a PC recruiter.

**[2:31] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:32] Speaker_00:** You still can do it through there.

**[2:33] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:34] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:34] Speaker_00:** I guess you're right.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:37] Speaker_00:** I don't know.

**[2:38] Speaker_00:** It's all new to me because it's been changed a little bit here.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** Yeah, kind of just working with a workaround for the time being.

**[2:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah, yeah.

**[2:46] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:47] Speaker_00:** I'll figure it all out.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[2:50] Speaker_00:** Thank you, Tyler.

**[2:52] Speaker_00:** Yep, no problem.
