## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** This is Tyler.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** How can I help you?

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Hey, Tyler.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** This is Eric at Comcentric.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** Hey, how's it going, Eric?

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** I had an issue come up yesterday.

**[0:14] Speaker_00:** I don't know if it's an inhaler issue or if Monster changed the format of the resumes that are coming in.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** But I'm getting an exception error when I try to use the inhaler application as of yesterday.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** So I don't know if you can help me troubleshoot that or if you experienced anything on your end or heard anything on your end.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** I haven't heard anything on my end.

**[0:38] Speaker_01:** Let's hop on a quick screen share so I can see that error.

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** Because more than likely it's just the formatting of their resumes.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** Because I know I do change stuff quite often.

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** Let me start up a video leading here.

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** Yeah, the inhaler won't even operate at all, which is weird.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** Usually if they change the format, it'll put them in a bad folder or something, which isn't an error I'm getting.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** Where do I need to go?

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** Is it a website I think I go to?

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** I'm just emailing you the link here.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** Just send that link on over to you.

**[1:20] Speaker_02:** Gotcha.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** I know we were having some emails, issues with Monster because they're merging with career builder so that's one of the issues and then as soon as we got the resumes to start sending then they won't inhale yeah one thing all right we can't access your microphone you could just exit out of that no just makes it out of that we're already on the phone here okay and then just do the continue without audio and then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window to share, you want to share your entire screen.

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[2:30] Speaker_01:** All righty.

**[2:32] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:33] Speaker_01:** Now, you have it going to a forward?

**[2:37] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:37] Speaker_00:** So here's the folder.

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** It has all these resumes.

**[2:43] Speaker_00:** Here's the first batch that came in at 1233.

**[2:46] Speaker_00:** These ones inhaled fine.

**[2:47] Speaker_00:** And then there was a delay in Monster for like an hour.

**[2:50] Speaker_00:** and then these 63 showed up.

**[2:58] Speaker_00:** Actually, they were delayed, but they showed up, and it showed that they were received beforehand or sent earlier.

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** It's weird because it's showing they were sent, but they weren't received until later, so I don't know, they got slowed down through the Internet somewhere.

**[3:10] Speaker_00:** But anyway, they're in this folder.

**[3:11] Speaker_00:** They should inhale, right?

**[3:12] Speaker_00:** So if I go to the inhaler app, I restarted and made sure there was no issues.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** I also ran an update on the inhaler to make sure that something didn't change with the inhaler.

**[3:23] Speaker_00:** Mapped it, remapped it to the folder just to make sure if something broke with the link.

**[3:27] Speaker_00:** None of those things fixed it.

**[3:28] Speaker_00:** So if I go here to import from email now, you'll see this exception pops up.

**[3:33] Speaker_00:** If you click the details, here is the...

**[3:40] Speaker_00:** Scroll down if you want so you can see the whole thing or I can copy it to a message.

**[3:45] Speaker_00:** Have you seen this before?

**[3:50] Speaker_01:** I have not.

**[3:54] Speaker_01:** Go ahead and scroll down in there for me.
