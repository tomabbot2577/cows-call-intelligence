**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Good morning, this is Jim.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** Hey, Jim, it's Tyler.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Good morning, Tyler.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Not too bad, not too bad.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Hey, quick question about that ticket you just put in.

**[0:12] Speaker_01:** Mm-hmm.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** So what do you mean by PC recruiter email?

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** I have no idea.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** I've never worked with the woman.

**[0:23] Speaker_00:** I've never talked to her.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** Her voicemail said, I need to see if I could get some help hooking my email up to the mobile device.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** And she said a PC recruiter email, so maybe it's PCR mail, or it could just be something that – I think it's just her email, because PCR mail, you can't hook up to anything.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** Yeah, it's just her email, but we don't really – like, our mobile app doesn't work with email.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** No, it uses whatever email you have set up on your device.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** yeah so I don't know even if there's anything we can do but just as a courtesy I wanted to throw in a ticket so someone could call and say oh yeah we can't do that or if it's easy maybe we can I don't know but she was just sounded really like really nice and she's like I just need some help it was a cane customer I've never worked with so I didn't know much gotcha okay I felt it looks like they use vario for their email so I'll give her a call and send her these instructions but But yeah, that's not like a – I don't think we're going to be able to do anything with that.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** I didn't think so, but I thought I'd throw it in just to be nice to her.

**[1:26] Speaker_00:** Okay, perfect.

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page there.

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I didn't think there was anything we could do, but just it was a voicemail, so I wanted to respond.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** All right, perfect.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** I'll give her a call.

**[1:35] Speaker_00:** Thanks, sir.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** Bye.

**[1:37] Speaker_00:** Bye.

**[1:37] Speaker_00:** Bye.
