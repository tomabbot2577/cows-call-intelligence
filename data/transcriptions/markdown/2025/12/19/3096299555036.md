## 📝 Summary

There is an issue with SourceWale where it incorrectly marks a person as added by one recruiter when they were actually added by another. The correct setting needs to be adjusted in SourceWale. A survey can be created through PCR, but it must be sent to people who are already in the database and cannot be sent to random people. It may be better to create a hidden webpage on the company website where people can fill out the survey and then notify via email when completed.

**Issue Type:** general
**Resolution:** pending
**Follow-up Required:** No ✅

## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Seekers Technology.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** This is Tyler.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** How can I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Hey, I have a couple questions.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** Number one, this morning on our team meeting, we were looking at a sample person's profile, and it said one recruiter had added that person to a roll-off, but it was not.

**[0:29] Speaker_01:** It was a different recruiter who added it.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** What was the name of the test record?

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** Let me look.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** Let me write it down.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** And the other piece to that, they said something about in SourceWale, like once they contact somebody and it stops the campaign, it marks it like the red X in the PCR roll-up.

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** Does that sound right?

**[0:56] Speaker_00:** So that would be however you have it set up in SourceWale.

**[1:01] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** So I may have to go adjust the setting in there because we're using that red X as, like, if our researcher pulls people for a job and puts them in a funnel roll-up, and then the recruiter goes through and, like, audits them and pulls the people they want to keep into the master one, and the other ones they mark with a red X.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** so the researcher knows they're a no and so the people from source wheel are coming it's like marking them red x like they're a no but they're not necessarily a no so yeah that would be in the source integration setup okay i will look into that piece then um let me show you a sheet bill And then I'm going to spell the last name, M-C-G-I-L-L-I-V-R-A-Y.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** All right, let me take a look at this record.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** So where were you seeing that they were added?

**[2:16] Speaker_01:** Yeah, let me pull this up here one sec.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** So if you go under roll-ups, it says added by Marcus, but Lisa added this person.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** Into the database?

**[2:38] Speaker_01:** Onto a roll-up.

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** So the add name activity is who created the record.

**[2:49] Speaker_01:** Oh, okay.

**[2:50] Speaker_01:** Then why does it say it was yesterday?

**[2:53] Speaker_01:** Because this person has been in there.

**[2:58] Speaker_01:** As far as I know.

**[3:00] Speaker_01:** Because if you look back under activities, there are activities in here.

**[3:04] Speaker_01:** Canada was created in 2021.

**[3:08] Speaker_00:** The record I'm looking at was created 9-21-2025.

**[3:20] Speaker_00:** Oh, September 21st.

**[3:24] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:24] Speaker_01:** We're looking at that wrong then.

**[3:27] Speaker_01:** I think we said September 21.

**[3:30] Speaker_01:** We were reading that as 2020.

**[3:32] Speaker_01:** Never mind.

**[3:33] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:33] Speaker_01:** That makes sense.

**[3:34] Speaker_01:** So that was yesterday.

**[3:36] Speaker_01:** That answers that piece.

**[3:38] Speaker_01:** But Lisa added the person.

**[3:43] Speaker_01:** So why does it say Marcus added the person?

**[3:46] Speaker_01:** Because Marcus said he did do some work last night, but it was after the time.

**[3:51] Speaker_01:** And Lisa was like, I was in there getting marked.

**[3:56] Speaker_01:** So I see things by Lisa, like other...

**[4:02] Speaker_00:** But the name record was added by Marcus.

**[4:06] Speaker_01:** But it wasn't is what I'm saying.

**[4:09] Speaker_01:** And we don't know why it was marked Marcus instead of Lisa.

**[4:22] Speaker_01:** It's another source whale thing?

**[4:25] Speaker_01:** Because it says Marcus added a source whale.

**[4:27] Speaker_01:** Okay.
