## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Tom Brown.

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Hey, Tom.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** It's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Hey, good, Jim.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** Boy, it's been years since we've talked.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** How are you doing?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** It has.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I'm very well.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** I'm very well.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** I wanted to reach out and kind of see how I could help.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:14] Speaker_01:** So I've retired from the business, and I've changed my email around, so I don't need the PCR mail anymore.

**[0:25] Speaker_01:** and probably in a month I'll want to shut down PCR.

**[0:32] Speaker_01:** I just wanted to talk with you and see how we go about doing that.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** For sure, for sure.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** So what I could do is I could put in a ticket to get that email taken off and that would drop it from $69.90 down to just $49.95 for the next payment.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** It goes through on the 3rd, so it'll go through a week from Friday.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** And that'll cover you for October.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** and then once you know the date you'd like to cancel, like if you want to cancel October 31, send me an email sometime early October saying, I need to cancel my account effective this date.

**[1:02] Speaker_00:** And then I would put in a ticket to get the cancellation kind of handled, get that taken care of.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** Do you need a data return?

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** Actually, do you want to take the data with you or no?

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** Probably not.

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** At first I was thinking of doing that and then I thought, Well, I could probably just download the phone numbers that I might need into an Excel spreadsheet, and that should probably suffice.

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** Yeah, the data return wouldn't be something you could open to query a phone number or something.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** It's more if you needed to take the data into PC Recruiter or another software down the line.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** Yeah, okay.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so you would just export a roll-up list with emails, phone numbers, anything like that.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, what I can do is if you want, I'll put in the ticket today to drop the email, and then I will wait to hear from you with an email when you're ready to cancel and then when that happens, I'll put in the ticket to get that going.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** Okay, sounds good.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** Jim, what's your email address?

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** It's jim, J-I-M, at mainsequence.net.

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:06] Speaker_01:** Sounds great.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** All right, thanks, Jim.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Thank you, sir.

**[2:10] Speaker_00:** We'll talk to you soon.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** All right, take care.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** Bye.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** Bye.
