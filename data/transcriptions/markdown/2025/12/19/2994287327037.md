**[0:31] Speaker_01:** oh you Thank you for calling SearchMax.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** If you know your party's extension, you may dial it at any time.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** For the operator, press 0.

**[0:41] Speaker_01:** For the dial-by-name directory, press 9.

**[1:00] Speaker_01:** Hello?

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** Hi, Adam.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** It's Robin Mantoni from Main Sequence.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[1:07] Speaker_01:** Good, Robin.

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** I had a message to give you a call.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** What can I help you with?

**[1:13] Speaker_01:** Is my card not on file with you guys?

**[1:15] Speaker_00:** Well, let's see.

**[1:18] Speaker_00:** Let me make sure.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** I've got to note that this is a billing issue.

**[1:21] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** So here's what, yeah.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** So we used to have, we did, but we moved to a new billing system.

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** So the new billing system requires that you kind of put in the details again.

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** Do you mind, like, forwarding me the email with, like, the stuff on it?

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Hold on one second.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** And here's what I'm going to do because one of them got a late fee.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** I'm going to take that off.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** Hold on one second.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** I'm going to do that.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** So what's probably best that I do for you is send you an invite to what's called a customer billing portal with this Biller Genie site that we're now using.

**[1:58] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** In there, you can set up your card on file.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** You can view your invoices.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** So I'm going to send it now to Adam.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** Search Max Inc.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** Hold on one second.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** Adam at MRISearchMax.com, right?

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** That one works too.

**[2:20] Speaker_01:** Yep.

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** That's the one that we have for – oops, I might be sending this to you twice.

**[2:25] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** That's fine.

**[2:26] Speaker_00:** That is the email we have with your billing.

**[2:30] Speaker_00:** So when you get that invite, you'll want to go into it, but you'll want to create the account first.

**[2:37] Speaker_00:** But make sure you use Adam at MRISearchMax.com.

**[2:40] Speaker_00:** You got it.

**[2:41] Speaker_00:** You should do the sign-up.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** Okay?

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** You got it.
