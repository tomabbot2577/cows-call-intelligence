**[0:18] Speaker_02:** And I have downloaded it and I've tried to do it and I can't get it to work.

**[0:24] Speaker_02:** So I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

**[0:26] Speaker_02:** and so like after I download it I enter the data that I had on previous the previous computer but then it doesn't like give me the option to even look at it or view it in the screen um in Outlook and administrator uh I don't know I just installed the the when you were installing the program when you were installing the add-in?

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** Were you prompted for like an administrator password of your computer?

**[1:00] Speaker_02:** I don't know.

**[1:18] Speaker_02:** I uninstalled it and then tried to reinstall it, and it still enters the license code that I have or the serial number.

**[1:27] Speaker_02:** So it still remembers it.

**[1:29] Speaker_02:** So I don't know if I can like fix what you're talking about.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** Well, the other thing is it may, it's not giving you like an invalid or expired message, right?

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** I'll just get the connection.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** We'll figure it out though.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** I'm going to send you.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** Do you have any of RingCentral?

**[1:57] Speaker_02:** RingCentral.

**[1:59] Speaker_02:** No, I don't think I have that on this computer.

**[2:01] Speaker_00:** I'm going to just send you a Google Meet invite then.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** You can get an email from me in just a moment.

**[2:08] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:36] Speaker_00:** Now when you get that meeting invite and you go to join the meeting, it'll ask you about sharing your camera possibly and joining audio.

**[2:46] Speaker_00:** We won't need either of those because we're on the phone.

**[2:58] Speaker_02:** We also don't need to share camera because we're going to be sharing screen instead.

**[3:10] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[4:09] Speaker_00:** I've not got it yet.

**[3:16] Speaker_02:** I think I can go to spam.

**[3:24] Speaker_02:** Does it usually take a minute or two?

**[3:28] Speaker_00:** Not too long.

**[3:31] Speaker_00:** I'm sending it directly from my Gmail account.

**[3:33] Speaker_02:** All right, let me see if I went to spam.

**[3:42] Speaker_00:** It's possible since it has a link in it.

**[3:45] Speaker_02:** Yeah, since it's from a Gmail.
