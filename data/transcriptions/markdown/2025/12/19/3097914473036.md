## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello?

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** Hi, Hugh.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** I had a question about you.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Hi, how are you doing?

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** I'm good.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** How are you doing?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** I'm sorry, I didn't hear your first name again.

**[0:12] Speaker_01:** Robin Mantoni.

**[0:14] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** The question I had was, you know, I go on to pay when you send me the email.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** But the company continues to demand me leave my payment information in their system, and I will not do that.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** I cannot do that, and it's simply because my bank won't pay it.

**[0:40] Speaker_00:** I have been hacked.

**[0:41] Speaker_00:** Since my wife was killed, I've been hacked.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** Four years after she died, she spent $800,000.

**[0:48] Speaker_00:** so I had to file a bankruptcy for her four years after she died so the bank has tightened me down okay I have that turned off for you now so it won't require that you save it okay because my bank when I try and pay it electronically they send you an invitation you have to accept that invitation and that's not happened so they're going to send you a check now I will go in there and see if I can terminate that check process because it's really delayed like September 30th.

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** They won't even send it until September 30th.

**[1:27] Speaker_00:** So I'll try and terminate that if I can go back on that.

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** Go back in here.

**[1:37] Speaker_02:** Yeah, I would probably make sure you did.

**[1:39] Speaker_02:** Yeah, probably go.

**[1:40] Speaker_02:** If you were in the invoice, go out and go back in.

**[1:43] Speaker_02:** I have it turned off now.

**[1:44] Speaker_02:** View pay.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** If I could keep that, then I can make these payments and make it quicker.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** And yeah, I would really appreciate that.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** Because again, my bank, like recurring, they will not do it.

**[2:05] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[2:06] Speaker_02:** All right.

**[2:07] Speaker_02:** Yeah, the auto pay was turned off from what I saw.

**[2:12] Speaker_02:** But the required stored card was not.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** They won't do that.

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** My bank will – I mean, I had another one today.

**[2:21] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[2:22] Speaker_02:** As a matter of fact, my water bill was exactly – Yeah, it should have been for a car but not require auto pay.

**[2:29] Speaker_02:** Now I have both of those off, though.

**[2:31] Speaker_00:** Yeah, that's worked because, like I said, my bank just won't pay it.

**[2:34] Speaker_00:** I get these notices on my phone all the time.

**[2:38] Speaker_00:** So I have to go back in and try and make another payment.

**[2:41] Speaker_00:** Call the bank and let them know that's a valid debit.

**[2:44] Speaker_00:** You've got to let it go through.

**[2:45] Speaker_00:** So it's just a pain in the rear end because they've had to pay so much.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** I get hacked, and I change banks and change cards.

**[2:54] Speaker_00:** I had to reincorporate into the corporation, everything, and it's just – the banker finally told me, he said, Hugh, if they've got your information, they've got your information.

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** He doesn't – he stopped changing banks and accounts.
