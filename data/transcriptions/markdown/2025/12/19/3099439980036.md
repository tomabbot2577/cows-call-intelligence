**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello.

**[0:02] Speaker_02:** Hello.

**[0:02] Speaker_02:** I don't know what's going on there.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I don't know.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** I mean, I was getting sounds out of my computer, but not on the call.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** I did send you a Zoom thing if you want to try that.

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** Oh, you can just go back into the link that I sent you, but then just like mute the audio.

**[0:18] Speaker_02:** We just will use the phone.

**[0:21] Speaker_02:** But go back into the link?

**[0:23] Speaker_02:** Yeah, just when you join, don't join with camera or microphone.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:28] Speaker_02:** And then we'll just use it to share screen.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** Mine just said camera failed.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** You want me to turn off the microphone here, right?

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** Otherwise, you sometimes might get some interference, like some echoing, which is really bad.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** You know, when I went in, my speakers worked.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** I hear a jing, you know, like a computer sound.
