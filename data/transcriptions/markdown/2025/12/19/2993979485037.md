**[0:39] Speaker_00:** Hey, Eric.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:40] Speaker_00:** I'm doing well.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** Thanks for joining me today.

**[0:48] Speaker_00:** I wanted to kind of show you around the PCRM a little bit, talk about some of the new functionality that is included in that.

**[0:56] Speaker_00:** I'm gonna kind of share my screen here in a moment.

**[1:02] Speaker_00:** Okay, meetings being recorded, that's cool.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** Alright, okay so let me share my screen.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** And the PCRM product, so a little background of the PCRM.

**[1:14] Speaker_00:** This was originally going to be a redesign of PC Recruiter.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** So it was originally started a couple of years ago, several years ago now probably, as simply a new interface.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** And what happened is we were going through and developing and adding and taking suggestions and kind of figuring out what people wanted and needed in the software package.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** It ended up including quite a lot of CRM functionality.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** And then we ended up adding a whole new deals pipeline, like a sales pipeline, sales funnel, if you will, and also a simpler sequencing tool, making it a little bit easier to use that way.

**[1:47] Speaker_00:** So we added that into the newly formatted system and beginning of this year it was decided by our ownership team that we were actually going to spin it out as a separate product now right now it's a separate product that shares the same database as PC recruiter so what that means is you could utilize both PC recruiter as you do now along with PCRM real-time updates it's sharing the same everything but it's just a different interface like I said the PCRM products is going to add the deals pipeline, it's going to have some simple sequencing, easier record entry, some a lot of new formatting and new UI.

**[2:28] Speaker_00:** One thing it doesn't quite have but will next week, I saw it yesterday, the Boolean searching wasn't quite up to par in PCRM but it has been worked out and it's going to be released I believe next week.

**[2:41] Speaker_00:** So that's being addressed as well.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** So to kind of show you a little bit around it, Basically what happens is there's a menu bar down the left side of the screen.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** So that's going to give you the ability to have larger area on your screen, more information, and rather than a top and a bottom, it's a left and a right.

**[2:58] Speaker_00:** So you're going to have a lot of the same things you're used to.

**[3:00] Speaker_00:** The names, the companies, the positions, roll-ups, schedule, sequences, activities.

**[3:06] Speaker_00:** So a lot of these are the same information, the same buttons, the same tiles, if you will.

**[3:11] Speaker_00:** You'll notice deals workflow is different.

**[3:14] Speaker_00:** So that's a new one that's been added in there.

**[3:16] Speaker_00:** They've added a kind of new support.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** So they've added a couple of new things here and there.

**[3:20] Speaker_00:** Some of them will look the same, like if you look at schedule, that looks pretty much the same, just kind of made into PCRM.

**[3:28] Speaker_00:** But some of these elements are going to be quite different.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** But what we've done is we've set up PCRM to be easier to use, easier to pick up for a new user, for someone just starting out using it.

**[3:37] Speaker_00:** And if you get familiar and comfortable with how to use the name screen, going to the company screen and the position screen is going to work the same exact way.

**[3:46] Speaker_00:** So when you're clicking in, you're going to have a search at the top.

**[3:50] Speaker_00:** So if you wanted a search like Jim Lombardo, I could do first, second, hit my search.

**[3:55] Speaker_00:** I can easily search any of my fields.

**[3:58] Speaker_00:** I can click into a more Boolean-y search as well.

**[4:00] Speaker_00:** Or by default, it's going to show when I click into, it's going to show the last 50, I think so, records that I looked at.

**[4:08] Speaker_00:** So I'm to be able to see all that information showing right there.

**[4:12] Speaker_00:** And what we've added in this grid.

**[4:13] Speaker_01:** So what you're saying, the Boolean search, the Boolean search is within PCRM?

**[4:19] Speaker_01:** Is that what you're saying?
