## 📝 Summary

This conversation appears to be an internal discussion between two people (Stacey and another person) about issues they are experiencing with a CRM system called PCRM. They discuss various problems such as:

1. A bug that is causing the location field to not populate correctly.
2. The need for a permission setting to be added in order to restrict non-mobbing users from seeing other people's deals.
3. The upcoming update which will include customizable grid views and other features.
4. Stacey's frustration with using PCRM due to its complexity compared to their previous CRM system.

Throughout the conversation, they discuss potential workarounds for these issues and plan to follow up on them after a vacation.
