## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** This is Tyler.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** How can I help you?

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Hi, good morning, Tyler.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** This is Sonia Ippoliti calling from Princeton Legal Search Group.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** How are you doing today?

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** I'm doing well.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** I have a question for you about automations and as they apply to a roll-up.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** So I have team members.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** They're working on roll-ups.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** They're using stages.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** and what I would like to have happen is when they log a particular stage, which logs an activity, I want that to trigger an email to go out.

**[0:40] Speaker_00:** So I went into automations.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** I got my form letter.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** I went to create an automation that I could then, you know, attach to the roll-up stages global settings.

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** and I'm not sure I'm understanding.

**[1:00] Speaker_00:** So when I created the automation, let me just go to it.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** You know, I want the email to go to the record, to the name on the record.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** And the only option I was given that somewhat resembled that was like record email.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** Correct.

**[1:20] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:21] Speaker_00:** So what is record email?

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** That would be the primary email address on the record.

**[1:28] Speaker_01:** So whatever's in the email address field.

**[1:32] Speaker_02:** Got it.

**[1:34] Speaker_02:** Got it.

**[1:36] Speaker_02:** So.

**[1:44] Speaker_02:** Yeah, so you have yours labeled.

**[1:47] Speaker_01:** It looks like personal email.

**[1:50] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[1:50] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[1:51] Speaker_01:** So that's the predefined email address field that we'll go to.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** Yours is just labeled personal email.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[2:01] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** I see.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, so we differentiate.

**[2:08] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so we differentiate because we also use this as like a CRM.

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** So we use the primary email field.

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** We label it personal email and we use it for candidates.

**[2:19] Speaker_00:** and then we have a custom email field for our business development purpose like purposes for client contacts and so it we would not be able to use that custom field for this automation correct the automations can only run off the roll-up list automations can only roll run off of predefined fields got it so So what I could do, however, is I could make that primary email field one that is used for either, quote unquote, our candidates or clients.

**[3:00] Speaker_00:** And just if it was for a candidate, we would need to put in a personal email.

**[3:05] Speaker_00:** If it was for a client, we would need to put in a work email.

**[3:07] Speaker_00:** Correct.

**[3:08] Speaker_01:** Yeah, you could do it that way.

**[3:10] Speaker_00:** And then I could run it that way.

**[3:12] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[3:13] Speaker_00:** Got it.
