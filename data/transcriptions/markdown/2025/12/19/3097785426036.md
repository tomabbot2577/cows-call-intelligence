## 📝 Summary

It looks like we had a long conversation about using PC Recruiter with the new Outlook version, creating custom reports, and exporting data in different formats. I'll summarize the key points for you:

* You created a custom report called "Custom Applicant Tracking Client Report" to view pipeline records for a specific job.
* The report allowed you to filter by position ID, date range, and group interviews.
* You also discussed the difference between this report and another one that was previously created, which had more fields available for filtering and a different export format.
* Unfortunately, the new Outlook version does not support PC Recruiter's portal add-in, so you may need to use the classic version installed on your Windows computer.

If you have any further questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask!

## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_02:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:03] Speaker_02:** This is Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Hi, Robin.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** This is Gretchen O'Brien.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** We use PC Recruiter, obviously.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** I've been going back and forth with Tyler about something I'm trying to do, but I'm not sure if you can help me over the phone.

**[0:24] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:25] Speaker_02:** What's going on?

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** I am trying to create a report that captures all of the activities and candidates in a pipeline.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** And so I went in and I followed the instructions for the new pipeline report.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** And I thought I put in everything I needed to.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** And then when I went to export into an Excel, it didn't have any information.

**[1:02] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** Let's see.

**[1:10] Speaker_01:** You're a king and bishop, right?

**[1:16] Speaker_01:** Mm-hmm.

**[1:31] Speaker_02:** I'm just looking at the ticket.

**[1:33] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:37] Speaker_02:** Okay, so here you do the custom, I'm sorry, not the custom report, but the just the regular, and you're in King and Bishop database, right?

**[1:47] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[1:48] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:49] Speaker_02:** Let me see.

**[1:51] Speaker_02:** so when you go to run that report what filters are you using okay so I I put all of the steps in the moment let me just pull it up okay if you don't need all the steps you don't have to even select them so under when you go into the report where it says search params under that heading what is the date range that you're using?

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** August 18th to today.

**[2:19] Speaker_02:** Okay so that'll only pull a step if it's got that that option and then you have some activities and then where it says filter by job status what is the status are you nearing it by a particular position?

**[2:36] Speaker_02:** Yeah, so underneath filters you can narrow by a particular job if you want and you probably want to use position ID rather than title if you're looking for a particular job.

**[2:54] Speaker_02:** And then if the jobs already closed or filled you'll need to clear out the filter by job status.

**[3:01] Speaker_02:** But you don't have to narrow by any steps if you want all of them.

**[3:07] Speaker_02:** I want all of them.

**[3:09] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[3:11] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[3:11] Speaker_00:** So when I'm looking at that, it's just I clicked the new pipeline template for the pipeline.

**[3:23] Speaker_00:** And then I clicked inbox active out of process.

**[3:26] Speaker_02:** Well, if you want everything, you won't even need to do that.

**[3:30] Speaker_02:** okay so do i yeah that's if you're just wanting to limit um so it sounds like to me you want to make sure you have the right date range you want to not pick anything for filter by step type or name activity um not do anything there yeah not clear everything out of there that way you're not limiting because otherwise it'll go ahead and it'll return everything for you now where it says Filter by position ID, you'll use that little picker to select your job.

**[4:04] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[4:05] Speaker_00:** I didn't use that.

**[4:08] Speaker_00:** Maybe that's why.

**[4:09] Speaker_00:** I copied and pasted the job in there.

**[4:14] Speaker_02:** Yeah, because that one just wanted the actual ID number.

**[4:19] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[4:21] Speaker_02:** Because if you use filter by job title, you could have more than one job with that title.

**[4:27] Speaker_02:** So that may not be ideal.

**[4:28] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[4:32] Speaker_02:** And then where it says filter by job status.

**[4:35] Speaker_02:** You might need to clear out that field.

**[4:38] Speaker_02:** Otherwise, it's only, we default the available and internal.

**[4:43] Speaker_02:** That way, if you just want a date range for anything that's open, which is what a lot of people do, then you don't have to pick it.

**[4:49] Speaker_02:** So if you clear that out, it'll return within that date range all of the steps created for the pipeline for that position ID.

**[4:57] Speaker_02:** and what you probably want to do as well is where it says right below that filter by job status, it sounds like you're going to want to make sure the include current step only is unchecked.
