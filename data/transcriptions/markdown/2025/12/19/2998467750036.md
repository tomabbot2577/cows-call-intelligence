## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** This is Robin.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** It's Bob Leavitt with Brandon Becker.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Just got a quick question.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** Out of nowhere, I got a brain fart.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** I can't figure something out.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** I'm trying to open up a roll-up list and see the stages of the people, like who I made a second call to, who I didn't call yet.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** How do I do that?

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** I thought I just opened up the roll-up list.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** Yeah, you should have your stage column in the list.

**[0:27] Speaker_01:** Hold on.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** When I open up, I go to roll up, and I see a roll up list, and it has the names and the companies.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** I click the names, and then the names come up.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** But all I'm seeing is select the action column, the name of the company, the person's name, but I don't see anything for the stage.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** Unless you – did you change your layout possibly?

**[0:52] Speaker_01:** I don't know.

**[0:53] Speaker_01:** I don't know.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** I mean, I don't think so possibly.

**[0:56] Speaker_01:** If you go into, so once you're in a list, if you click configure within the menu at the top right.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** Wait a minute.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** So you're talking, is that the little round thing near my picture?

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** No, it would be within the roll-up menu.

**[1:18] Speaker_01:** So like where you would have, like if you were going to select names and link them to a position, send them a form letter, it may not be pinned.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** So you may need to go to the three-lined icon at the end of that toolbar.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** Okay, hold on a second.

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** So let me go.

**[1:32] Speaker_00:** I got here.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** I pull up the roll-up list, and then I got the three things.

**[1:36] Speaker_00:** And what would it be that I'd be looking for set stage?

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** No, it will be called configure in that menu.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** Yes, I see it, and it is checked.

**[1:54] Speaker_00:** Right, it's the gear wheel.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** Okay, so click that.

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** And then what do you have in your layout?

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** Because it will show you what's on the left.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** What's on the left is name, first name, last name, title, work phone, email, cell phone, city, last activity, stage and stage description, home email, blah, blah, blah.

**[2:21] Speaker_01:** So stage and stage description are where you see those stages.

**[2:25] Speaker_01:** So it sounds like they're going to be over at the right.

**[2:29] Speaker_01:** So if you close that window.

**[2:35] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:37] Speaker_01:** You said it was after last activity, I think you said, right?

**[2:40] Speaker_00:** I do see it.

**[2:41] Speaker_00:** I see it.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** Okay, I got you.

**[2:43] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[2:44] Speaker_00:** But it wasn't what I could physically see.

**[2:47] Speaker_00:** So is there a way I could just move it left or something?

**[2:50] Speaker_01:** Yeah.
