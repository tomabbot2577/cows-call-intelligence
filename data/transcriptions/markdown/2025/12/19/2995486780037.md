**[0:26] Speaker_04:** Good afternoon, this is Jim.

**[0:30] Speaker_03:** Hey, Jim.

**[0:30] Speaker_03:** Sandy Bishop.

**[0:31] Speaker_03:** How are you doing?

**[0:32] Speaker_04:** I'm well, Sandy.

**[0:33] Speaker_04:** How are you?

**[0:35] Speaker_03:** Good.

**[0:35] Speaker_03:** Good.

**[0:38] Speaker_03:** Hey, can you do me a favor?

**[0:40] Speaker_03:** Yeah, what's that?

**[0:40] Speaker_03:** Remind me what the focus of this version of PCR is about.

**[0:48] Speaker_04:** Sure.

**[0:48] Speaker_03:** I forgot.

**[0:50] Speaker_04:** Okay, yeah.

**[0:50] Speaker_04:** The PCRM, that's kind of the new product, the new version that we have of PCRecruiter.

**[0:57] Speaker_04:** And it is primarily a CRM package.

**[1:00] Speaker_04:** so it's going to include all of the same stuff you have, or rather right now most of the same stuff as PC Recruiter itself has, but it's also going to add CRM functionality.

**[1:11] Speaker_04:** So it's going to add a sales pipeline, and it's also going to add a simpler sequencing tool, all in a new UI, a new format of the system there.

**[1:24] Speaker_03:** So when you say sequencing tool, you're talking about a hiring process?

**[1:28] Speaker_03:** Yeah, yeah.

**[1:31] Speaker_04:** Well, yes.

**[1:31] Speaker_04:** So the sequencing within PC Recruiter, that's available now.

**[1:36] Speaker_04:** And I don't know if you have it.

**[1:37] Speaker_04:** Do you know if you have the premium package with the sequencing of PC Recruiter?

**[1:43] Speaker_03:** I think I do.

**[1:44] Speaker_03:** I'm able to post sendouts.

**[1:47] Speaker_03:** Is that what you're talking about?

**[1:49] Speaker_04:** Let me take a look.

**[1:50] Speaker_04:** Oh, no.

**[1:50] Speaker_04:** No, you don't have it, actually.

**[1:52] Speaker_04:** so the sequencing piece it's part of our premium package and what it does it is going to be like a drip campaigns piece so it's going to give you the capacity to mass communicate with people in an email you can set it up so that an email is sent out and then if they reply maybe a second email goes out or if they don't reply in a certain amount of days a different email would go out or maybe they're added to your call list or something like that it's really for mass communication and automated communication through calls, texts, SMS, and the like.

**[2:27] Speaker_03:** So that's what that'll do.

**[2:28] Speaker_03:** Got it.

**[2:28] Speaker_03:** Okay.

**[2:29] Speaker_03:** I'm with you.

**[2:30] Speaker_04:** So you don't have that.

**[2:31] Speaker_04:** You don't have that right now.

**[2:32] Speaker_04:** So that's something that would be new to you anyway.

**[2:34] Speaker_03:** No.

**[2:35] Speaker_03:** Between you and I, when that first came out, my reaction was it was kind of overkill.

**[2:42] Speaker_03:** My clients would go nuts if I started sending those amount of contact, those amount of emails or whatever.

**[2:51] Speaker_04:** Yeah.

**[2:52] Speaker_03:** A lot of people do feel that way.

**[2:54] Speaker_03:** Yeah.

**[2:57] Speaker_04:** Go ahead.
