## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** This is Robin.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Legendary Robin.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** How's life treating you?

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Oh, pretty good.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** I haven't talked to you in a bit.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Is my headset on low?

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** I'm going to turn it up.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** Yes, it's fine.

**[0:17] Speaker_00:** There you are.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** No, it could have been mine.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** I might have had it, like, moved down just a little bit.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** I do that sometimes.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** So, PCRAI, match-enabled thingy-majigger.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** How do I get it?

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** How do I set it up?

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** So there's really not much for you to do.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Like in that form on your PCR login page, like if you see where it is.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** It says here, how do I get it and put in my information?

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** I just finally found that as you answered the phone, by the way.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:46] Speaker_01:** Yeah, you fill that out.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** It makes a ticket.

**[0:49] Speaker_01:** And then what we have to do is we'll have you, then they'll have you, whoever gets assigned to, like go ahead and put in now so you get assigned to.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** I just sent it.

**[0:59] Speaker_01:** Okay, let me see.

**[1:00] Speaker_01:** I would have created a ticket for you.

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** I have to kind of organize it, streamline it.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** You guys got Tyler back.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** He left for a while there, and you got him back?

**[1:10] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[1:10] Speaker_00:** Good decision.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** Great guy.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** Oh, yes, absolutely.

**[1:15] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Tyler.

**[1:16] Speaker_01:** Yeah, he took another job, and I guess, I don't know, for a reason he didn't want the other one.

**[1:21] Speaker_01:** So glad it happened.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** Okay, so it assigned to Garrett.

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** So pretty soon Garrett will be reaching out.

**[1:29] Speaker_01:** to probably just like an email.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** What they have to do is they'll have you get to confirm which database name in case you have more than one or if you have more than one.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** And then basically we queue it up to have our server administrator re-index the database.

**[1:46] Speaker_01:** It needs to be re-indexed to support this.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Gotcha.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** And everybody on my team will have it when I get it.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** It's not a per users.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** It's just it has to be enabled by like per database.
