## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Hey, it's Tina.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** Hey, how's it going?

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** It's Tina.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** Good, good.

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** So just wanted to see if you talked to Jim and if I can just sign these papers.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** Jim hasn't been available today.

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** He's been in meetings, but he is aware I sent over an email.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** There would just be a process.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** He'd have to get in contact with David and have David sign something giving you permission so that in the future you would just be listed as a primary contact.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** Got it.

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, we will start that process as soon as Jim frees up today.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** But in the meantime, I did send an email to the J.
