**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hello?

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Hiya, Brittany?

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Yes, who is this?

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Hey, Jim.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** I'm sorry for my, who is this?

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** No worries.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** I always feel bad, but I just, by habit, I always go say the person's name first.

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** But yeah, it's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** Just calling to circle back.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** We got the signed agreement and the invoice was sent, but my team said they sent it again since it didn't look like it was open to anything.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** I just wanted to make sure you had that.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** Oh, yes, I do have it.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I would have already paid it, but I'm waiting for my business credit card to come so I can get points.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** And it was supposed to come yesterday.

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** So if it doesn't come today, I'll just use my business checking.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** But that's the only reason for the delay.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** No worries.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** I just want to make sure it didn't get lost or spammed or something like that sometimes it does but that is all very good um then I'll just wait to hear wait to see it paid and if there's anything else you need let me know okay um sounds good what for sure it'll be paid today it was on my list today as well to just reach out to you and like set up the training or do we have to wait until it's paid we have to have that conversation so they will wait till paid so once that comes in my team runs it then they let me know I put in the install ticket that takes usually like a day or so to get the database created once that happens that automatically then has a trainer assigned and then they let me know who it is and I can then get in touch to get you scheduled with that trainer we me and you and the trainer would have an initial kind of intro call and then on that first call the trainer will schedule your first two to three sessions before your dimensional search training.

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[1:43] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** Well, we'll be in touch soon then.
