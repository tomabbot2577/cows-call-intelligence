**[0:14] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:14] Speaker_00:** I got a question for you.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** I recently just made a transition to RingCentral, and I called you guys up because that little phone icon next to the phone numbers wasn't working.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** So they got that all squared away, And so that's working fine.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** But the text bubbled.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** I can't use a text part of it.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** So is there something else I need to do for the texting aspect?

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** Let me double check your setup for whatever username you're trying to use that with.

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** Are you in the J.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** And then I'll just log in as the admin user.

**[1:01] Speaker_01:** And which username is having the issue with texting so far?

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** J.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** Grayson.

**[1:07] Speaker_01:** Okay, got that.

**[1:09] Speaker_01:** Check the settings.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** Okay, so you do have the phone numbers filled out in the right place in the file.

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** So if you click on the, let's see, I'm going to try it on my end.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** Oh, yeah, I'm seeing that as well, where there is no texting button.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** Let me try something else.

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** I have the texting button.

**[1:33] Speaker_00:** I just, when I click it, nothing happens.

**[1:37] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[1:37] Speaker_00:** Like it doesn't open up the RingCentral box or anything like that.

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** Does it open up the, like, add activity window at all?

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** It does open up that activity window.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Oh, I see.

**[1:51] Speaker_01:** So at the top right of that, it'll list whatever phone numbers you have available.

**[1:57] Speaker_01:** You'll have to click on one of those phone numbers for the text pop up to appear.

**[2:03] Speaker_00:** Oh, so it's not just a single click that I just got to when I go into there.

**[2:08] Speaker_00:** I see.

**[2:08] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:09] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:09] Speaker_01:** And they don't make that too clear.
