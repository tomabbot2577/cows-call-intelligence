## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling MainSignature Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I spoke to Tyler earlier.

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** I've got an issue where our security feature in our Microsoft 365 puts an external little flag on resumes sent from anything outside of our system.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** And it triggers an error with the inhaler application?

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** I see.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:34] Speaker_01:** Let me see if Tyler is available.

**[0:36] Speaker_01:** One second.

**[0:38] Speaker_01:** Tyler.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** Let me check.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** One second.

**[0:43] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** It went to his voicemail.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** He might be, yeah, he might be on lunch actually right now.

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** Do you want me to send you maybe to his voicemail and then you can just leave a message.

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** He'll get back to you.

**[0:58] Speaker_00:** Well, he came online.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** He wasn't able to figure out the issue.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** He thought the issue was that we had these external tags, but it's just a standard Microsoft security feature.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** So inhaler should be able to work with this external tag.

**[1:12] Speaker_00:** So it looks like maybe some sort of change was made to the inhaler app recently, and it's breaking it with this Microsoft security feature.

**[1:25] Speaker_00:** So I need whoever handles inhaler as a developer probably needs to have a trouble ticket set up.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** I see what you mean.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** So it's, you're using, it's called a PCR outlook portal, right?

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** The, the add in for outlook classic.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** No.

**[1:41] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** So it's the inhaler.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** The inhaler application.

**[1:45] Speaker_01:** Oh, okay.

**[1:47] Speaker_01:** Resume inhaler.

**[1:51] Speaker_01:** Here, I'll create a ticket then.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** So, new ticket, Eric.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** And we'll say it's the resume inhaler.

**[2:04] Speaker_01:** It's not working with Microsoft security tags.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** Yeah, where it says an email came from an external source, there is a little flag that pops up that says...

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** I could do a screenshot and send you a couple of things just to show you.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** Okay, yeah.

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** Let me give you my direct email address and I can build that ticket and we can send it up to the developers.

**[2:35] Speaker_01:** Let me know when you're ready for the email.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** Let me do the screenshot.

**[2:50] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:53] Speaker_01:** Go ahead.
