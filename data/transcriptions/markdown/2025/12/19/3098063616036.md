**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Good afternoon.

**[0:02] Speaker_02:** This is Jim.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** Hey, Jim.

**[0:03] Speaker_01:** Noel Glaser calling.

**[0:05] Speaker_02:** Hey, Noel.

**[0:05] Speaker_02:** How are you?

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** I'm good.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** I'm good.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** How are you doing?

**[0:07] Speaker_02:** I am well.

**[0:08] Speaker_02:** I am well.

**[0:09] Speaker_02:** You didn't get my email.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** I did.

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** I did.

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** So I read that the second time after.

**[0:14] Speaker_01:** It made a little more sense.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** The first time.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** It's a little confusing the way it's written.

**[0:20] Speaker_02:** It is.

**[0:20] Speaker_02:** And I think normally when the contract is new, yes, it would be the setup in the first month.

**[0:25] Speaker_02:** when it's an upgrade or a move to PCRM, it's really that you do pay that 300, but that's going to be paid the next time your monthly goes.

**[0:33] Speaker_02:** It's not upfront.

**[0:34] Speaker_02:** So the only upfront is just the setup.

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[0:36] Speaker_02:** Right.

**[0:37] Speaker_02:** Right.

**[0:38] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:38] Speaker_01:** So then the invoice is 300 is what I'm seeing.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** It's just for the hours.

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** Yep.

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** All right.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** So where do I need to, let me go back to that.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** Let's see what the date was that you sent that.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** Last week.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** Was that Tuesday last week?

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** I think it was.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** I sent the bulk right on Tuesday.

**[1:09] Speaker_01:** It wasn't for a trade show I'm going to, so it's just lost in here.

**[1:13] Speaker_01:** It came.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** It was created.

**[1:14] Speaker_02:** Let's see what my date is on here.

**[1:16] Speaker_02:** The 17th.

**[1:17] Speaker_02:** So Wednesday, it looks like it was created.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** Wednesday and Wednesday.
