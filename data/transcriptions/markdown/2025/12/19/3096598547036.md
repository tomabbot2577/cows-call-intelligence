**[2:32] Speaker_01:** I'll just void this.

**[2:36] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'm good with that.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** I'm not super concerned about it.

**[2:41] Speaker_01:** We should probably put in a new cancellation ticket, though, since this one's so old.

**[2:47] Speaker_00:** I'll do this part.

**[2:48] Speaker_00:** Do you want to create the ticket and say, we do have history that you were wanting to cancel.

**[2:53] Speaker_00:** We voided your open invoice.

**[2:55] Speaker_00:** We're going to shut down your debit.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** Is there a email about it or when did they request it?

**[3:03] Speaker_00:** It's been kind of going back and forth, and we were trying to get Bill because we were saying, well, since you didn't formally tell us, because they left it like, oh, we want to just make sure our data transferred over.

**[3:13] Speaker_00:** Then they never did.

**[3:15] Speaker_00:** But there was also Jesse Fenton, too, at some point sometimes.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** So it's kind of been going on for a while.

**[3:21] Speaker_00:** Oh, I see.

**[3:22] Speaker_01:** I see what you're talking about.

**[3:23] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:24] Speaker_01:** let me take a look they need to cancel our account but they renewed you said there's a different like their renewal wasn't right now but yeah so if anything we got more than we probably should have I agree I agree because if those tickets are from a year ago the fact that we got the fact that we got May, June, and July payments actually in August we got more than I think we should have okay here's this so should this go it's not Ashley anymore is it or no it is Ashley is it was Jesse sent me okay And that email was a Carter at blah blah blah.

**[4:25] Speaker_01:** There we go.

**[4:27] Speaker_01:** Alright, so this is a ASP cancellation.

**[4:34] Speaker_01:** I don't care about that.

**[4:36] Speaker_01:** I don't care about any of that.

**[4:40] Speaker_01:** Yeah, Bill doesn't seem to make a priority.

**[4:45] Speaker_00:** I mean, we can only ask him so many times.

**[4:47] Speaker_00:** Like, I just didn't want to get in trouble with it, you know?

**[4:50] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[4:51] Speaker_01:** We need a better, like, system for it anyway.

**[4:53] Speaker_01:** What used to happen is when somebody requested a cancellation, Liz would send an email or whoever would send an email into the cancellation email group, which would go to all the owners, me, James, and Liz.
