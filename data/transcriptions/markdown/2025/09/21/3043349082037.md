## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Yes, this is Joachim. Hi, Robin. Hello, how are you? I'm fine, thank you. It's quite early in the States now, huh? A little after 8.30. I always start early. I have long days. I usually start earlier. We have to at 2.30 now. Yeah, I'm sorry about this, that the invoices were not paid, but my credit card is still the same. I didn't know that you changed, and we never received invoices. I always saw on the statement for the credit card that you have taken this $208, but we never received an invoice or things like that. So I have no idea where that email address came from. It was probably in there for years, which is why you probably never received any billing communication. I don't know where it came from. I never had this. Yeah. I didn't have this address. So what we did in the old system was kind of like it didn't offer auto pay, at least at one point, I guess, when it was started. Who knows? Maybe over time they did. So what it essentially did is it would send like a sales receipt and then just like process cards. so when we switch to the new billing system we just have way too many customers to be doing things so manual on something so with the new system um we're not doing any kind of sales receipt we're just sending invoices but you can sign up for auto pay you just have to put in your card details again um yeah yeah i can't transfer them to you okay yeah we couldn't transfer that over and so yeah different changes but it's definitely be a lot easier to manage a whole lot more automated stuff and reports and just to keep an eye on things closer okay so right so you put it on autopay again then yeah we could do it in autopay it's just instead of thinking of the sales receipt i don't know if you're familiar with quickbooks there was really just essentially we'd send a receipt and then try to process the card where we're doing everything with invoices now but you can sign up for autopay which is nice okay so all right so there's three of them that are currently open they're the ones that generated since the switch um so okay i don't have any late piece and they're good they took all those off if they were there okay so now your country this is where it gets a little tricky sometimes some places there was not a country option that we had to make sure it was added in okay so germany make sure that It's in there. Sure. And it is scrolling, scrolling. There we go. Okay. So what is the card number? It's 5584. Okay. 1002. Okay. 1100. Okay. 1533. And the expiration month and year? It's November 28. 11-28. And the security code? That's 383. Okay. And then the name of the card is your first name and last name, right? Right. Okay. Let me say add card. Okay, I want to try processing one of them. Actually, I don't want to do it that way because they asked me for all your details again. We'll do this where they process on the due date. Probably just something like a two. One second here. Because we have never been receiving anything. So I could print something. Let's see. Are you for users? For users, yes. Okay. For licenses, I guess. Okay, yeah. So if that ever changes, just let us know. We don't go by, like, what's in the database, because sometimes they're just API users or a test user or somebody you disabled. Can't really go by user count. So if that ever changes, just let us know, and we just adjust the billing for your next use case. Yeah, yeah, sure. Okay. Will you pay the three open invoices now, or shall I do that? I'm going to try to do that for you here. Let me just make sure they're going through. I think they did. Okay, so now that we have the right address for you, you should be getting receipts for those. and you'll get notices like, I don't know, for some reason maybe the card expired and it doesn't process. They'll remind you that your invoice is open. You can also, if you have any desire to, in that email that I sent you, there's a link to our customer billing portal. It doesn't use anything with PCR credentials. Again, security. Then if you could go in there with this email address that we're using now, for you and you could click sign up and create a billing account so that way if you ever want to go in and see your invoices or um you know maybe you want to change the card there's like a vault area once you're in that site that you can go and like change your card details okay but for now you are all set all the new system and it's all good um and then i think it was michael from your office The Zing issue has been fixed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We talked today, and he's using it since this morning, and I've done the same. So it's great that it works again. Yeah. These sites, when they start making changes, because it's not an integration, it affects us, our ability to read it. And so we kind of go in and one way for a developer to be available from a different project but then figure out what they changed to make it work again. Yeah, but it works now...
