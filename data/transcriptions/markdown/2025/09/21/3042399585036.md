You are the first participant. Please stand by. What a good idea. Hello. Hello, Caitlin. How are you? Good. How about you? I'm all right. Do you hear me all right? Yeah, I'm good. Excellent, excellent. And I don't recall, is there anyone else joining us, or is it just you and I on the call today? Michelle's joining us. Looks like she's just coming in now. Awesome, awesome. Hello. Hello, Michelle. How are you doing? I'm all right. I'm all right. I also wanted to kind of show you around PC Recruiter. If background noise gets to be too loud, let me know. I work from home and there's about 30 kids on a water bounce house in my front yard. So there's a little bit of screaming going on out there. So let me know if it gets too distracting. Party at your house. Yeah, we do just kind of before school starts a couple weeks, we do a random weekday summer party. It started during COVID and it caught on. So people just come and go all day. And we have one of those big like water bounce house slides and food and all kinds of stuff going on. So there's a whole mess of people out there. But I'm in here doing a little bit of work. I've been off and on all day, so happy to show you around the system here a little bit. So I wanted to start out and just find out a little bit more about what you're looking for in a software package. What are your main criteria, requirements, or what do you use right now? Michelle, I can go if you want. Me too. Yeah, sure. Yes. Right now we are using StaffTrack, which I believe you guys have an integration with of some kind, we've heard. We use them as kind of our full-fledged system right from posting our job postings to reviewing candidates to attaching them to job orders to seeing their hours and processing the payroll. we're really just looking for a system that's a little bit more modern you know a staff track unfortunately doesn't have very much technology in terms of automation or AI or anything like that so we were kind of just hoping to see PC Recruiter I believe if I'm not mistaken you may also have like a time and attendance, possibly a scheduling piece to your system? If I believe I saw the right thing, if so, that's something that we're also interested in. Okay. We have a little of that. So around PC Recruiter, we do have a timesheets module. So you can have people, if you have contractors, they can clock in. There is a, excuse me, there's an app that they can download, and then they can clock in and out and those are hours are fed into PC Recruiter and then they're pushed out to QuickBooks from there. So that's kind of what that will do. Not really individual schedules per se, but we can track hours and stuff like that. Okay. Okay. Yeah, we are going to be a full ATS and CRM. We're going to have the ability to track companies, candidates, interviews, positions. you can post jobs share jobs search the database group candidates push them on roll-up lists and then using those roll-up lists you have the capacity to send out email campaigns sequences we have a drip campaign sequencing piece as well we do also have an AI suite so you can go ahead and set it up to kind of work with there's some content generators there's an AI search there's even a nice auto-match feature where it'll pull the closest, I think, 15 to 20 matches to a job in your system. So that'll work real well, which is kind of cool. So a lot of nice things in there. Were you looking to replace your staff track or supplement it? I've not heard of any integration that we wrote with them. That's not to say it doesn't exist, because a lot of times the way our API works, the softwares can actually write integrations without us even knowing, and that does happen. so that could have been okay uh yeah it's very possible they had given your company as one that they had maybe integrated with in the past i'm not sure to what extent and i'm sure it would be sort of custom for us as well um but yeah i guess it really depends on what your system offers but yeah we are looking at a potential either replacement of staff track or if there is an integration possibility with some pieces of yours some pieces with theirs or theirs for payroll like we're very open to what's possible at this point. Okay, sure, sure. And with our open API, it makes it easy to write a custom integration. And sometimes, like, they might write an integration or something like that. So maybe they've done it before. So that could be the case that is happening. So, yeah, so let me kind of show you around what we've got. We have a couple of different interfaces, actually. So we have PC Recruiter Classic, which is kind of our base package. It's been around quite a while. It's going to allow for tracking. it's going to allow for pretty much the full gamut of ATS. We do also have a CRM prod...
