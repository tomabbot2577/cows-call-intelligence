## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, what's up, Tyler? Hey, Garrett. Hey, I was just on with Scott Shapiro. They only have one default company, bud. Yeah, I sent them an email the day after that. I said, sorry, that was intended for a different customer I trained today. Oh, okay. That was a mistake email. Gotcha. Yeah, so they should be in good shape. Okay. Well, I helped them clean it up regardless. They had not the right company as a default company. Oh, okay. Well, good. Then at least something good came out of the mistake email. But, all right, I'll give them a call back real quick. All right. Sounds good. Thanks, man. All right. Bye. Bye....
