 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. You have not entered any numbers. Please... Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. This is Sabina. Hello, Sabina. How are you? Good. How are you? I am well. I am well. Thank you for joining me today. I want to show you around PCRecruiter a little bit. I wanted to start by just learning a little bit more about what you're using now and what you're looking for in a software package, be it ours or anyone's. What are your main criteria, your main functionality requirements? Sounds good. Do you want to leave video off or should we put video on? I'm going to share my screen and actually kind of click through here so I don't ever usually keep video on. So video off is fine if that's cool with you. Okay. Fine with me. Fine with me. Yes. Oh, yeah. I have a dog in my feet. So where are you then? Okay. Sounds good. Well, yes. So I am new to Next Level Partners as Vice President of Executive Search. And one of the first things that's on my docket is to implement, select and implement a recruitment CRM system. And so I've met with the team and gathered what's worked, what hasn't worked. We don't have an actual CRM, which is shocking to me, but we're using primarily all the functionalities in LinkedIn Recruiter really for the last decade or so. So they had an attempt at a CRM, but it was a really small team of two at the time. There are six of us now, and it was just more than they could manage the upkeep on and just didn't really stick with the resources at the time. But we've gotten to a critical point where it's really going to be required, especially as we want to continue to build business. We're currently doing our business development and spreadsheets and along with the consulting practice. So we do have a larger consulting practice. That's the bulk of our business that does continuous improvement consulting. And that's where most of our business comes from is from those clients. But we want to span out and really scale it up in the next couple of years. So that's why we're looking. And ideally, we're looking for a platform that is designed for a boutique executive search firm that is simple to use, easy to collaborate, really gives us better contact sourcing and improved lead times for our clients, better relationships with our candidates, and then also allows us to be able to really drill down and understand and report on our performance as far as, you know, time to fill successful candidates and really capture some of those metrics. Because we are with LinkedIn, and that's primarily where we're, what we're utilizing for most of our sourcing, it'll be important and critical, really, that it integrates seamlessly with that. So, we're looking at systems that, you know, that have those capabilities. Some of the nice-to-haves would be maybe sequencing, but we, you know, we're okay with really as long as we can put the individuals in groups and things like that and do group outreach, we can still do that in a manual process as well if needed. But, you know, really looking to a firm that's able to support us and get us to that next level. And I think that's kind of the thumbnail sketch of what we're looking for. I do have a little list as we went through the requirements with the team. We just kind of brainstormed. I'm finding that a lot of them are, you know, really just standard features, but I'll pop those in the chat so you can kind of see what some of the team brainstormed on, what we'd like to see. That's kind of a laundry list of some of the things that we're looking for. We are not looking for an applicant tracking type of system that manages massive job postings and things like that. So it's much more lower volume, transactional, and quality over quantity. Perfect. Okay, that's good to know. And are you looking to have the jobs posted even just to your website at all or not at all? Yes, that is something that we may potentially move to as well is really having that would be a nice integrative to integrate with our website so that we could put them on there and to, you know, showcase what we're working on more than really hoping to capture, you know, qualified applicants. I think it's more of a marketing tool, but it also will help us develop our bench strength of strong practitioners and lean. That's really our niche focus for many of our searches. Okay, very well. Awesome. That gives me a good idea of what you needed to do there. So let me show you around a little bit, and I'm just going to kind of give you my general walkthrough, concentrating on those areas that you were mentioning. and then if you have any questions as we go, feel free to jump right in as we go through here. Sounds good. Thanks, Jim. Okay, so we're going to be looking. We're right now looking at the sign-in screen. Do you see my screen okay? Yes, no problems. I mi...
