## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good morning, this is Jim. Hey, Jim, this is Stuart Hamblin over at Responsive Deployment. You and I were just messaging on your customer support line. Yeah, I was just about to pop you a quick email, but yeah, how can I help? Well, I've used you guys before, and I liked it a lot. I especially liked how well your service integrated with, oh my goodness, the calling app. Anyway, yeah, RingCentral. There we go. Oh, my goodness. And I had it just written down right in front of me here. Anyway, but I especially liked how well it integrated between the two of them. And I'm requesting both of those. But I have to get like some sort of quote today in order to get it onto the request for like the wish list for the budget. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I could certainly do that. So how many users would you have? Do you know what package you'd be looking at? I can kind of help with that. How many users do you think you'd be? Well, there's only a few recruiters here. We're probably looking at six or eight seats, so not a huge one to start off with anyway. So if you were looking at the premium package, and I can write this up in an email if you need it in writing, premium package is going to be about $115 per user per month, and that's going to include everything we have. That would also include the email campaigns, the sequencing, the reporting tools, and everything there. And then a one-time fee of $9.50 set up. That would include 12 hours training, and that would just be one time for the office. And then do you have any data to convert? I think you said you weren't using anything, so there's not a proper ATS in place to convert. Right, yeah, there's not. We're using SharePoint, which kind of made me laugh when I took this job. I'm like, really? So there's that. You said that was the premium package. Is there sort of a basic package? Because they're going to ask me for that. Oh, yeah. So I can include both. So the basic package is going to leave off the automated sequencing, email campaigns, and analytics reporting. It's going to be $95 per user per month. And it's going to be $750 set up with 10 hours training. So a little bit less training a little bit cheaper a little bit less software What I'll do I'll email both price points both packages And I even have an attachment that outlines kind of the bullet pointed features of what's included in each Okay All right sounds good Okay And yeah if you do ever need a demo if it gets to that point Additional questions anything else I can help with that So I have all my contact information there and I can help you with anything. Is this some kind of budgeting for next year and not anything you're buying right away? In two or three months is when our budget is going to reset, so not too far away. But no, I don't think I need a whole lot of training. I just spent the last five years using your product, so I shouldn't need a whole lot of refresher. Perfect. And if you wanted to start with just a couple of users and then kind of slowly add users as you grew, you could do that too. So we're very flexible to add and drop users. Is there any pricing difference in that? No, no. You would just start off like at one user at 115, and then each additional user is an additional 115. But some people like to start out slower initially, get some experts trained in the system, or sometimes you just might find you grow or you need additional people at the organization using the system. Okay, all right. We're scalable. Awesome. Thank you so much. That was much quicker and easier than I thought it would be. Yeah, Stuart, I'll get that over to you in a little bit. I'll email over kind of both price points and all the details there, and then you'll have my contact info should there be any additional questions. Or if you want to set up a demo or anything like that, I'm happy to help. Sounds good. I appreciate you. Thank you. Very well. All right. Thank you very much, sir. We'll get that over to you soon. Yes, sir. Bye. Bye-bye....
