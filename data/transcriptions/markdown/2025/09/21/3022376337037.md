## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Your call has been forwarded to the voicemail for Ryan Bennett. No one is available to take your call. At the tone, please record your message. When you finish recording, you may hang up or press the pound key for more options. Hey, Ryan. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just circling back with you. Do check in and see how everything was going with PC Recruiter. I got a notification that it's been, I think, 30 days since any activity on your training ticket, so I wanted to make sure there wasn't anything more that you needed. I know you added some users last month, too. I wanted to make sure they were all going well and had the training that they needed. Please give me a call. Let me know how your experience with PC Recruiter is going and if there's any more training that you need. I'm happy to get you in touch with Robin. 440-856-0314 is my number. Once again, Jim with PC Recruiter calling to check in 440-856-0314. Thank you....
