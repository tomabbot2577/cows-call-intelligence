 okay so oh the Ben Williams probitis or probitis oh yeah they're doing the rename and all of that I want to reign them in though because this is somebody I just want to give you a little backstory sure this is somebody that it took jim wise two months to schedule his consulting call because the guy just you know he doesn't reply you know things like that one of those all of a sudden i want to do everything kind of exactly now he was given 16 hours and used three of them and they're expired and he's like oh i didn't know they expired yeah and then garrett said well that's in the recap and you get this and that, you know, you get all these alerts now automatically. Plus it's at the bottom of the recap, but he's also been suspended twice for non-payment. Okay. So it's just for a little while, like I'm not even following up the schedule because you need to pay. I'm trying to get you to pay. He would like, and like, now he's going to be like, oh, I need this, this, this. But when me and Patsy were chasing him down for payment, missing in action. That's good to know. Yeah. It took him a while to get back to me too. So yeah, I'll just know that he's not a big rush. He is. So don't do anything extra other than job board. Yeah. He went to Jim Lombardo. I don't, I didn't know about all this and kind of, you know, what? So we don't want to do anything extra. What we're going to do, Nick's going to do is tell him, we'll give you half the hours. We're not giving you 13 hours because you failed to follow up. Right. Okay. I even think seven is too much to give them. Yeah. Because it's on you. Yeah. You were asked, are you ready to schedule? You were asked to pay your bill. I would say no. My vote was no. Yeah. They can buy training. Yeah. That's fine. Yeah. I mean, because on my side, basically all I was doing was just waiting for them to be done renaming the account and then I was going to give him, you know, just kind of throw the setup together because he, I think he filled out the consulting form and everything. I just don't have anything to put up for him yet. But I felt like there's a little comment about timesheets. Don't do anything. Oh no. All I was talking about timesheets is I was just going to give him the short code for it because he said he was going to use it. I'm like, okay, well I can give you the code that you would need for it. Yeah. So now he's like, oh, I need all my users set up on email, which he just went from five to three so who are these three people that don't have email yet right you know what i mean there's a lot of questionable shit like is he just dropping to three i think i checked their database like i want to make sure we're going to give him some of his hours back okay but not but not all that he didn't use yeah um but i don't want us doing anything unless it's tracked like against time obviously job board we don't count that so that's one thing but if you start saying oh what about doing this for me what about doing that for me say like just tag me in the text kiss my ass yeah yeah um because we're also we're gonna we're gonna i guess nick's gonna create a ticket and he's gonna write in the ticket that the time that we let it has to be scheduled it has to be committed to like we're not going to let this go on and we're going to cap it off it like you'll get six or seven hours whatever it's going to be You have to use them within two months, and your bills have to be current. You're like, we're putting some rolls down because – Yeah. We suspended or threatened to suspend them twice. I think one time we definitely did. Oh, okay. That's good to know. And then he was mad because he went into the biller's gene. He had like five invoices, and I'm like, you're suspending. You're getting suspended. Yeah. I mean, I was nicer about it. Yeah. And he's like, well, I need to have this. I'm like, you need to pay at least two today. Yeah. It was already like, you got to pay by this Friday. And it was after the Friday. He's like, I really need this on. And, you know, are you going to suspend me? I'm like, yeah, I'm going to. Unless you pay two, you got to pay at least two today. Well, when he went in, it paid four of the five. And because he, I don't know, whatever happened. So then he was mad. And it's like, what do you have to do? Oh, it's the money. Anyway, and then it locked his card because the last one got declined or something like that. So he was mad. it's like well you owe the money anyway you know oh boy i'm gonna mess today's like you're locked you know you're the charges locked my card it's like that's what's you and your bank i don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you about that one but you owe us for five months right now right oh boy yeah so that's the kind That's a story. So I just want to – in case he tries to push for more. We want using time and once that time is over and once in two months, billable.
