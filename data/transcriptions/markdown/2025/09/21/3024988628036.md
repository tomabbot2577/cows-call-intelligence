## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi Mackenzie, this is Nancy with Aviation Personnel. How are you? Hi, I'm doing well Nancy. How are you? Good. I have a created report that I use. Let me see what it's called. Recruiter Monthly Report. By the way, this is Nancy with Aviation Personnel. The report works perfect for me, but I need to be able to for it to show what clients on that list and be able to use an Excel spreadsheet with that like to export it or download it or whatever you want to call it. It doesn't have that info. Can you repeat the last part I was typing everything you said and the report needs to show what client so right now it just shows the number of submittals and I can click on it but what I want it to show it on the actual report okay that helps me let me catch up to you though I'm going to log I'm going to pull you up in our in our database and then go into your So basically I want it to show the recruiters name, the client, and the position that they're being submitted to. Okay What's the username you log in with, Nancy, if you don't mind? you Thank you. All right. How do you get to this report? You give me the name, created report, recruiter monthly report. Is it under reports? Mm-hmm. Name, position. What section of the reports? OIC, it's under auditing reports, custom user metric report. Okay, I just want to see an example. I want to see exactly what you are referring to. I need this one just for it to stay like this one because I use this one for a different thing. So if we want to create a new one, those are the three things that I need is a recruiter name, client name, and position. Okay, one second. Okay, would like this one to stay the same. So you need, do you need another one that includes those three and all of the same information as well? Mm-hmm. Okay, so need another one created that includes all the same information as this report, which is a custom user metric report. And it is called Recruiter Monthly Report. As well as the three mentioned fields, which is Recruiter's Name, the Client, and Position they are submitted to. Or being submitted to. Alright, so I'm just now looking at the report for the first time. Recruiter Monthly. Okay, so there's like a bunch of clickable links. I can probably look at the configuration of it. I guess let me make sure I understand what you mean by recruiter's name, client, and position they're being submitted to, and see if that's possible to add to the report. I haven't been around the custom user metric reports in quite a while. Let me take a gander at the configuration here. I know you go in here, you go into the tab for manage user metric reports. I'm going to look at it. I won't change anything. I just want to look at how the current one you have is set up. Okay, it's this one. Okay, that'd be really easy to recreate. That wouldn't take very long to recreate this. That's good. I guess I would have to go into each one of these select and edit sources. and like note which ones are selected that's that's not so bad but there's only what one five columns okay so let's see if we can get the recruiter's name to be added i um did you make this report or did you have a pcr employee help you do it yeah i think they did and I've had it for a while. Okay. When you say recruiter's name, do you mean like the PCR username? Let me see what it's called. Let me see what it's called. Yeah, username. Okay. Okay, so the recruiters names like the person inside PCR, the person using PCR, and the client would be like a name record right like the name on a name record that's being submitted and then a position. Okay. Position is position. Position. All right, let's see if we can pull this up with this type of There is a positions checkbox. Transaction entities, placements, activities. I don't know if this type of report will be able to pull up the name record. Yeah, because I think the spirit of a user metric report is kind of you're like trying to run a report on the users inside PCR themselves, not like the records. So this might have to be like a different type of report that gives similar information that's interesting though because it might not be output in the same format where you have these like clickable numbers on the you do you use the do you use the print uh print out where it shows like it'll show like the username and then it'll say like 18 submittals and you can like click the number 18 see i'm wanting instead of clicking on it i need it to come out and say who it was with instead of me clicking up I want to print it or send it as a file okay so that okay so then for that you actually wouldn't want the clickable links right because it would just have to already be all displayed right so then this definitely yeah this definitely has to be a different type of report okay so then this recreating this would be actually a little bit more in-depth then because I'd have to recreate all these differ...
