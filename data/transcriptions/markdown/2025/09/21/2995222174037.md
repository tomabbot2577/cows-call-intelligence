## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm well, thank you. I'm calling about an invoice that I've been receiving that is an error. I keep getting invoices saying that I owe a bill to Main Sequence, and I don't even have an account with you. Okay. What is your name? My name is Charles Broome and the company is Wireless Group. I have an invoice number if you need that too. Yeah, that would actually be really helpful. What's the invoice number? 2202304. 220, I'm sorry, say that again. Had a little fumble finger there for a moment. Yes, 220-2304. Okay. Oh, that's why I spelled it wrong. Okay. Rylas Grove. Let's see. What's going on here? That's on top of your head. Yeah, let's see. And are you with Rylas Grove? I'm the president of Rhymes Group. Okay. Were you a PCR customer before? A long time ago. It's been several years. Okay. And... I think this was created... Let me look over here. Brian Lester. Okay, let me look at the company name. He switched billing systems and I wonder. That should not have been generated.
