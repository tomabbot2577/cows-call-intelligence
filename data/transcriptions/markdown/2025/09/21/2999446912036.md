## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSecret Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hey, McKenzie. This is Gus Cawley with Staff Financial. I built a profile, and I'm testing it, but I don't see any applications firing away. So can you log into my app and look at it for me, with me? Oh, you need somebody to apply? Yeah, I mean, okay, hold on. Let me understand better. Let me pull you up Log into my app Log into my app Yeah Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Yep Staff Financial Username is Gus Sure Do you happen to be a self-hosted database? No No No Could be under Law Staff North Point Search Group Staff Financial Group Law Staff Group Mm-hmm gotcha okay yep yeah you're under a couple different names or sorry yeah take out lost a couple different companies yeah lost f I lost the domain on that so I won't get any emails there yeah let me see what for the Gus Colley at Law Staff Group, the... Yeah, that won't work. Email address is gus at stafffinancial.com. Yes, perfect, yeah. That's good, okay. Thank you. Yeah, that's the big thing. Email is the biggest thing. All right, so I'm logged into your database as Gus. Okay, thank you. If you go to, like, any random user, like, say, Andre Frost right there in the names, click on the name tag. Sure, sure. Click the clipboard with pencil and we're going to select the profile which is FP. So it's the FP&A director application. Director application, okay. I'm looking at it. When I submit this, I'm not getting the profile. So if I go to the profile setup for FP and hit edit, automations, it should be going to all its staff financial. Gus at hiringguide.net. so director application edit automations i'm expanding all the sections here who to notify all at stafffinancial.com notify sender username are you supposed to select a form letter well i got a form letter written it's the most recent one in there and I got it going out right now, but when I filled it out to test it, it normally would email us. I'm just wondering if it's working. All right, let's check the database's outgoing mail settings, make sure those are good. okay it seems like those would be fine so um when anybody fills this out are you um does it send it if you fill it out internally or is it only when you actually like send it through like an external... Does it typically... Well, it should. It normally does. It normally does. Okay. Sorry, I'm like asking questions as if I don't know because I'm not really too sure. But like normally, do you have to pick a form letter and then it attaches the profile as an attachment to the form letter? Because I don't see a form letter attached. The form letter, if you go... Yeah, if you go to the form letters, it's the most recent letter. I tell you what, I'm going to... But I don't see that form letter selected in the settings of the profile under automations. You wouldn't need to. You wouldn't need to, okay. So, you don't have a lot of experience with this, do you? I'm just trying to understand like how you expect to see like how do you expect to see the form letter if it's not selected there um is there another automation that is I'm not looking for the form letter I'm just I take I write a letter I stick a link to this profile in it And then I send it to my candidates. So I send a letter to myself, and I just click the clipboard with a pencil to fill out that form. And it's – the form's not coming through. So here, I'll add you to my database. what's your name Mackenzie um less okay email address it's m and then my last name is s-c-a l-i-s-e mscalise at main sequence dot net okay here we go okay so I'm going to email you this form letter okay email okay okay let me know when you get it job alert director of FP and a hybrid role is teeny back in healthcare leader okay I did click the link and click the line out here yes sir Okay. Okay. I'm just going to click the first option. Test, test, test, test. Perfect. Yeah. PCR test. First option. PCR test. PCR test. First option. The most intriguing application ever. All right. Submitting it. Thank you. Looks great. Okay. And then you're expecting to get an automated email sent to you with that profile attached? Hold on. I got it. I got it. It worked. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Mackenzie. Thank you. Thank you. I didn't do anything. I got peace of mind now. That's all that matters. Yeah. Another great way for me to test automated emails or whatever things of that nature is a lot of people go to, when they're troubleshooting, they go to the inbox of the person that was supposed to receive it. And I actually always tend to go to the sent folder of the email that was supposed to send it. That's a good way to, if you're, I don't know, if you're wondering if something is sending. Sometimes it is sending, but the person's not receiving it. And if you go to the sent folder of the sending, you'll know the answer to that question sooner. So that's another thing. But yeah, I'm glad it's like working. Yeah, it looked like it was...
