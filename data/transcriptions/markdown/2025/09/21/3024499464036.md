## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, my name is Lynn Freeman. I'm with Freeman Enterprises. And several weeks ago, I had to change a password on my email account. I called PC Recruiter, and they helped me update it. I thought I would never need to call back, so I didn't write down the instructions, and something came up with my email provider again that required that I reset the password again. and so I'm getting an error message that it cannot connect to the outgoing mail server. And I followed the instructions that I thought I knew to go to the system, the email setup, and the email aliases, but when I changed it to the new email password, it's still not working. So obviously it's my error, so help me please. Yeah, no worries. I can take a look. So I just logged into your database now. Username LWF, is that correct? Correct. Okay. Let me take a look here. All right, so email alias, let me test connection. Okay. I went through the steps to change it, but you can't, it only shows the dots. You can't actually, it doesn't let you have a look-see to make sure that you've typed it in correctly. So I just did a cut and paste to try to do it, but again, it does, so I'm assuming that it accepted the change that I made, but maybe there's something I'm supposed to do that didn't happen. I don't know. I'm just trying to figure out where my misstep is. I'm getting that error when I test the connections. Let me look over some of this here. Okay. Let me go to servers. Okay, it looks like there's two mail servers. I think the one on the top is throwing an error. Let me check the one on the bottom here. Why would I have two mail servers? I'm not sure. You might have added an additional one. I changed over from one company to another, and so maybe I was supposed to change that settings in two places and only changed it in one. It was working fine after I made the change for several weeks. And then when I made the change again, it worked for maybe a week. And then I started to get an error message. It was like a delay that it didn't recognize that I changed it. So I thought, oh, gosh, maybe I won't have to change it in PCR. But no, it caught up with me. Who is your email provider? Hostway. It used to be HostMySite, which they're the same group of companies, but it shifted over to HostWay, H-O-S-T-W-A-Y. Okay. Let me take a look there. Okay. I'm going to just look up, make sure everything's configured correctly for HostWay. Doing a quick little search. Okay, so we're doing an FL. Let's see. 5, 8, 7. Okay. I found on a HostWave website that their outgoing SMTP server is named smtp.siteprotect.com. And let me see, yours is listed as smtp01.myexchangeemail.com. Did they give you – or where did you find the SMTP server information that you inputted? Was that something that they sent to you? You know what? That has been there forever, or either they just talked it through while I was on the telephone with them. But it seems like when I changed it last time, it was under email setup and outgoing. Okay. Oh, yeah, let me take a look there. So that's going to be the email setup outgoing mail settings. That's going to be your overall database email rather than one connected to your username particularly. so outgoing mail settings will be able to send general notification emails that the database needs to send out like a password reset email something like that so I'll test that connection and we'll look at the settings if that one connects we can kind of copy those settings over let's see to your to your username oh okay that one failed too there let me try I'm going to add a additional mail server here and I'm going to try putting in the host way suggested SNTP server settings and see if that works here so we got the port this five seven okay and I'm just going to copy Now, my stuff will continue to track in and out of Outlook into activities once we've done this right. There's nothing else we'll need to do to correct that. Right. So if you do have the Outlook portal installed, okay, if that's up and running, so your activities are being tracked through that, so that's in good shape, the incoming and outgoing mail activities. It's just that you won't be able to email out from PCR itself without this email alias connection we're trying to make here. Okay. So I will try to get that fixed for you today. Okay. Thank goodness for IT gurus like you, Garrett. Thank you. This makes me want to crawl up in the fetal position. No worries. Yeah. Hopefully we can fix it. But if not, there are people way smarter than me on my team that can actually help as well. So we'll find a solution either way. Okay. Okay. So do me a favor and go to system in the main menu at the top of PCR. Okay. Then go to email setup on the left. Okay. And email alias list on the right. In the bottom frame I just started creating one called new email alias. Go ahead and hit the pencil on that. All right. That'll edit...
