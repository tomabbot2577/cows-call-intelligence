## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by password. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and start the recording. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry. you Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yes, Tuch. okay well I'm on the phone so I can't wipe okay it could be an hour you can do it good morning Blake how are you Hey, how are you? I'm well. Are you a robot? I am not a robot. Oh, I can't see you. Oh, you know what? My camera's off. Let me hop that on there. That's okay. I didn't know if you wanted to do video or not. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I think it was off by default because it's something I was doing the other day. But I am not a robot. Just messing around. Oh, no. A lot of times people are shocked. We have a chat for support on our website, and we'll chat people back, and they're like, wait, you're a human? We're like, yeah. That's awesome. Because it starts out with the AI chat, but then it dumps it to one of us, so then it switches over, and it's actually a live person texting. It surprises people sometimes. Yeah, yeah. Very well. Well, glad you could join me today. Yeah. I tried to dial in. Yeah, sorry about all the back and forth, but I can do another 30 minutes here. They moved it to 10, and then I got an 11. And if we have to go over, happy to reset, but let's kick it off. Kind of show me what you're working with. For sure, for sure. So I wanted to learn a little bit about what you're using now, what you're looking for in a software package, kind of main elements, main features that you really need to have. Sure. um honestly the reason i reached out was we just hired a gentleman uh his name's nick and maybe i probably could have had him on the call but um he he's in my office so he can kind of hear our chat but he said at his old firm they used pc recruiter and he thought it was pretty beneficial for his business i've never used it i've never really needed it um so i'm more or less kind of wanting to review. I want to see it myself and then probably be able to answer that question better for you after I see it. But he liked the tracking part. And what else? Tags were really helpful. Tags, tracking, imports. Just the node system. Sounds like overall, he just liked having PC recruiter for his old company. And just to give you a little knowledge in us, We are a five-person company founded about 20 months ago, doing some good things. We brought on Nick to start our construction vertical. We, for, I guess, technology purposes, full transparency, I am developing an ATS on the back end. It's just not ready, and it's nowhere near what PC Recruiter is going to be. Right now, we're manually tracking everything in a spreadsheet. That's how we've lived. Obviously, that's not going to sustain as we grow. We use Aviante Bold for our temporary staffing business unit. That's a whole nother division that is 50x the size of our direct hire division right now. We live in Bold for invoicing, but we do not put our candidates or anything in there besides the client. And then when we place the candidate, the applicant tracking system, we are developing on the back end, the interface. I'm probably giving you too much, but this is good for you to know as you kind of look into what pricing or what this might look like. But the interface doesn't, it doesn't, the company we work with, they're doing it for temp staffing. They'd have to create a whole new interface for direct hire. So I'm living in it as if it were temp, but not using some of the stuff. and that is nowhere near where it needs to be for the next couple years so that's a long-term does that answer your question i know that's kind of a lot but no that does certainly absolutely so yeah so let me show you on pc recruiter some of the various features functions kind of what we do and how we work i'm going to share my screen here to get us into a sign-in you should be momentarily looking at my sign-in screen right here Okay, there we are. Do you see that all right? Yes, sir. Perfect, perfect. So we are all cloud-based, so it's going to be something that will run on a PC or a Mac. So no matter what type of machine you have, you're going to be able to run it. There's a mobile app that's going to run on pretty much any browser as well. So real flexible on how this is going to be set up. Getting myself logged in, I'm going to be able to log into the system. Each user would have their own unique password. So you'll be able to see who sent the email, recorded the note, scheduled the follow-up, talked to the candidate, whatever it might be. Everything's tagged back to their username. So that's going to make it really simple for reporting and tracking and everything of that nature. Now, once you're in, the main menu bar at the top is going to be your primary navigation. And that's going to be where you'd go to get to your three primary record types...
