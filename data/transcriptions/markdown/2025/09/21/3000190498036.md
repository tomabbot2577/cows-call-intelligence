## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello. Hi, is this Stacy? I'm looking for Stacy. My name's Mackenzie. I'm with PC Recruiter. Hi, Mackenzie. Hi, Stacy. I was told to call you and make sure you're all good. And I don't know what that means. And I'm kind of scared a little bit. And you have my full attention for as long as you need me until you're all good. So what's up? Okay. All right, Mackenzie. So just so you know, I probably did raise a red flag. I reached out to Bill last night because I was like, hey, I called four times on Friday. No answer. Called three times yesterday afternoon. No answer. I'm not leaving a message. I just have general questions. And I reached out to Bill and I said, hey, Bill, you know, like, you know, I don't want to bog down Nick with general questions. I don't. You know what I mean? Like, he's got a bunch of stuff going on. You know, we hit him with new PCRM stuff. You know what I mean? These were general questions like, hey, why isn't my Zoom working on this? You know what I mean? Like, hey, why isn't this, you know, we just had general questions and it was just very frustrating. And I asked Bill, I said, hey, is there somebody else that I can have a direct number for? Like, hey, it's a quick question. Like, it doesn't take a ticket. It doesn't do this. It doesn't do that. Just so you know where that all came from. You know what I mean? Oh, it's fine. I mean, it's chaotic around here lately, but we're trying to right the ship and get back on track. Right, and I get that. Right, and I understand. You know, like some people are on vacation, but, you know, it's still got to operate. It's still got to run. You know what I mean? So, you know, I finally did get a hold of – yesterday morning I did get a hold of somebody, and apparently I need an enterprise API in order to get the Zoom thing to work, and that's on Zoom Zen. And so I've reached out to like six people in Zoom. We signed up for Zoom per year. You guys telling us too, because we wanted that data enrichment. You know what I mean? We wanted to find a way like, how do I get ahold of these candidates? You know what I mean? And now we're trying to integrate, you know, like how I'm going to integrate PCR with Zoom. Okay. And I did create yesterday two things in name records. Like one says Zoom email and one says Zoom phone number. Right. And then now I got a custom field. Yeah, I created the custom field yesterday. Okay. Now I got to figure out like, okay, when I import from Zoom to PCR, how do I map that? Is that for you guys or is that, do I need to talk to Zoom about that? I'm not personally a Zoom user myself. However, I think through tickets that I've seen over time, there's like a UI in Zoom's UI that you can like when you're setting up the integration you can kind of like pick a field to go to or I might be thinking about Zoom Info right? It's like one word? Correct. Zoom Info. Yeah. Let me look at our ticketing system. I'm going to search Zoom Info and see if there's like any breadcrumbs of like screenshots of the UI or something. we've had plenty of people calling about zoom info in the past so there might be like a video or something but as uh as i go it looks in research i'm kind of doing like research now um okay So here, goal one, map new custom fields in Zoom info. All right, we have a goal, one goal. Any other goals today? Well, I'm trying, like, on the back end of Zoom, you know, they have to turn on that enterprise API in order for PCR to talk with Zoom. So I can just hit a button, you know, like enrich via Zoom. I think that's what it's called. So I'm dealing with that with Zoom. Now, once I get that figured out, then I wanted to figure out the mapping part of it because, you know, the information I get from Zoom, okay, I want it to say, okay, this is the cell phone number we had in PCR already. And then when I, you know, do the, you know, update via Zoom or I import a list, it's going to put, like, the phone number that it got from Zoom in the custom field for the email or the phone number. Does that make sense? And the reason I want to do that is because maybe the Zoom stuff isn't right. I don't want it to override my data that I already have. Does that make sense? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. So once we get, once I get, I'm waiting for Zoom on multiple things. Once I get some of that figured out, like that API thing that's going to talk to each other, then I need to figure out the mapping part. Okay. So that's when I'm going to need to talk to you guys again. You know what I mean? like, okay, they figured out the API part. Now, when I click this button, this is what I want it to do. Do you have a Zoom info account that you can log into and we can poke around in there and see? I just don't know. Well, I'm supposed to be talking to somebody from their integration team as well. I have a ticket out to that. I have like five tickets out to these guys right now. You know what I mean? But I can tell you, I mean, it's just been a wild ride in the...
