## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, Ms. Robin. Hey, what's up? Hey, I'm working with someone that they have a bunch of titles in their title pop-out that they don't want. I know that normally just displays any title that's on a record in the database. It depends. Is that using the title's table or just whatever exists? So they had the title field and then they changed it to title locked. Okay. But all the titles are still showing, not just the word. Oh, okay. So there's also a preference setting. So it's almost like you got to... Oh, for the user? Yeah, there's like use title table instead of slide. How is it worded? I want to say title lock means you can only select one in a dropdown. Like going forward. Let me think on this. But it's almost like if they really want to force going forward to just use the titles table, they have to. I believe it's two settings, if I remember right. If you go to the user preferences, it is under other, use title table instead of on the fly titles dropdown. It's right above the time zone. ah that's it and you gotta then do title locked perfect I don't really know why you have both but it is what it is I guess you know what I guess what it's for if you have title locked oh and also make sure they don't have title in there too because then it would still just pick up title make sure it's only title locked and I guess this is for like if they didn't have it like if they were to go to the pop out at the right, does it use the distinct or does it use the titles table? But then title locked means they can only pick from the table going forward. They probably just need both of those. Yeah, let me... Oh, I was filling stuff today. Kind of been neglecting this during support. now I'm like ooh I got a flood of emails from Kathy what about this client it's like yeah yeah they owe us big time oh that's perfect yep yeah you gotta kind of do both because you could do like the one where like if you went to the pop out without locking it it just was the pop out and then I don't know why like putting title lock doesn't override that though but gotta do both alrighty alrighty I appreciate it alrighty thanks alright thank you bye bye...
