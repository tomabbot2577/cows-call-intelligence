## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I don't know if we just spoke, but I was getting my RingCentral set up. Yeah, that was us. Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't seem to be working. I just clicked on a number, and it says check your mobile for further instructions or whatever, and then nothing happens. So I don't know. Does it take a little while? No, that should work right away. Let me just make sure of something here. Okay. I'm going to call right back. ah i see what it was okay there was an old old setting in there then it was set to mobile instead of ring central but that is now fixed do you have a test record that you can... I could try and call myself if I have my own name in there. Let me see. Let's see if I got something. It looks like I'm in there. Okay. I can try myself here and it will ring on my mobile phone. Hopefully it should put me on hold. Hopefully. oh I see yeah and it's it didn't do this before it's saying open ring central I get this thing yep that's where you can yep that's where you can click the checkbox yep hey there yep looks like it worked um yep i think it worked so we're we are good yeah you You had an old user preference that was trying to kick it to mobile still.
