## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Nain Frequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Well, that's a good question. I am trying to see who I need to speak with regarding the fidelity plan. I didn't know if Gretchen was the one who took over for Patsy. Sorry, that was so much. Oh, no, that's okay. Fidelity plan, meaning? 401K. Oh, okay. Okay. Let me check with my supervisor one second. Okay. And who should I say is calling? Oh, my name is Kelly with Blue Star. Patsy used to be my contact. We scheduled a review of the plan. She's just not there anymore. Right. Yeah. Patsy is left. Yeah. Let me check with my supervisor one second. Thank you. Okay, I went to Nick's voicemail. He might be on a call or something currently. Let me transfer you over to Nick Braddock's voicemail. He's my supervisor. If he's not the right person, he'll definitely get you to the right person. Perfect. Listen, sorry. You have a great weekend. Oh, you as well. Thanks so much. Thank you. Transferring you now. Thanks so much. Bye....
