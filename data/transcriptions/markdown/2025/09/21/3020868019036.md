## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Michael with Viewpoint. Hi. How are you? I'm doing good. I was just going to ask you something. I'm messing around with the PC recruiter right now, and I'm wanting to send out mass emails. Could you just point me in the right direction of where to start because I already have my script and everything I want to do? Where would I add that? So the content is – I assume you're just sending to a list of names, right? Yeah, so I have a roll-up list ready that I want to send out to. I just need to be able to put the content in, and then I want to click the names I want to send it to. Okay. Let me just make sure that I am looking at my notes for you guys because I don't want you to get your account blown up. Okay. What is your username? mkaroo. Okay. Bear with me one second. I want to double check everything. OK. Make sure that these are testing fine. Oops. Okay, that one's failing. Failing. Okay. Did you have to change your Gmail password recently since we did your Gmail setup? Okay. So there's going to be a couple things going on that we've got to have you fix first. Okay. All right. So at the very top right of Peace Recruiter, where you have your user image, there's the little gear icon that kind of floats on the edge. Click on that and then go to email. Okay. And then that's going to put up a new tab with your email settings. So right now things aren't like sending or receiving because you changed your Google password. so we'll need to change it fix it in two places we're going to go to configure up at the top okay and then go to mail servers gotcha and then you're gonna at the in the bottom half you're going to see my email that's your incoming mail server you're going to go to action and select edit let me know when you're there i'm there okay um there's a blue sign in with google option and you're going to need to sign into your google account gotcha so that way if you get replies and stuff it can be recognized okay i'm signed in okay once you're signed in and it's showing you in that mail server screen click test connection just to make sure that it's passing this time invalid credentials oh hang on yeah okay Because it didn't have me type it in. It seems like it just picked up my mind. So hang on. And then do I need to manually type in the password where it says username and password on the edit email server? No. When you use a sign-in with Google, it should be bringing back your credentials. It's going. I'm pressing sign-in with Google. I'm clicking on my email. Okay. And it says you're signing back into PC Recruiter recruitment and application tracking software. Oh, okay. At the bottom of that screen, I think you might have to hit, like, allow or something like that. It just says continue. Yeah. And then it's asking me to press continue and two different things. Should I press continue? I think so, yeah. Okay. It says continue. Give me my name. Oh, yeah. It says, okay. Okay, perfect. In that pop-up of the test, hit the X, and then in the mail server screen, click Save. Now that we know that it tested okay. So that's one thing. Correct. Perfect. Okay. The other thing that you're going to see once you're in PCR mail is called Alias Address List, which is your settings when you are logged in to send an email. so that was not authenticated either because everybody should set up for sending that everybody has the feature for the get me and coming to so that's why we have to authenticate in two places so once you click alias address list at the top you're going to see a card click the pencil option okay same thing sign in with Google basically same thing yes sign in with Google test it then save Okay. It says okay. Okay. And then place it. Okay. That's just making sure the email gets out. Now, one thing to be cautious of is when you are sending through Gmail, they don't let you send too many at once. How many people are in your roll-up that you're going to be? I have like 199, but I can do it in sections of 10 if I need to. Yeah, I would definitely keep it as low as possible just because Gmail and Office 365, They don't want to be like email blasting servers, and you don't want to jeopardize your account. Okay. Okay. So for the content, what you're going to do is go up to system. Okay. And go to form letters. It'll be in the upper left. Okay. And then you're going to go to name letters. Perfect. So these are basically all your email templates, if that makes sense. Okay. Okay. so um so emails so you have to do an email template because even like let's say you're sending to 10 people you're really sending to 10 you're really sending 10 separate emails and that way we give you the ability to say hello robin by inserting field data and so that's where they yeah like with the with the little quotation not quotations but the little uh double bracket yeah yeah yeah so when you go to add letter which is the plus symbol once you're above that list of...
