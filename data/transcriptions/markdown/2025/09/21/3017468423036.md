Yeah, let me get you over to the billing department. Give me one second here. We'll see if Robin is available here for you. Okay. It looks like Robin is currently on another call. what I can do is I can rant through you to her voicemail and then send her an email letting her know to give you a call back when she's available maybe you can help me out here maybe you can help me out because they changed the plan because I was on an automatic just on my visa and they were doing it automatically every month and they moved it to a new plan so I went into the system and because I'm in Ontario, it didn't have a drop down from Ontario. So I couldn't complete it to save it when I put all the information in. So I got a note again the next time and said, well, James, we made the change. Go in and I went in, I couldn't do it. So I saved my information and I put Ohio and it seemed to take. I'm unsure I have no idea what that payment portal looks like that's all handled on the billing department side yeah you can take a look at my at my account and tell me how many months I'm behind or what's the story I don't have access to any of that yeah all the billing stuff is separate yeah And then what's a good email address for you?
