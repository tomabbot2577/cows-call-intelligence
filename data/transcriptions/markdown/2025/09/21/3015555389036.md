Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and open it up. I'm going to go ahead and do that. Hi, Jim. Good morning. Heather, how are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Not too bad. Good, good, good. I'm just waiting on Albert here. Is Tony joining too? I think we had also CC'd him, or is he not coming today? I don't think he's joining today. I think just Albert. Perfect. Perfect. No worries. Yeah. So we'll take a look at the PCRM product and kind of run you through a little bit about what that does. Have you heard much about it? Have you seen it at all or anything? I saw it on like the landing page, like for PCR, like introducing PCRM. And then I watched the video on your like your learning center. I think it is. So I'm interested to see how it all works. I have questions, but I'll wait for Albert because I know he'll probably end up asking the same questions. Absolutely. Yeah, we'll give him a chance to get in, and then, yeah, we can take questions, show you what it does. It's primarily a new interface. There's a couple new features been added to it, more of a marketing-type thing, type features and such. So we can kind of take a look at that and talk about how it came to be. I'm going to just try and call, and so I'll be right back. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Amen. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, Jim, I'm not sure what's going on with Albert, but let's just proceed, and I'll take some notes. For sure. For sure. Yeah. So to talk a little bit about PCRM, this was kind of conceived several years ago, and it was originally going to be a change to the interface to PCRecruiter, PCR9, which is the current version of PCRecruiter. and they started changing the interface they kind of started adding a couple of things and what it was eventually decided to be they added a sales pipeline like a sales funnel which was a big thing people were asking for also a simpler version of the sequencing piece which is already in both versions so they actually designed it as a CRM named it PCRM and have launched it as a separate logon to the same database more with a CRM type look and feel CRM functionality and a completely redesigned interface. Now that being said, it's going to have almost everything the PCR9 has just in the new interface. So it may eventually replace PCR9, but right now there are no plans to stop PCR9 as most people still use it. But the PCRM is going to be, like I said, this new interface. I'm going to share my screen here just to kind of get logged in and show you a little bit about the basic look and feel of it. So getting logged in, like I said, same username, same password, same database, but you're able to log in through this new interface, which is a little bit more modular, a little bit more modern. So what we've done is rather than top to bottom, we put the screen or the buttons down the left-hand side of the screen. Many of them are even the same. So you see names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. A lot of those are the same buttons. Some are going to look the same. Some are going to look different. Some of the things like the sequences, the analytics dashboard, the schedule, those are going to look the same, primarily because when the sequences and analytics were created, we were already working on PCRM. So it was designed to look the same in both versions. So some of it is going to be an easy transition, but other areas are going to look pretty different. If I go to names, for example, you'll see it's now going to be a whole full screen. You have some search fields at the top, So I could look up part of a first name, part of a last name. So I can kind of go, it'll add little chips in there and you can add or reorganize them or whatever. It's also going to show you a recently viewed list, which you could edit in line. And you also have some quick actions here. So if you want, you can click right into this little three dots. and from there you're going to have the ability to contact them, email, call, SMS. You can add activities notes to roll-ups, submit a profile, so you can do a lot of the actions right from this main screen, or if you click on the individual's name, it's going to slide in from the right-hand side, and it's going to be a little bit different look and feel. Still the same terminology, the same elements at the top, like details, activities, resume notes. Easier to configure, though, so I can drag. Maybe I want to put my keywords a little bit further over. Drag and write extra resumes, it'll snap right over. And then you have this landing page, which is going to be your workspace, which is...
