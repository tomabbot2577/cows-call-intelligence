There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hello. It's Robin. Hi, Robin. How are you? I am fine. How are you doing? I'm okay. Oh, you're the two participants in the meeting. Yeah. Mark Anderson. Send us something that has nothing to do with our company in any way. Yeah, I replied back on it too. Before you did. Looks like a printing order. No wonder I was so confused. I'm like, I have no idea what's going on here. Yeah, but I'm like, I didn't send him anything. He's got nothing. I'm like, and even if it were quoted, it would have just been an email. I don't have any idea what it could possibly be. Yeah, and he doesn't do anything until the end of the year. So I was kind of like, what the heck are we talking about here? Thank you. Hello, Brent. How are you? Hey, good. Can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you just fine. Oh, perfect. Yeah, I wasn't sure. I forgot to plug in my camera. And it's got my voice and everything on it, so I wanted to make sure you could hear me. All good. All good. Glad you could join us today. And I don't know if you got the email or noticed that the data was just moved today. So the data is moved. It's ready to go under your link. Perfect. So we have that. So yeah, Robin, I don't know if you saw any of that. I don't know if I saw it yet, but I'm kind of buried in email stuff. I'm still digging through them. What's that noise? What's that noise? I don't hear a noise. Oh. It wasn't me. It did for a moment. Sound like a robot. Like, beep, beep, beep. All right. So I wanted to run through. So Robin is going to be your trainer at PC Recruiters. So she's going to be the one getting you trained up and running on the system there. and what we have today is just a few questions to kind of give her an idea about how you're going to use the system what pieces and what functions you want to set up and then all of that now Robin do you have the questionnaire do you want me to run through my version of it I I you can run through your own I really just take notes in a ticket so that way I don't have to go in five places to find out information. Perfect, yeah. So we'll have a couple of questions for you as we go, but just to talk a little bit about what you're going to be using and how you're going to be using the system and whatnot. And then once that's done, we'll get the first several calls on the schedule to get you up and running and get something scheduled out. Jim, before you get started, refresh my memory. Whose database or what database did he get? I'm going to make a note of that here. It was from Sean Reeves. Sean Reeves. Sean Reeves, okay. He worked, I think, for Custom Concrete and did recruiting for them and then gave him the data when he was done, I think is my understanding. Okay. That's correct. Okay. Okay. Okay. And so you're working in the concrete industry. You're hiring internally, right? Yes, we are. Okay. And you have direct hire, so it's internal. Are you on a Windows machine or a Mac? Windows. Perfect. And what's your preferred browser? It's the Internet Explorer one, whichever one that's... Oh, Edge? Edge? Yes. Okay. That'll work well. And then your email, who hosts your email? Is it Outlook or something else? BrentS at customconcrete.com. Okay, but do you use Outlook or Gmail or something else? Oh, I'm sorry. Outlook. I'm sorry. I got to turn the volume up a little bit. No, no worries. No worries. And do you have any additional data that you need to get into the system other than the data that's already been moved over? Do you have any resumes, spreadsheets, anything else you need to import? No, I do not. Okay. Okay. And are there any of our partnerships that you want to set up an integration to? Do you want to use RingCentral or ZoomInfo or Indeed or any of those? Indeed and LinkedIn would be, do you have one for ZipRecruiter as well? Yeah. Perfect. So Indeed, LinkedIn, and ZipRecruiter. Okay. Okay, and now that is all the standard questions that I have on this list. chair Robin is there anything else that you need to know yeah okay so hiring internally I'm sure yes okay So there's a premium package, okay, and it's just one user, right? Okay. Okay. Because you're doing hiring internally for yourselves, is the job order – I'm sorry, is the job board kind of like a priority to get going? So, like, can it, like, view your jobs and apply? Yeah, it would be nice. Okay. So, we don't want to put it off, like, too late then. Okay, let me look at our website. How's the concrete? We have one currently that we use. Shawn used something completely different. So, he has data that we were trying to use. And right now, we use ADP for our applicant tracking system.
