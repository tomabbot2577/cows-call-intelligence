 Hello, I can't come to the phone right now, so please leave a message and I'll call you back. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail that you're having trouble in PCR. Sorry we missed you there. I'm going to try emailing you back through a support ticket, seeing maybe if I can help you out with, I think you said it was a copying user settings between users. So look out for an email from me and hopefully we get that figured out for you. Thanks....
