## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? It's Chris. I lost you when I hung up. Oh, yeah, no problem. So, yeah, I just wanted to call you back and let you know it's working now. It's all working? Okay, good. That's awesome. I will – I'll close our ticket. But, yeah, if you have any other – Just so you know for the future, yeah, because I went through all the steps, and I was like, something's not right. I can't find what he's talking about. Now, the phone number that, when I dialed myself, I have two different phone numbers for RingCentral. One of the numbers came up. Can I change the number that it comes from? Yes. Yeah, you would have to go into the system settings and change the phone number that is associated with that username. And then once you make that change, you'll go back and disconnect your RingCentral status and reconnect it. So I can walk you through that. Are you logged into PCR currently? Yeah, because just so I can explain, I have two company numbers. I have a company number that I'm dialing from now, which I have to put in an extension to get to me. And then I have a direct line. So I think I'd want to use the direct line, right? or would I want to leave the other one maybe if I have other users? Would that make more sense? So if you have other users, they can enter in their own phone number each time when they connect to RingCentral. So, yeah, maybe your direct line would be better for your setup. Okay. Yeah, so to adjust that, click on System in the main menu at the top center of PCR. Okay. And then on the left, go to Users, and then Manage Users. Okay. I see the – that's weird because the phone number that's in here under C or T is the number that I want it to be. Okay, yeah. When I just called myself, the caller ID came up with a different phone number. Okay, yeah, we'll investigate and make sure that it's the same and there's three places it can be listed. So go to click on your username from the CRT's username in that list. And then in the bottom frame, there's it says contact information, it has a contact phone number. Make sure that that is the correct one. Okay. Then click the little gear icon to the right of that. And under the phone number and direct dial number fields, does that have the correct number as well? It does. Okay. So, yeah, on the PCR side, everything is set for that phone number. it may be a setting in RingCentral that it's showing up as a different number. When you log in to RingCentral, when you were clicking on that RingCentral status on the MyPCR page, are you logging in by a phone number or by your email address to connect that RingCentral status? Well, I logged into the app for RingCentral, and when I go under the phone under settings, it has my default caller ID as the 2505, which is not the right number. Oh, that could be it. So there's a drop-down here where I can put primary, which is 754-351-36. That might be the fix. Yeah, it seems like a RingCentral setting. rather than PCR aircraft. Okay, perfect. So that should alleviate my problem. Okay, perfect. Well, Garrett, thank you so much for your help. Yeah, happy to help. Definitely reach out if you need anything else. All right. Enjoy the rest of your Monday. You too. Bye....
