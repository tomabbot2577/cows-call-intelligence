## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Oh, hi, Robin. How are you? It's Adam Kaplan from CapThera. Hi. How are you doing? Doing great. I wanted to check. It looks like it says invoices have been processed and there's a receipt, but then it also says there's a payment overdue. Can you let me know if payments have been taken or not? Because I keep getting conflicting emails. Okay. Let's see. consulting You have a July 1, July 20th, which is paid, but then June 20th is still open. Okay. I have no idea how that happened because they were both automatic payments. All right. So, yeah, I'm wondering why. because you paid so we did switch invoice systems yes and we moved you away and then so it looks like your first one on july 16th or april 16th which is like the makeup or what what a process you paid that one a week later on the 23rd and then the may one was paid on the 19th but then this june the may one was not paid until june 19th but why was it june 20th because you We probably set a bottle for you by then. Let me see. You know, I had spoke with you, and then it wound up being late because it said it had processed, but it never did one of them. And I think we paid that. And then it seems like if the June 20th wasn't paid, that was supposed to be the next one. But it wouldn't make sense that the July one was paid if the June one didn't take. So I don't know. Yeah, on June 19th, it paid the May one. Let me see. Okay. Let me see if there is any kind of transactions. Let's see. There's some card declined on June 20th. Okay. Do you want me to try it now? You know what? Let me give you a different one. I don't know why. It doesn't work out well when I try to replace it for you, it seems, because it wants you to, like, put in, like, extra details. Let me see what happens. Can I try to cross the screen? You can send me where I can just update it myself and then process it with you on the phone? Okay, thank you. Yeah, let me see. Customer portal, send invitation. Now your more recent one looks like, let me see, invoices. Where is I? I was in history, transactions. Your last one on July 20th did go through, but on January 20th, it didn't. so it might just be trying to reprocess this one. All right. So now it's asking me to create an account. Yeah, so if you have not been in the customer billing portal, you'll want to create an account. It's just for billing. It doesn't use anything related to PCR. Okay, so let me do this right now and just make sure we're in here. So it's in the vault area where you can manage your card. But if you want to delete the card, you've got to turn off auto-pay for it first. Then it lets you delete it. Okay, let me just get into here and put a sign up here. Okay, I guess I'm human. Now log into my account. I just use my email then, correct? Yeah, and make sure you use adam at capstarrow.com because that's the account we have for billing. Now it says invalid login attempt. I just... And you set up this billing part. Did it ask you to create a password for the site? It did and I just you put in the password that I just created and it's now it's saying invalid login attempt. Did it say anything about it's going to email you to make sure it's you? It did not refresh my email no nothing that's okay now I'm in all right let's see here so it's in the vault area where you manage the card. Vault, okay. Okay, so before it lets you delete a card, you have to turn off the auto-pay option in the vault area for that card. On invoices, go to no. Okay, now hit save on that? Yeah. Okay. Then it should give you a list of your cards and then you can delete that one? It doesn't give me an option to delete. It gives me an area to put a new card. Okay, it doesn't list what cards you have? It does. It doesn't. I don't have an option to delete it, though. Oh, no, that's a different area. Sorry, I was looking back where it said involved. Now I see. So delete this one. Yeah, you've got to be in that involved area. Okay. Now that's deleted. Okay, so then you're adding a new payment method. New card, okay. so let me get to that now let me just find that Okay. auto pay for future transaction save and now hang on a second Okay, select. Now where do I, does it go to say make payment? Is this, I think I just found the auto pay. So that's in the invoice area. Okay, invoices it shows. Invoice number. See, it didn't take that card. It's saying still pay with that old card. Click here. Let me see in the vault. It still has that card saved even though I got rid of it. Okay. So when you, so do you have two cards listed? It's only showing one. I'm trying to put a different card in. Let me delete this again. This is payment will be deleted. Okay. Please cancel auto pay before deleting it. Okay. So over at the auto. I think when you're in the voluntary, it's like above. It's like a yes, no drop down. Yes. And it's on no. And it said save. And it just. Okay. I clicked it again. So now it says it did this before to auto pay was succes...
