## 💬 Full Transcript

 here. Tyler's on the line. Go ahead and take it away, Tyler. We've got Ed on the line. How's it going, Ed? Good. You? Going good. Going good. So thanks again for letting us test using your account. What we're going to do now, I'm coordinating with the QA and development team just to get them in as well so they can go in and start fixing stuff. So let me message him right now. So let them know that he can go ahead and try and log in and that way it'll trigger those two-factor authentications. Yes. And the codes that we'll need. Then just let me know if you get like an email or a text. I'm monitoring it. He says it's waiting for a code now. Okay. The code is 635 794 Oh right And then we'll just make sure it doesn't do the two code one like it did for us last time Okay Yep now it's saying he needs another code Yeah, the code that was just texted to me is 607-160. 607-160? Correct. Perfect. All right. He said he's in. Okay, great. So this should be fixed soon, I guess? We're hoping so. Capture is always a little weird. Okay. Just especially when websites make major changes to the coding of the page. But I was working with him yesterday, and we seemed to find what the issue was. Now it's just a matter of writing the code to fix it. Got it. Got it. All right. Wonderful. Yeah. And like I said, one thing to note with this too, is when we do make fixes to capture and publish them, it does sometimes take a little bit for Google to accept that new version of the extension. So just something to be aware of, but we'll keep you informed on what's going on. Okay. And when to expect it to be back up. Wonderful. Wonderful. Well, thank you so much for your help, Tyler. I appreciate you. Hey, thank you too, Ed. We wouldn't be able to do this without you. No worries. Thanks, Garrett. Thanks. Take care, guys. Have a good day. Bye. Bye....
