## 💬 Full Transcript

 Colleague Main Sequence Technology, this is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi there. I was wondering if I could get some help with setting up like linking my email to PCR. Yeah, what company are you with so I could get you pulled up here? It's Summit Employment. All righty, just a second here. And were you setting up the Outlook portal or like the IMAP within PCRecruiter itself? I'm not sure I just know that I need to link my email and then I believe also RingCentral to PCR. Okay let me see here. So with the RingCentral, let me check to see if your admin has done their part yet. What's your username in the database? For PCR? Yes. Hold on a second. at Seawalker. Okay. So your admin hasn't done their part for the RingCentral, so they would need to do part on their end first for that. Okay. Will they automatically know what needs to be done? I'll send you over the instructions to give. Okay. And that'll include what you need to do on your end as well. Okay. But we can't just go in and change user settings. Mm-hmm. So an admin at your office will have to do that part. Okay. Let me just take a look here at how these other people are set up with email. That will give us a good indication of what we're trying to set up. All right. checking one more user to be sure here. Okay, so it looks like you are using the Outlook portal. Do you have the classic Outlook installed on your computer? I believe I do, yes. Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is just start up a video meeting here, then I'll send you a link to join via email. Okay. We can hop on a screen share and I can walk you through that setup process. Then what is a good email address for you? Okay it's Callie, C-A-L-L-I-E, at Summit Employment. Perfect. All right, I just sent you over that meeting link. I'm also going to email you over the setup instructions for RingCentral that your admin will need. If you see like computer audio and video you could just exit out of it since we're already on the phone here. Okay. Okay. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share you'll want to share your entire screen it's okay I think it yep it's coming over now perfect all right you go ahead ahead and minimize RingCentral. Okay. Oh it looks like you only shared that window and or that application and not the entire screen. So go ahead and hit the stop share. Then under entire screen you should if you have multiple screens you'll see a few different options. You'll just click on one of the screens preferably the one that you have Outlook on and then yep perfect all right so yeah the first thing we're gonna do is make sure that you have the Java and launcher installed so go ahead and open up and okay go ahead go ahead and open up a new tab you go to PC recruiter net and then you can do the PC recruiter downloads that pops up. Oh, that works too. Go to technical info, then downloads. We're going to scroll about three-quarters of the way down the page here where it says PCR launcher click on the where it says PC exe we're just going to leave that there for one second before opening it and then go to where it says Java Amazon Coreto over on the left then go ahead and scroll down okay then in that platform box go ahead and scroll up a little you'll see that there's that other scroll down go ahead and scroll down just a little bit there that where it says that Windows x86 you're going to click that link next to where it says JDK to the right of it yep yep we're going to run that one first okay so open Yep. The top one here. Yep. Then you might see something pop up asking if it's okay to make changes. You'll just hit yes. Okay. Install. Okay. Then did that installer open on a different screen? It did. I think I'm going to pull the next one over so you can see it. Yep. Go ahead. That one's good. Yep, go ahead and hit open file. You might see that same pop-up again. Go ahead and hit next. Okay, you can just hit cancel here. That means you have it already. Okay. So that's good. And just go ahead and hit finish. Okay. And then this one? So that one you already have. That's just the RingCentral app. Okay. So let's go ahead and click the back arrow to go back to the downloads page. Then go ahead and scroll up in this list a little bit. You'll see that portal, EXE, the PC recruiter for Microsoft Outlook. Okay. Yep. Then we'll just run that when it's done. That'll do the same thing again. All right, and then go ahead and open up Outlook, the installed Outlook. at the bottom it looks like you have over here hold on let me pull this over actually I can't it says PC recruiter portal and then it says please enter All right, that number that you're going to enter is 124-726-281-961-622.
