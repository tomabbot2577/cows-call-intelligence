## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainTube for Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Sorry, I had a microphone issue there. No, that's okay. That's okay. I just had a quick question. I'm Bob Leavitt with Brandon Becker. If I want to add a category to status on a candidate's record, how do I do that? I didn't know if I go into custom fields or database setup. You know, I have a custom field I created called status. And, you know, with a pull down and I could have candidate, a hiring authority, place, whatever. But I'd like to add a category. Hello? Hi. Sorry, I caught the tail end of that. I'm so sorry. My RingCentral. Can you hear me okay? call I took today and my ring central didn't have my audios. I took the, okay. Got the tail end. You wanted to add a category. Um, could you perhaps start again? I'm so sorry to ask you to do that, but, um, that's quite all right. Not a problem. Okay. You know, I, I created a, uh, yeah. Hello. Uh, what? Yeah. Hello. Oh my God. Hold on. Hold on. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. What is happening? I'm okay. The audio, when I changed the speaker, it changes the microphone and they're different and I don't know why this is happening. Okay, then let me try to be quick. I have a custom category called status. I want to add something to it. How do I do that? That's some category status. Okay. I have a category, a custom category called status and I'd like to add something to it. Where do I do that? Is it in custom fields, database setup? In the category, do you mean when you are sending an email campaign? No. I have everybody as a status. You're either a candidate or you're a hiring authority. I see, on a name record. It's a pull down on a name record. On a name record, the field status. You have a custom status. I got you. Sorry, the status is used in a lot of screens. Yep. Custom status. How do I add to it? Sure. Let me take a look at your – could you – I forgot. I didn't catch your name. No, let me tell you again. Don't worry about it. It's all good. The company is Branson Becker, and the database is 2024. Let me catch up to you. Let me log in and take a look at it. All righty. And then just go into any candidates record and in the middle it says particulars and the first category is status. I got your 2024. I had to look up the URL. I got it though. What's the username you log into the database with, if you don't mind? Sure. B-Levitt. L-E-V-I-T-T. What was the first letter? V? B? B as in Bob. B as in Bob. Thank you. B. Levitt. All right. B. Levitt. And then do a name. Troy Owens. And you said scroll down a little-ish. See where it says particulars? and then the first one is in the middle, status. Yeah, candidate, hiring authority, offer accepted, place. Right, I want to add something to that. Have you added something to this before? Well, I created all of those. You created all of those? Oh, okay, okay, okay. Right. There is a, okay, let me take a look at the setup of the page because there is a deep, like a predefined field. Oh, that is the predefined field. Okay. Let's find it. There must be a setting, right? Did you search in the system menu for it or you just? I went into system menu yes I just didn't know I went into custom fields and I went to name custom fields and then the first one is status and it's if you go into that go into custom yeah I see yeah that's the main one that's not the same one because I hit default values and I added something and that's not right right I see I see that it's uh on your layout that's the predefined status field. Okay, so it's not that I don't go to custom fields. I go to database setup. I just deleted it because that's not right. So where do I go? Am I now in database setup? Where do I go to add that? Let me help you find it because I'm not off the top of my head. I'm not sure, but clearly you have a status that is not defaulted into the database. So there must be a way I could definitely find it. for you or with you. Yeah, database setup would be a good guess. I'm looking through it as well. There are other ways for information on this. Tickets in the past are sorts that will lead me to the steps to change it. Because what I'm looking at on the database setup, I don't see the ability to add something to that. Industry specialty codes, maybe? No, no. No, that's the industry specialty field. I know that wouldn't change the status field. I've dealt with that section of the software plenty of times. What about configure record cards? No? No, that's more of like the little rectangle you see in the recently viewed screen, or maybe perhaps in the newer version of the pipeline in VCR 9 where you can, like, drag and drop them from left to right. And it's like a little card where you see there. How about this? I think I got it. I think I got it. I don't know. Are you ready? What I was thinking? So I clicked on Troy Owens, right, and his record comes up. And then I hit the little gear icon to the right. and when I hit the gear, it comes up w...
