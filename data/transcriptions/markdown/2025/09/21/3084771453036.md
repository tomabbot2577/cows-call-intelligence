## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Mini-Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, this is JP Wright. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. I'm not sure if you remember me or not. We use PC Recruiter. I've talked to you numerous times about support issues. I have some questions about how our database is set up I'm trying to use SourceWale and apparently there's an issue with like how our database is set up and I'm trying to understand like how some of our fields were set up I'm not sure if you're someone that could help me with that or sure yeah I could try I'll go about kind of figuring some of this stuff out yeah i can so from what i'm gathering like we're having integration issues with source whale because it seems like we have a bunch of like custom fields and for whatever reason i guess their their build doesn't work well with um it's not working well with custom fields so okay they basically said that they have to rebuild what they are doing because of how ours works. I'm trying to figure out, whenever I look at the fields that we're using, it looks like there's a lot of them that are listed as custom fields. It seemed like they should just be fields that you guys would have. Okay. Okay. But they're not. They're all just set up as custom fields. So I'm trying to figure out if there's a way that we can kind of move some things around so that we don't have as many custom fields. Sure. Let me log in as your username here. Is it JPW? Yeah. Okay. Let me take a look at what fields you have listed on your name records. words. What fields in particular were you looking to maybe change or? So basically anything that's a custom field, if we can change it to a predefined field that you guys already have. I know that there's some of them that we won't be able to, like this class and code that we have in group one. I know that we won't be able to change those. and if we don't change those, like, it's perfectly fine. Like, that's not something that they need to integrate with. It seems like the biggest issue that they're having is our phone fields and email fields and location fields. So, like, the custom direct phone that we have, the custom work email, custom alt email, custom alt email 2, custom LinkedIn, workstation, custom work state. Gotcha. So there are some fields in PCR that are listed as custom, but they come preloaded with PCR. One example would be the custom field called the social underscore LinkedIn. I think it's just called custom because it was developed by our developers after our initial build of PCR. The predefined fields have been there since the beginning. If our developers have developed additional preloaded fields that come with PCR since then, they will come up as custom. So like social underscore LinkedIn is always going to be custom. The ones, let's see, of the ones you mentioned, let's see. Work phone is predefined. That's good. Direct phone, we don't have a field for that. So that will always be custom. Cell phone, home phone are predefined. We do have a field called email underscore work. Instead of the custom field you have called work email. But in both cases, they are a one of those custom fields. Even the one we created and comes preloaded, it's still a custom field. Email underscore work. Okay. the email address you've kind of just renamed it to personal which is fine it's just like a correct on the face of things but in reality it's still email address and that one's good alt email alt email 2 we don't really have a field for that custom do you have additional email you have additional email fields like a home email or Email underscore other, email underscore home. We do have those. They will still be considered custom. They're still considered custom, though. Okay. Yeah. So let me ask you this. The ones that are listed as, like I see some of them are custom, like capitalized custom, and some are lowercase custom. Does that determine anything? I'm not exactly sure. I'm not sure why it's doing that because the custom all email to is a custom field you created, but so is like work city. And those don't have a correlation with how things are capitalized. So I'm not exactly sure where those capitalizations are coming from, but I don't think we could use it as an indicator to see which ones came with PCR or not. Okay. Yeah. The location information, we do have address city state zip as predefined fields, but you already have those right below the custom ones. Yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, most of these things are are don't really have something to be switched over to unless you wanted to switch, you know, work email over to email underscore work. but that still is considered a custom field. And it's going to still be listed as a custom field. Right. Like, okay. So they were, and that's one of the things that like they seem to think that it had something to do with, like the issue that we had had something to do with the fact that we have these custom fields. okay oh yeah ...
