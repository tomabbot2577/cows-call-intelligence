## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Yes, this is Robin. Thank you for calling me. Okay. Sorry, you broke up a little bit. Hi. I started to go with Red Tide, and I have, I guess, to download something so I can open an attachment. We have an accompanying profile. Deanna said just to give you guys a call for help. Okay, yeah, there's a couple apps that you have to install. It just kind of depends on your operating system. And I can send you those links over. Let's see. Bear with me one second here. Hold on. I've got too many windows open. Okay. what is your name Amy Nelson okay let me add it to red kite And what is your email address? Amy, A-M-Y, at redtightrecruiting.com. Okay. I'm giving you the links that you'll need. So for PCR to work correctly on your computer, you said your Windows, right? Yes. Okay. So you have to add Java and what's called the PC Recruiter Launcher because the launcher was actually opening our add resume screen, alarms, and also allowing it to open attachments. And then it also needs Java. I just sent you an email. Let me know when you get that. Okay. And if you're in PC Recruiter now, you might as well go ahead and log out. Okay. Because you'll need to log back in anyway afterwards. Okay. Okay, so let me know when you're out of there. And then back to my email. Okay. I'm out and back to email. Okay. All right. So there's going to be two apps that we have to install. They're listed under where it says Windows. The first one is Java. So go ahead and download that file. And then once it's done downloading, you're going to open and run that file. It's asking, like, for do you want this. Does it have to make changes to your device? You need to hit yes. I can usually hear that ding. Out of date Java version detected. Okay. So uninstalled. So, yeah, that means you probably already had Java. So is it at the end where it already tried to install and that was like at the very end? Yeah. Okay. So go ahead and uninstall. Yeah. That way you only have one version. Because basically what it's saying is you're replacing with a new version. Do you want to get rid of the old one? Okay. I've successfully installed. Okay. Perfect. Okay. So then you're going to go back to the email I sent you. And you're going to go to the second link under Windows where it says PC Recruiter Launcher for Windows. Okay. All right. Set up wizard. Yeah, you'll basically just go like, I accept. Next. I, you know, kind of. Two setup types, typical or custom? Typical. In my 19 years here, I've never had to use custom. I'm not really sure why that's an option. It's always typical. Just in case. Okay, so my computer stopped doing things, so. Okay. I think I'm good. Okay, so once that's done, so it went through the process. Sometimes it's kind of slow in the beginning, then kicks in and runs. It all looks good? The window, like, it swirled and the window closed out. Okay, you probably ran pretty fast then. Okay, so what I'm going to have you do now is go to your PCR login page and log in. But the first time you log in, you're going to see some extra prompts that I'm going to talk you through. Okay. Okay. So once you hit log in, the first one's going to be your browser asking if you want to open the PCR control loader. There's a little checkbox. Hit that checkbox. Oh, okay. It's not logging in. My password is not working, which is weird. Hmm. I'm sure caps lock is off too. Yeah, okay. Open control loader. Okay, so before you click that, there's a checkbox. Hit the checkbox. That way you're telling your browser it's okay to run this when I go to the site. Otherwise, I get that option all the time and it gets annoying. Okay. And then after you do that, it's going to tell you about checking for an update. New version is required. Yes. Click Allow. Okay. And then that should do it. You should now be able to open attachments. and if you went to like a company record and were using ad resume, that would work as well. Let's try that. I was looking for someone's pay agreement earlier. And I'm like, I say action, I see open, it's doing nothing. Let's see what this is. CC Recruiter Loader is not running. Oh, and you checked that box and then said open, right? Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's have you log in one more time. Okay. That's that launcher tool that it's looking for. again okay I'm back in again all right let's try this again I already said. Yeah. Something's not right. So. You have RingCentral, right? Yes. Yes. It says PC Recruiter Loader is not running. And I hit OK, and it says PC Recruiter Loader is not running. It just said the same thing twice. Oh, that's really weird. Okay, so let's do a screenshot. You have RingCentral. If you open up RingCentral, go to Video and select Join. And let me know when you're ready for a meeting ID. Okay, I'm ready. Okay, it's going to be 050-394-810. Now, once you get in, it's going to ask you about joining with computer audio. You're going to want to not join with audio since we're already on the phone. Got it. Okay. All right. Join w...
