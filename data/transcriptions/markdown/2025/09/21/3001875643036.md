## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Tracy, and I am with Symbio. And in PCR, none of my emails are logging. Oh, okay. Let me take a look. I'll just log into your database here. Are you in the Symbio Partners, Inc., or Symbio Read Only? I'm assuming that's the first database. is and I think it's the former of those two. Okay. What's your PCR username? I just went blank. Well shoot. Are you currently logged into PCR right now? I am. If you hover over the profile picture area at the top right, there's a circle up there it'll tell you your username and what database you're in. And just as it's not saying anything bear with me I'm sorry. No problem. Here what I can do actually I'll log in as the admin and then just kind of check the user list. Oh, T. Johnson, that's your username. Okay, thank you. No problem. I'll just re-log in T. Johnson. And let me check your email settings. Okay, so it looks like you do not have an incoming or outgoing email set up in PCR. So do you use PCR to send and receive emails, or are you mostly in Outlook? Yes. No, I use PCR, and it's always worked. It just stopped the last couple of days. I noticed it late last night. Okay, yeah, so in the T. Johnson username, you do not have an outgoing email connected or an incoming email connected. So I can show you how to set that up. Please. So go to the gear icon in a circle to the right of that profile picture. Okay. It's got a drop-down menu, and then the first option will be email. Okay. Go ahead and click on that. That opens up PCR mail in a new tab. And you'll want to go to configure at the top left, which is another gear icon. Okay. And then we'll start by setting up the incoming mail. So go to mail servers below that. Okay. And in the bottom frame, click the three horizontal lines at the top right of the bottom frame. Okay. And select add. Okay. And who is your email provider? Is it Gmail or Office 365? It's Gmail. Okay, cool. Go ahead and hit sign in with Google, the bottom left there. Okay. And it should prompt you to sign in to the correct Gmail address. Okay. And once you're all signed in, it'll fill out all the fields in the add mail server pop-up window for you. And then do I hit save? Check on, there's a, in the bottom center, there's a dropdown that says save sent email to sent items folder. Switch that to no. Gmail will duplicate your sent items. Okay. And then go to test connection at the bottom. We're hoping to see green lettering somewhere in that test result. There is no green lettering. It says lookup failed. Okay. Go ahead and hit save at the bottom, and then I'll refresh on my end, and I'll be able to see what got entered in there. One second. Refresh. Configure mail servers. Okay. See it started there. Okay, ready for requests. Lookup failed. Okay. I have not seen that one before. We'll do a test though in a minute here. Nope, yeah, it doesn't look like it is working. Sign in with Google. Test connection. Okay, let's try this. Go to Configure again at the top, and then Alias Address List. Okay. And then in the bottom frame, click on the pencil icon to edit that alias. Okay. And then hit Sign In with Google at the bottom left there. And that should fill in most of the fields for you. Let me know if it... It did. Okay. Does Reply To have something entered in on the right there? Reply To address? It does not. Okay. Go ahead and copy the From address on the left over to Reply To on the right so that those match. Okay. And then right below that it'll say maps server select the server use that drop down to select the Gmail mail server we just created okay and then finally bottom left it says delay between emails set that to 3000 okay and then hit test connection at the bottom of that and let me know if you see green lettering I do oh excellent so that's good that's the outgoing mail you You can close the test and then hit save. And then, let's see, we will maybe have to create an app specific password for the other one we were doing. Yeah, okay. So are you using a Google Chrome browser or Microsoft Edge? I, it's Chrome. Okay, good. So at the top right of your browser there, it should have like a, either a profile picture or the first letter of your name in a circle. It does. Okay, awesome. Click on that and then go to manage your Google account. Okay. Okay. And that'll open up your Google. On the left, go to security. Okay. And let's see, there's a heading called how you sign into Google. At the top there of that heading, let's see, yeah, two-step verification. Does that have a green check mark next to it? It does. Okay, excellent. So, two-step is on. Next, we'll look at app. Okay, so then in the search bar at the top where it says search Google account, type in app password, app space password. Okay.
