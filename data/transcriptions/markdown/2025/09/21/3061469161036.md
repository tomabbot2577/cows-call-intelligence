 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just... You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hey, Jim. Good morning, Dean. How are you? Great. How are you? I'm well. I'm well. Yeah, thanks for joining me today. I understand you want to look around the PCRM product a little bit. Yes. Okay. Perfect. Yep. All right. And have you seen it? Have you heard about it? Have you taken a look at all? Or is this your first time? Are we on camera? Not on camera. Okay, not on camera. I don't remember. No, that's okay. Don't worry. I don't remember. Yeah. Well, let me show you around a little bit. So I don't know how much you've heard about the PCRM. What it originally was was slated to be, it was going to be a redesign for PCR nine. So it was going to be nine became 10 and they were going to push everybody over And what happened is they were working on it for so long and they added kind of some extra CRM features. So they decided early this year, maybe April ish to roll it out as its own separate product. but that it would share the same database as PC Recruiter. So it's called PCRM because it is a CRM. So that's where we arrived at the PCRM name for it. So what it is, it is something that you can add and use alongside the current PC Recruiter because it shares the same database real time. It's going to give you everything PCR9 has, but it's going to give you a new format for all of that, and it's going to add simpler sequencing, some easier data entry. it's going to add a whole sales pipeline for forecasting if that is something of interest to you so that's kind of some of the big things that it will add as you look through there so I'll kind of show you around just so you can kind of get a flavor of what it looks like and how it's going to work okay do you see my screen all right yep fantastic fantastic so as I get logged in I'm going to log into my database here let's see and I'm going to be logged into the system it's going to pop right up with the dashboard the my pcr screen there uh you'll see it's got different kind of different looking widgets uh so you can have like recently modified recently viewed you can hop up in your little pencil up here there's a host of different things you can throw a video in there some text instructions am i we already have this i'm confused like it's already accessible no it is accessible i don't think you have it though because it is something you would have to upgrade to add essentially Okay. So it's something that is available should you wish to add it, and it could be added to your existing database so that you could have people logging on via this link instead of your current link. So you see kind of what we've done. Rather than top and bottom, those frames that we have right now, we've put the menu on the left side of the screen. So you're going to see a lot of similar buttons, names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. A lot of those are going to be the exact same terminology but they're going to look quite different for example if I go into my names the name menu is going to look totally different it's now going to keep the most recently viewed records it's going to be a little bit longer of a scroll a little bit few more than we used to offer and you're going to have some things like the ability to edit in line the ability to perform an action right from the main list here you can send an email call text with ring central even gives you different numbers if you had multiples it'll kind of let you pick which one you could add an activity at a note put them on a roll up so you can do a little bit more from the front screen here you're also going to have a simple search at the top so if I wanted to look up Jim Lombardo I could just type in Jim and it's going to add these little green chips as I go through here and add different search strings different search criteria then I can X them out drag them in a different order do some different things there it's still going to support the same boolean search logic it's still going to give you kind of a ranking of the best matches, still going to highlight the words it found. So that's all going to remain unchanged. But a big thing we've done is redesign how this looks and how this works. So if I click on a record, rather than sharing the screen, it's going to slide in from the right-hand side of the screen, kind of go right over. It's going to default to halfway, but you're going to full screen it here, and you have your configurable record within PC Recruiter. A lot of these are the same terminology, like activities, resumes, positions, attachments, all the same terminology, but the screens have been redesigned and refreshed. We've also added a workspace and what that workspace does, that gives you the ability to design a custom screen right here that's going to let you put only what you want to see kind of by default. Maybe i...
