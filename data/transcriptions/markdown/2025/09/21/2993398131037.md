**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Hi, this is Kevin.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Can I help you?

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** Hello, Kevin.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** It's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Hey, Jim.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** What's going on?

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I just wanted to give you a call and find out kind of just what you needed.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** I'm going to have one of my techs give you a call, one of my support people here.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** So the mail folders, you're looking to set up integrated IMAP email within PC Recruiter?

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I've already done all the boxes and all that stuff.

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** I just need somebody to stack out the folders for me.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** I can't do – there's one step that you do.

**[0:35] Speaker_00:** So you log in as the user, open email configuration gear, preferences, left side, lower section.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Here's where the incoming mail goes.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** I can't figure out where to set up the first mailbox and then have it automatically terrace underneath it.

**[0:49] Speaker_01:** Okay, okay.

**[0:51] Speaker_01:** So we want to get all of the folders set up from their Gmail or whatever in PC Recruiter?

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:56] Speaker_00:** If you look at Ryan, who's the person I'm trying to set up, he's already got his bulk mail, his regular mail.

**[1:08] Speaker_00:** I just need to get the folders set up so in-mail can come, trash can go, sent can go, that kind of stuff.

**[1:15] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** Sounds like that's IMAP folder integration there.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** And then API key, I will put that in the ticket.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** and then the mail folders, what I'll do is I'll see if they have something they can reference.

**[1:28] Speaker_01:** I'm in sales, so I just kind of gather information to get support to give you a call.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** And Josh is no longer with the company.

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** Did you guys have a massive turnover?

**[1:38] Speaker_00:** What has happened here?

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** I've been with you guys forever, and I've never not been able to get a hold of somebody.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** We've had some changes, and we did have several technical and support people leave, and we're bringing on a new one very soon.

**[1:52] Speaker_01:** So we've had some turnover.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** Josh left.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** We've had some new management come in.

**[1:56] Speaker_01:** So we've changed it up a bit.

**[1:57] Speaker_01:** So we have had a little bit of turnover.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** Gotcha.

**[2:00] Speaker_01:** We're kind of getting things back corrected.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** So is Tyler still with you or is he gone?

**[2:05] Speaker_01:** He's gone too.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** That's too bad.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** He was a good guy.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** He was great.

**[2:08] Speaker_00:** Robin is still there, I guess.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** Yeah, Robin is still here.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** I think she had reached out.

**[2:14] Speaker_01:** But I'm going to put in a ticket to the team and have the first person who's available reach out to get something.

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:20] Speaker_00:** So here's the drawback.
