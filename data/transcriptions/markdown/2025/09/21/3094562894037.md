## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, this is Tyler, a PC recruiter. Give me a call back. Hi, you figured it out already? Well, I don't know if I figured it out. Just a few things with you. Do you know what iOS version your phone is on? What would I find in it? Let me see. It's usually just like in your system settings. It'll tell you like the device information and what iOS version it's running. iOS 18.6.2. That's the version I'm on. Okay, so that is... The latest. Well, no, the latest version is 26. What? Yeah, iOS 26. I don't know, my phone just did update. a couple weeks ago. Yeah, the person that I had tried said that they were on iOS 26. So let me, I'm going to try sending you the app invite on my app here. Oh, my God. So, yeah, it says, oh, yeah, IO 26 is the next upgrade, but it's tonight's schedule for me. Okay. Yeah, when you're clicking that big blue box that said update, right? Yeah. Okay. It's nothing but copy it, yeah. Thank you. I just sent that to you one more time from the same person who had been sending you it. Okay. I just got it. Okay. Now, do I need to delete the app again and put it back on? No. As long as you haven't opened it, you're good. I don't know. I'm just deleting it again and putting it back. That's all I've been doing because I don't know. I'm just – It's only in two seconds, so it don't matter. It's only already there fast. I ain't opened it, but okay. So now do what? Then once it's fully downloaded and installed. It is. I already see it. It's downloaded there fast. It was done in a second. And I go back to the email and click on the actual text that says activate because that's the part where the link's at. Yeah, I know. Right. And I'm doing it. Nothing's there. still not kicking over which email app are you using are you using just like the generic Apple email app or are you using like the Gmail app I'm using my Gmail app okay um let me Let me try this. I'm going to try sending you a different type of letter here. All right. Just a very basic one. Let's see if that does the trick. A basic what? Just like a very basic app invite letter without like all the extra text and stuff. Oh, okay. Yeah, I shut my phone off, let it sit, everything. I don't know. I just sent that one to you. Okay, I got it. So open that? Yep. And try hitting that activate on that one. See if that works. Nope. Nope. Won't copy. I don't know. I mean, it won't just click like you click on the app and go over to the store. It don't do nothing. with this one either. Excellent. And everything's coming to my spam, so I have to go to my spam to get this. Okay. Now, if you click the... Now, when you... Are you clicking on the activate from your spam folder, or are you moving... Yes, I am. I'm clicking on the activation. So can you move it from your spam folder to your inbox? Okay. Because sometimes if it's in your spam folder, it'll strip the links okay okay because i don't even know why this is going to my spam in the first place but it is action how you move it let me say i don't see nothing to move it not at all so i'm trying to move it and it won't let me move it to anywhere no so if you're in the gmail app you should be able to like if you're in the email I'm in here everything on the gmail nothing says move that's a thing either near term labeled Does it give you the option to report not spam while you're in the email? Yeah, hold up. You want me to do that? Report not spam? Yep, because that will move it to your inbox as well. There you go. I just moved it. Okay, let's go over there and see what happens now. Go to, okay. But where did it go? Ah! Because it didn't move it. in your inbox. Oh, shoot. I said report to spam. That's wrong, right? Not to report to spam is what I said not to do. Okay, so it's going the right way. But why is it not so we would have... Oh, there we go. I see it now. All of them. So now that's what it was. Perfect. Got it. Oh, my God. It took us all day. Now I need to make up a password is what they're trying to tell me? Yep. Yeah, that'll just be what you use to log into the app. So whatever password you want. So anything that's sitting over in the spam, that's why I was doing it. It won't let you touch it. Yeah, the spam will strip the links out of it. Got you. Save. Now I can try to look. Now it says put your password in. I'm there. Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yep, not a problem. You have yourself a great rest of the day. You too. Thank you. It was driving me crazy. It was driving me crazy. Thank you. Have a good weekend. Bye-bye. You too. Bye....
