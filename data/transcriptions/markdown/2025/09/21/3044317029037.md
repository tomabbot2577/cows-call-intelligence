## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Oh, hey, Garrett. This is Gary Dorn from CoreWealth. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Hey, quick question. So I don't know if you guys rolled out a new, you know, whatever the tool that uploads from LinkedIn. I'm trying to blank on it. The capture tool. Capture tool. Yeah. You're aware the address or the city and state are reversed? Right. Yeah. We did get a couple of reports of that since we updated the tool this morning. So our development team is working on that. I'm going to open up a ticket just so I have your name. I'll reach out to you as soon as they do push an update for that. I'll keep you in the loop. But they are already working on it, so it should be soon here in the next day or so. Yeah. I figured you guys are aware of it. It's not a huge problem, but it's just like, oh, that's weird. All of a sudden cities and states are reversed. But reversed. Yeah. Yeah. So the other question that kind of prompted me thinking was so. There's some places where I don't know the geography that well. And for example, if I'm looking in San Jose, California, I may have somebody entered in a community that's near San Jose, but I don't necessarily recognize it. there's no way within PC Recruiter to sort of say, hey, near San Jose or within 10 miles of San Jose. I just want to double check. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we could do that. It's called a radius, zip code radius search. It's under advanced search. Let me walk you through that really quick here. Let me open up your data. Which database are you in right now? Corwell. Okay, Corwell search. What's your username? G-A-D. Excellent. So, yeah, if you just want to start by going to name in the main menu at the top and then clicking the advanced search tab. In that first dropdown under the, it's under the search params heading. There's one that says predefined fields. You can switch that over to zip code radius. And then there's a little icon, like a crosshairs icon. click on that and you could either enter the zip code if you know it or you can select city underneath that location field and you can put in San Jose comma CA and it should appear as an option in the drop-down and then yeah and to the rate of that there's a yeah it'll be I don't know why it does it did it five times for me too that's funny but the radius it can be up to a hundred miles in the next field and then just hit search and it'll come back with all of the zip codes within that radius around that city. I just hit accept selected items and continue at the top of that list and it'll become part of your advanced search criteria. It'll be a row in there so you can include that and then add in other rows of search criteria. Or just hit search if I wanted to see. Yeah, yeah, or the search at the top right the magnifying glass will warn that search. Oh perfect. Oh and even tells you how far. Excellent. God I just like there's no way in the world they'd have this but you do. Excellent. Perfect. Yep. Yeah to mess around with that let me know if any questions come up but yeah definitely a cool tool to use when searching for sure. Yeah because it's like I sometimes I'll just like have to get a map out and go shit how many little towns are there that may have people listed or else I'll just sort cities alphabetically and just kind of go. But it's just a waste of time. So this is much better. Awesome. Yeah. Cool. All right. Appreciate it. No problem. I'll reach out whenever we get the city state switch kind of fixed on the capital there. Appreciate it. All right. Thanks....
