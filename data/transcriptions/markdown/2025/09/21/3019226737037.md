## 💬 Full Transcript

 Edna Rice, Executive Recruiter. This is Amy. How may I help you? Hi, Amy. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hi, Jim. I'm doing okay. How are you? I'm all right. Got your voicemail yesterday. Thought I'd give you a quick call back to give you a little information on the AI suite, the trial of the search, and all the other AI pieces that you have at trial. If you wanted to add that, it is just $5 per user per month. No additional setup or anything. It just bumps you up by $5 per user per month. Okay. And it would give you all four pieces. So the search, the email generator, the candidate summary generator, and the job description generator. And the trial is set to end the end of the summer. I would say check back with me by Labor Day if you haven't heard anything. So I would say check back up by Labor Day and let me know if it's yay or nay, and then we can take it off if you don't want to keep it. They might even have a way to shut it off automatically if we don't hear from you. So there's little chance they're just going to start billing you without talking to you. Okay, okay. I figured we would probably get an email about it, you know, like the trial's about to end, get back with your, you know, your, I don't know what y'all are called, your rep before, you know, before this date. But I just wanted to check for sure because the only thing that we're thinking we would possibly use is the AI search. The other things are not something that our recruiters are wanting to use. so that's why I wanted to know kind of the price so we would know if you know we have XYZ users and this is how much it more it would be so we could let that and Edna know before she has to make that decision yeah yeah so that's what it is just let me know and we'll touch base the end of the summer okay sounds good thanks so much Jim for calling me back my pleasure thank you you too bye now...
