## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hey, this is Luke. Hey, Luke, it's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Jim, hey, how's it going? Not bad, not bad. I had you down for a demo of the sequencing today, and I dialed in and you didn't, so I thought I'd try and reach you, see if it still worked, or if you need to push that, or what. Yeah, yeah, let me – sorry, I kind of was running late from something and kind of just getting back into the office here. If you still have time, could we do in like five minutes? Yeah, let me know. I will dial back into the meeting in a couple minutes, and we'll reconnect then. So in like five minutes, I'll be back in. Okay, thank you. All right, very well. Talk to you in a minute. Thanks, bye. Bye....
