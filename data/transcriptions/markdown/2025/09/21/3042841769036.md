## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I think I might have wound up in the wrong spot. I was trying to get in touch with William, and I think I may have gone through the wrong dial tree. Oh. I don't have a connection to William. I could pass you along to my supervisor, Nick Braddock. He might be able to get you his direct phone number. Who should I say is calling? Oh, yeah. My name is Mike Garland. I'm with Rumble Advertising Center. We could potentially be a resource for you guys for advertising, just as being another channel for it. All right. Sounds good. All right. Let me I'll transfer you over to my supervisor. His name is Nick. He might be able to answer some questions for you. And then ultimately, he could probably get you over to William, our owner. So let me transfer you to Nick now. One second. All right. Yes, I'm transferring you over to Nick and just reach out if you have any other questions. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks....
