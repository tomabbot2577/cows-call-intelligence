## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon, this is Jim. Hey, how you doing, Jim? This is Brent Simon from NextGen Support Staffing. Yeah, I think you inquired into our website the other day. Yes, sir, I did. How's everything going? Not too bad, not too bad. How's it with you? Everything's going good. I can't complain. It's a Friday, so we know the weekend's coming up. I just wanted to inquire about DC Recruiter. I run the director of NextGen Support Staffing, so it's a staff recruitment company. And basically, I'm looking to partner with DC Recruiter to do some split recruitment. is there a possibility that you offer split recruitment services? We unfortunately don't. We offer a software to track your interviews and your candidates and everything, but we don't have any candidates or do any splits or anything of that nature. Okay, okay. Okay, because basically I was going over through chat CPT, looking up some split recruitment companies, And I think chat GPT, either chat GPT or Google referenced PC Recruiter. But I didn't notice that PC Recruiter was a CRM, so I just went and just tried to pick the initiative to contact you guys and see if you could basically build a rapport and split recruitment. But to me, that is a CRM. And it's kind of like it's related, but not exactly what I need at the moment. Yeah. You're using something else? You don't need anything right now? Yeah. Basically, I use Notion as a CRM. But right now, what I really need right now is just a company to help me with some split recruitment. If you happen to know any companies that do offer split recruitment services, I would be willing to get that information. The only one I know of, Top Echelon, I don't know if you're familiar with them. They have a network that you can join, and they offer splits within that network. So that might be one that I've heard of that maybe is worth a try, Top Echelon. Great. I appreciate that. I definitely did speak to one of the salesmen at Top Echelon, and I do have an interview set up with them on Wednesday, if I'm not mistaken. So, yeah, thank you for putting me in that direction. It's just more clarity that they're well-credited, and they have credibility, so I appreciate that. No problem. No problem. Yeah, but I won't take too much of your time. And if I do run into anybody that is looking to FCRM, I'll be sure to send them over your way. Please do. I'd appreciate it. And if you're ever in the market yourself, give me a call anytime. Thank you, sir. Have a great day. You as well. Thank you. Take care. All right. Bye-bye....
