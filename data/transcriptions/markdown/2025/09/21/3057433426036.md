## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Name Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Donnie and Kelly. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. You helped train me. Yeah, I took a little bit of a leave of absence, but just came back recently. Oh, cool. Well, welcome back. Well, hey, question, and maybe you need to tell me, you may not be the person I need to talk to, but I was just trying to dial through and find somebody to talk to. I think I have put a need to talk to somebody about billing because I put my monthly bill on auto pay. They charged me twice this month in August. Deducted from my credit card on the 9th and the 18th. So I don't know. Do I need to email somebody or do I need to talk to somebody? What I can do, our person that does the accounting is out of the office for today and tomorrow. Oh, okay. What I can do is transfer you to Robin's voicemail, and then when she's back, she can give you a call. Robin. Okay, cool. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. Welcome back. Thank you. All right. I'm going to transfer you over in three, two, one. Thank you....
