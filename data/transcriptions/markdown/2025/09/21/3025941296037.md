## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MWork Search, an industry leader in engineering and manufacturing recruitment since 2010. For Cliff Rusnak, press 101. Thank you for calling Cliff. Hello, Cliff Rusnak. Hey, Cliff, this is Jason calling from Main Sequence Technologies. I got your voicemail, and I just wanted to follow up with you. Yeah, Jason, I appreciate the follow-up. So I'm using RingCentral, and it's integrated with PCR. And I know RingCentral has changed sort of their version of the app. and the text so the the app that i use in ring central is different from sort of like the the version i'm using when i'm responding to taxes or sending taxes sort of through pcr so i'll click on the name record i'll click on the cell phone it'll go into a text screen that pops up from ring central and that's like an older version is that still the right version or did they change that too. Do you know? It might just be a display window. As long as it's functioning properly, I wouldn't think there would be any kind of concern. Because it might just be a display. Okay. Alright. Do you know if there's any way I could figure that out? Because it's... The other window sort of gives me everything. This one just gives me the texting. Like, texting numbers, texting history, and so forth. I might need to look at exactly what we're talking about. Do you have time for a screen share? Yeah. And I can show you both of them. Okay. So go ahead and open RingCentral and go to video. RingCentral.com or? The RingCentral app on your computer. Oh, okay. Hold on. I got to figure out how to open that now. Here it is. Okay. Okay. Give me a second. All right, it's loading up. Okay. All right, I'm in there now. You're going to go to video and then join? Where is video at? Let's see. So which, is it under home or is it under like? You might have a newer version of the RingCentral app, but mine's on the left side. It says like a tab for video. Yeah, I got home users, phone system, AI, meetings, maybe meetings. Yeah, try meetings. Let's see, meetings, recording, webinars, meeting rooms. Gosh, more. There's nothing that says like join a meeting or anything like that. At home now. No, not across like the drive-downs. Try meeting rooms. Meetings. Yeah, I haven't seen the New Ring Central app, so I'm not sure how to navigate it. I'm not sure if I even have a new one. I don't know. That's not why I called. So it's got recording management, meetings, but under meetings, there's nothing. Webinars, rooms. Oh, rooms, okay. Meeting setting, webbing, webinars, downloads, reports, AI, phone system. I don't see video anywhere. I'm sort of clicking on everything. Yeah, I'm just going to email you a direct link to the meeting. That might just be easier. C. Rusnak at mworkssearch.com? Yeah. Okay. You don't want me to go to conference, do you? I see conference. I don't think so. Try this. I'm going to email this to you and just use that link to go in. Let me know when it's there. I'll sort of go take a look for it. Yeah, I got it sent over to you. You did? All right. Maybe it's in Outlook quicker. Let's see. There it is, Jason. All right. So I just click on that one. Okay. All right, I clicked on it. Joining meeting now. Still not opening up. All right, here it is. Maybe it's coming now. All right, here it goes. Okay, it's sort of like loading up. Okay. there we go and you can continue without audio just skip through that and then there's that share button down at the bottom just make sure you share your entire screen share share screen how do I know which screen it'll okay so I'm going to show you I got three screens so I'm going to show you the first one which is the one I'm using it's the one from ring central new one okay so that's this one you can see everything is in there like message video phone text yeah the screen isn't shared yet try you have to click on that and then hit the blue share button okay all right so now you should see it yeah so this is like this is what my ring central looks like is this like a newer version of the older version i think this is a new version because the logo has the r in a square and i was told by ring central the r in a square logo is the new version so this has everything on it so if i want to transcribe a call or or make a call using a soft phone i use this um now i'll show you the one i'm using or or I just move it over. I don't even have to change it. So you should see another screen now. You see that one? Yeah, I can see this. If I click on a phone number in a PCR name record, this pops up. And this is the logo with a circle and a phone in it, not an R and a square. so I was told the circle logo is the old one and the square is the new one but when I click on text and PCR it doesn't go into that new screen it goes into this one okay I'm wondering if that's supposed to be that way or if I just don't have it set up right um are the texts syncing between the two meaning the other RingCentral. Yeah, and the other version, can you s...
