## 💬 Full Transcript

 Eric Lutschko. Hi, this is here with Main Sequence Technology. I have a missed call from a computer. We have in trouble with PCR. Yeah, hold on a minute. I am. So I changed computers and had a lady help me out earlier. And so I got my data capture set from the top in the right hand corner. and when I go to my app, I pull up my PC Recruiter regular. And the database is EJH Consulting. By the way, I'm Eric Poletko, EJH Consulting. I'm going to count with you. And then my user is Eric, and I know my password. So when I open that up and I cut and paste, once I open it, I copy and put over on that icon so it's not found. So I go into my password management. And, you know, I've got like five accounts for whatever reason. I had an employee one time. So let me take you through this real quick. Sure. I'll just double check. I can see usernames, but not password. Okay, yeah, your username for sure is E-R-I-C. Okay, excellent. Okay. I'm going to open it up. Okay. By the way, I keep getting this. Don't show this guide for the future. I keep looking at it. It's been coming on for like five years. I hit skip, whatever that window is. That's beside the point. Oh, okay. Are you opening this in the browser in Outlook? No, I'm opening it up in the browser. Oh, gotcha. Okay. Yeah, it's in the browser. Good. Okay. Yeah, there was a password-related issue with Outlook last month, so I just wanted to make sure it wasn't that, but we're good there. Okay. So I'm going to copy this. So where I am, I'm at basic search. So up in the browser, it says Google Lens is where I'm at. Is that telling you anything? I'm not sure. Actually, we could jump on a screen share if that helps at all. Yeah, I'd rather do that. Yeah, exactly. Why don't we just do that? Okay, perfect. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings.ringcentral? Meetings.ringcentral.com. And meetings is plural. So meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. Your ID? And let me know when it asks for ID. Okay, good. That is 339-451-245. Okay. Your name? It says, welcome to Lettering Central Videos. Awesome. Yeah. Just put in a name there. It'll just show up on the screen. That's all. Cool. I see you joined. And then if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Okay. You're Garrett. Yep, that's me. So let me show you what I do, and then you can reverse whatever you think is the problem. So I go over here. Oh, actually, you'll have to click the blue share button first at the bottom of the RingCentral meeting. oh okay sorry sorry and then choose your entire screen at the top if it lets you okay and says and also share a systems audio I don't really want to do that it but it won't allow me to share. So if you click on the entire screen, you'll probably have to click on screen one to highlight it. Oh, here it is. Yeah, exactly. Here we go. Okay. Perfect. Now I can see that. Here I am. All right. So this is why I'm cutting and pasting. Okay. Is that correct? That's right. Yeah, that should be used to get into the other tools. so then I go okay there and then she said just paste over that right yeah if you select all or you can backspace what's there currently either way oh it looks like it was pasted a few times okay yeah so just hold down the delete button clear out from left to right that's what it was okay I've done this okay okay now you can paste over top of that kind of grayed out text that's just a placeholder there we go log in and then we'll put a PCR username okay I know my password is correct because it's I've seen it on my double check I don't care else. Yeah, that password. Let me check here. Yeah. I think I know what that is. Just double I can't remember if my first letters can't cop cap it's right here well here's a men admin here's as a girl East work for me here's me so all right good that's what I thought You could just hit log in because it does have your one in there. Yeah, excellent. Okay, now there's no database. I'll hit log in. Here's what happens every time. Oh, there is a database. Go ahead and use that dropdown to select your database. Okay. Oh, there it is. There we go. I've done that. All right. It might have been that when you copied and pasted over the web address, and it got pasted in twice, I think might have been the issue. But, yeah, that looks good. That's all good? Yeah, those websites can be all toggled on by default, so you're in good shape. As long as basic mode at the bottom right is turned off into the left, which it is by default, so that's good. Okay. Let me go ahead and do that. Yeah, let me test it. Okay, let's see if I can update him. Okay, and then there it is popping up. And just select his name. Perfect. Review. All right, well, then I got them. I'll put them in a roll-up. So, wherever that is. So, it should be a little bit lower where you add note. I think below that, you should have the option to – okay, is that it? So, we'll add in the roll-up to your ...
