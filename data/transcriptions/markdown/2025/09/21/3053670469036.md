## 💬 Full Transcript

 Yo. Yo. Hey, did you get that last one I sent? What did it say? Test from Tyler. Test from Tyler, no. No. You would have also... Or wait, did you send it in my database? Yeah. That means you sent to my cell phone, 856-5482. Yeah. I have not received that, no. And also, well, did you send it with my username so it'd be through my Spring Central account? Yeah. Yeah, I don't have that up on my screen. It's not... I wonder if, like, old setups work and if new setups are broken or something. Well, I noticed, too, that your... your international settings for your phone were set to Europe. so I threw the plus one into the cell phone field for you for your cell phone let me try adding myself here where's that set at international settings under the username admin like the international tab No, so if you go to system. Oh, in the system. Yeah. International settings. You have your phone formatting to follow currency settings, which you have set to Euro. All right, well, hold on. Let me check this customer database, because I'm just trying to recreate a customer. They have USD. Okay. All right, yeah. I had to do a lot of currency testing, so I have that. All right, I changed that back to USD. Now, I noticed your database doesn't have the activity box pop up. Oh, hold on. Hold on. Ha, found it. Your user preference was set to mobile and not RingCentral. Okay, I freaking totally forgot about that. Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know. It wasn't until the activity box that I noticed it. Dial using mobile, dial using RingCentral. Yeah, I switched it for you. So if you go to the gear icon on the very top right and then go to user preferences in that other section, there's the dial using. I would check that for the customer, too. This customer doesn't even have that screen. They don't even have the option to set that. Here, I'll screenshot it. you can glean exactly who and where this is too from the URL and the username Oh interesting Marlena with trans direct USA pop in and take a look I'm gonna try again here okay I get the phone dialer message mobile sending through okay I got it sweet thank you holy smokes oh why is pcr so convoluted you got to go to different screens to set up bring I know right okay so the user was Marlena Marlene yeah yeah the Peggy O doesn't have that screen either Peggy O says it's working for her I wonder if if it's their security preference. What do you mean, like the username's system admin security? Yeah. Well, I have a different one that it's working, or she claims that it's... Maybe, actually, you know what? Maybe she didn't claim that it's working. She just didn't say it's not working for her. Maybe she doesn't use it. But anyway, the system admin full permission doesn't even have that screen. Is that like a... Is there like a serial code? God, I hate the serial codes in this freaking system so much. Serial number? Is there like a ring? Is there a ring? They have ring central. like are the texts just not pushing over at all or they get like an error um let me all right so have you logged into marlania trans direct usa Yes. Alright, try and just send a McKenzie police. It's a name record. And you can see like she has her ring central connected. Her phone number doesn't belong to Stenship. Test to McKenzie to test. Okay, that was Robin. Thank you. the sender is not correctly associated with the extension from which the SMS is being initiated. Company number, oh they might have set up their main company number not like their direct dial number. because who was the other one that couldn't spend um one second let me i'm sorry i'm trying to respond to support uh i wish i could be like never mind all right we're good thank you all right uh sorry let me go back i'm logged in as marlenia you said they might have set up their okay let me know they're all different numbers yeah peggy o is like the the admin i log in as um she says it's like works for her doesn't say it's not working for her i don't know if she actually uses that but She's got a 192023400800 number. Yeah, that is a different number. She's got the right RingCentral app selected. All right, well, let me see if at least now that it's sending with me in my database, the real thing I'm trying to test is an automation from a legacy pipeline. So I'm trying to send that now. Where did I? I think it's at phase one. Yeah, I would just ask them to get a screenshot of their RingCentral profile so you can see what numbers they have set. It's like the direct dial and all that. So I'm going to insert a link to my legacy pipeline. I'm going to the pipeline. I'm adding a name to the stage one. Select. Save. Sending a name to the stage will trigger the following automation. form letter, send SMS. Okay. Oh, man. Yeah, I'm not getting either one now. I was getting the email before. What the heck, man? I'm so tired of VCR man me too anything that Mike, Brian, or Chris Salem work on is like barely hanging on they work on all the most important stuff and it'...
