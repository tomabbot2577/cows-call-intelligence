## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hello, Jim. Hello, David. How are you? I'm doing well. I am much better technologically today. It's actually working for me. So happy to show you around a little bit. So did you have any initial questions, areas of interest? I was going to give you kind of a general walkthrough just to show you the basics. But any initial questions up front? No initial questions. I suppose with the information we just gathered from dimensional search, we just want to know how that is uploaded. And then how do we leverage that information going forward for the recruiting process? Perfect. Yeah, let me show you kind of a quick tour of some of the basics in here. So what they will do is Dimensional Search will upload some data. I think you have data and they'll upload it into the database. So that data is going to populate your PC Recruiter. So the PC recruiter database is going to look a little bit like this. So it is not going to look identical to mine because like I said, they have some specific templates that they give you. They have some different information that they include in there and they might have some different screen views, but essentially it's going to be the same. So you're going to have, kind of your database here would have a primary navigation bar at the top. The middle area is going to be for searching, search results and lists, and the lower portion is going to be for the actual records. So you would be able to, once they load your data, you are going to have the ability to go within the system and you could go in and for example you could look at company data and you could type in a company name here or even if you just left it empty, you'd be able to hit search and you're going to have a list of company data. Perhaps companies you're going to be reaching out to market for, get positions with. So you're going to be able to look at all the different companies in here. And if you click on a specific company, it's going to show up in the bottom frame. So this will give you the ability to keep a running list at the top, looking at specific records down below. And you can redesign this screen. I don't know if they have a preferred design. They might give you the ability to add your own fields or make it in three columns like you see here or five or four or whatever and then okay connected to each company is going to be some names so those might be kind of the contact person at that company and then if and when you get a job a job that you're looking to fill positions can be connected to the job as well so once you're in there and you have a mature database you're going to be able to go through and look at a company like I have then delay industries here and I can scroll down and see I have a number of job openings there and maybe a number of contacts over there as well so I'm going to be able to see all my contacts and all my jobs now you're also going to have the ability to you're going to be able to pull in names candidates so if you have a group of candidates that you're bringing in those can be parsed in from a spreadsheet brought in from zoom info or hire easy there's even a little app here that you get where you can pull people in from LinkedIn career Builder, Facebook, Zoom Info, a bunch of different sites. So if I have to be looking at, if I'm looking at someone's LinkedIn, I can click a little add to PC Recruiter button. It'll create a record for them right inside of PC Recruiter. Then you're going to have the capacity to go ahead and do a search. You can hit this advanced up here and you can do a search. So if you went like sales and marketing, it could be anything you're looking at. I just don't have a lot of sales and marketing people in this database. But if you do that search, that's going to show me that I have All these people in my database, 1,500-some people in my database, have one or more of those words I searched for. And then that small column over there to the far left, that's showing you that the system found the words sales and or marketing in their resume, their notes, keyword tags, summary, profile, and attachments. So that person had the word many different times, many places. What's even cooler is if you click on any of that. So if you click on the R for resume, it's going to show that person's resume in the bottom frame. It's going to highlight every keyword. So it's going to help you to search your database to find the correct match for the positions you're looking to fill. And then what you can do is I can always go right under the person's name. That will let me get access to their record. If I want to email them, I've got their email address in here. I can just hit the little button at the end of that. I can send an email. You can preload an email signature in ther...
