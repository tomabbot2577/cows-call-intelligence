## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me Antigones Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Oh, yeah. Hey, Garrett. This is Annie from Triumph Staffing. Joe Dispoto is having problems with, you know, when he adds a new position, everything is not how it used to be. Like, we used to have perm fees and offerings on the one column with the fee. and his has changed. So I don't know what to tell him. I mean, I don't know how he can fix it. I was wondering if you can do a screenshot with him if I get him on the line. Yeah. Does he have admin permissions? No, no. Okay. Okay. So yeah, there's two ways to remedy it. He can go in and manually change his record layout to include the fields he wants to see or an admin user can copy one user's layout over to his username's layout. If somebody has it the way it should look. Yeah, well, do you want to come into my computer and then we can figure it out? Sure, yeah. Yeah, no problem. Let me start up a screen share here. All right, yeah. just go to a new tab go to meetings that ring central.com what's the ID ID is seven five eight seven four one six six six Awesome. And if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Awesome. I can see that. All right. So do you know of a username who has the correct set of fields? That would be me. Perfect. Okay. So you can go up to System in the main menu up at the top. And then on the left, go to Users. That's the first. It's the top one there. There we go. Users, and then Copy User Settings on the right. In the left panel at the top left there's a drop down it says admin right now switch that to your username. Okay and then the heading below that that says name company position records you want to check the box next to position in the first column. So that'll copy the position record layout. And then on the right, go ahead and select the username that you want to copy your position record layout to. Perfect. Hit save. Yep. And that user will probably have to log out of PCR and log back in to see those changes. Okay. Hold on. Let's get him on the phone just in case. Okay. Hold on. Hey, Joe, Garrett's on the line with us from PCR. Do us a favor, log out of PCR, log back in, and then pretend you're doing another position, okay? Okay. It should be okay now. One second, I'll take care of that. Sorry, it's loading. Okay. No, it's still messed up. Huh? Garrett? Right. So are you seeing the same thing that Annie's seeing? There's a layout that she had on her position records that we just copied over to your position record layout. No, what I'm seeing is the record layout that I sent to her because I wasn't seeing her layout. The layout that she sent me was the one that was normally the layout I've had for however long we've had you guys. and then for some reason today's layout is completely different. Garrett, could you do me a favor? Take a screenshot of this and then we'll get you to log into Joe's PCR. Okay. Let me take a screenshot here. Let's figure it out. This is what it's supposed to look like. Okay. Got it. So, yeah, have Joe just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Go ahead, Joe. This is meeting ID or personal link, can you? Awesome. Yeah, the meeting ID is 758-741-666. Okay. Enter my name, so just put my name? Yeah. Perfect. If it asks about joining with audio, if you can hear me all right on the phone, that's fine. We could just say continue without audio. Yeah, but there's also a camera, which we don't need, right? Right, yeah. You could just hit allow on anything and then just mute the camera if it turns on. That's fine. But basically we'll just need you to click on the blue share button down at the bottom and then select your entire screen up at the top. And you said don't join audio by computer, correct? Right, that's fine. Yeah, we can just use the audio over the phone. Audio, okay. I'm in, so I see Annie's screen. Okay, yeah, just click the blue share button down at the bottom of the RingCentral meeting and select entire screen up at the top. Okay. Awesome. I hit enter. Oh, yeah, just click on screen one or, you know, whatever screen you want to highlight it and select it, and then hit share. Okay. Hold on. Let me make sure I do that. Okay. So I'm going to hit screen one, share. Awesome. I can see that. All right, go ahead and jump back to PC Recruiter. And let's see. So we've got position details, record information. Yeah, it does look a little different still. Go ahead and close this out. I'm going to just repeat those steps, Annie, with your permission to try to copy those again from your username. Is that all right? Yeah. All right. And which database are you in? Triumph. Okay, yeah, let's go to... Joe, if you click on an old one, not the one that you put in today, does it look the same? So, yeah, that's the thing. When I went back into the job I created, that's where I found the percentage. But when I went to create the job, it's not even there. when I went back into the job ...
