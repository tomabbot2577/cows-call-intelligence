## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I need to get some technical support. My PC recruiter email is not working properly. Okay. We can take a look at that. Are you with the GBR Smith Group? That's correct, yes. Okay. Let me open up your database here. What's your username in PCR? PCR, just a second. Let me just move that. I think it's GBR Smith. Oh, yeah. That came up here as one of the options. So let me do that. GBR Smith. And then I will check your email connection here. And I have a password, too, for PCR login if you need that. No, that's all right. I just need the... And I can read the error message here if you want me to read that. Okay, yeah, I just did the testing, and it says domain spoofing prohibited 551. Let me check on that. Domain spoofing, yeah, this just says PC recruiter could not connect to your outgoing email server. Right. So if you go to system in the main menu, kind of at the top center, or wait, actually, on your view, you would probably have to click the three horizontal lines at the top center to see more options in the main menu. I see. Oh, go ahead. I was trying to send an email message, and that's where I got the error message. In the upper right-hand corner, there's three horizontal dots. Is that what you're referring to? Where it says settings? It would be kind of in the main menu of PCR up at the top by the PCR logo at the far top left. Okay. So, yeah, if you're on the main PCR screen and you have your main menu, things like MyPCR, company position up at the top there. There should be three horizontal lines at the end of that main menu so that you can get to the system menu option. Right. So I just clicked on PC Recruiter. It's got my login. I'm at the login page. Okay, yeah. log into PCR and let me know when you're viewing the main PCR page. So log in. So, what I'm looking at now is PCR. left-hand corner it just says you know my PCR right click on your company company or the person role as name yeah in that main menu on the far right is three horizontal lines yeah next to schedule click on that it'll give you more main menu options and you want system once like that one it's on the right okay yes I have system there it is perfect and let's see on the left scroll down to you see email setup about the sixth or seventh option down okay click on that yep email setup and then on the right click on email alias list email alias list got it and then in the bottom frame click on the pencil icon next to your email alias okay this is loading and then it has this edit edit alias and it's got my email got my address in her dress and so in that server okay okay yeah it looks like yeah that server is missing a port number possibly so who's your provider says very oh let me look up very very SMP settings let's see I did hit I've I was trying to think what might have caused this. I'm having, redoing my website, and I've allowed, but the guy that's the company, the individual who's redoing the website, I allowed him to enter Vario. I gave him my Vario login name and password. Could that have caused, could that possibly have caused this? maybe if you changed with the password changed at all that would have to be readjusted okay yeah I don't know I am not sure okay so yeah it looks like George at GBO Smith comm SMT p.vario calm and with SSL they want the port number to be 465, so let me adjust that. Let's try this. Let's have you, do you know your password for your email address? Oh, the one they're asking for here, the SMTP password? Yeah, that would just be your email address password when you're going to Vario to open up your inbox or to access your email whatever password you enter there would be your SMTP password I would maybe just try re-entering that okay I would have the Vario yeah I have the Vario password name and password. I would try re-entering that Vario password into the SMTP password field here. Because the SMTP password is a long, it must be 15, it's disguised of course. Can I change that then you're saying that SMTP password? Yeah, you could backspace that and just re-enter your Vario email password there. Okay. Let me do that right now. So I've got a Vario login name, G-B-R-S-M-I, and then I've got a password. Let me try that. um so if let me think here so the vario if your login isn't an email address um then that might not be the right username and password we need at vario whatever your um email address and then the password associated with that email address should be entered here. You could try, maybe Vario just lets you put in a username rather than an email, and then the password will be the same either way. We could try that. So should I try this? I've got a Vario username, G-B-R-S-M-I. Should I try that? Don't change the username where it says SMTP username. Keep that as your email address on this screen. But the SMTP password, do you have a password associated with Vario? Yes. Yeah, I do. Okay. I would ...
