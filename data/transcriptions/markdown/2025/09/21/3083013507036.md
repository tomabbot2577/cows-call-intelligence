## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hello, Robin. This is Kurt. It's been a little while since I've spoken to you. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I have a question. I was trying to load an updated resume under a profile. Okay. And it keeps telling me that it was successfully loaded, followed by an error message that says that it's a duplicate. Oh. Do you happen to have it already under attachments on that record? Oh, I went into the record thinking, you know, troubleshooting this myself, and there are no attachment saves because I cleared it out, thinking, well, maybe that's the reason. So I've got, I can give you the name record or let's, maybe we'll get specific here. So let me know when you're in my database. The other thing that I've found, sometimes it's on a different record for some reason. So every unique file has like a CRC number. And what it means is that number is identified as being in the database. So it might just be on a record. Sometimes just like renaming it or maybe make it an extra. I did that too. I renamed the file on my desktop and then tried to go grab it and save it. I mean, short of taking the guy's name off, I took off, like, you know, the city he was in. Oh, that's unique, I didn't know. What's, like, the person's address? Their address is? It's, like, something unique that would probably only be in their resume. Well, his address is 15 Stonewall, one word, Stonewall Way, W-A-Y. That's probably unique. and that's in New Hampshire. Coming up, but you have keyword version two. So, okay. Not in the resume. It's probably an attachment somewhere. Yeah, maybe you got put in the wrong spot by me. But if I'm trying to save it under a different person, why would the system traffic top me into not letting me do that? Probably because of that CRC number. Can you send me the resume that you're trying to do? Okay. That'd be super helpful. Hang on a second. Let me get to my Outlook here. Write new email. And what's your email again? robin, R-O-B-I-N, at mainsequence.net. I just noticed in the file name I double-dotted something, but I don't think that's any different. That might. I put his last name and then it's dot dot. Try changing that. I'm that possibly could be throwing something off let me see if that works resume upload select well still says VV Rick Dax Cola that Doc's uploaded successfully then it says error duplicate resume detected but under his name record there are no nothing in resume or attachments so that's what's got me scratching my head here it's a mystery Downloads, where do I see that? Downloads. Oh. Rename. Okay, let me write some scripts maybe. What's that? I'm going to try running some script here and see if I can figure out maybe what would I be looking for? I'm going to try throwing it under attachments and see what happens. Saving it as an attachment and going through that. I just want to see if it kind of does it there too. okay that let me upload it okay and I took it off there okay do you ever have this person in your debt room maybe that's not it I'm thinking out loud I looked I looked to see if there was a duplicate record and there wasn't I was thinking the same thing so I'm gonna go probably smaller database of mine see how I want to write this script see if I the table I need to look in it's pretty extensive trying to get an example here Okay, we're description or file underscore name. Thank you. permission. Thank you. Thank you. So basically somewhere in the system there's a saying there's a file that we can't load on it, this individual's record, even though it's a different record that it may be tucked away under or are we thinking it's possibly buried in this guy's record somewhere that won't allow me to load it again it's one of two things right yeah and usually if you go through and like modify like make some changes it kind of makes it like a a new file yeah that's just kind of weird can we do a screen share what's that yeah i can do that sure do you have ring central by any chance? I think I do, yep. Central meetings. Okay. Open that up and click join. Robin, I can't hear you. I don't know if you moved your headset or something. Okay, sorry about that. Open up your meeting app and select join. I can't hear you. can you hear me now you okay no you can hear me now uh super silent it's like you went into soft mode i wonder if i hit my headset yeah now it's a little better okay oh bam there you are oh sorry enter the meeting id is what okay is it better now the volume oh yeah i had to turn it actually so I think I my headset has a court it's not cordless so there's a little pot in the middle and I think I leaned up against my desk I'm so sorry about that okay zero five zero three nine four eight one zero I'm really kind of stumped on this one usually I've invalid so let's try it again join a meeting 0 5 0 0 5 0 3 9 4 4 8 1 0 8 not coming up okay it's maybe I'm hitting there's missing a space or something so one mor...
