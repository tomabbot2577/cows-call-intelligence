## 💬 Full Transcript

 This call is being recorded. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hi, Jillian. This is Robin Mantoni. Hey, Robin. How's it going? Oh, pretty good. I am so sorry. My daughter moved into Ohio State the other day, but she broke her laptop. Oh, no. Yes, my son kind of – she had it sitting on her bed. My son went to the room, sat down on it, cracked the screen. And so we had to take it to the microcenter to get it fixed. She had to leave for school without it, but she's got a friend moving in today. So we were, like, hoping to get it – Disaster. Yeah, hoping to get it done in time where she could take it to her. And, yeah, they got it fixed, but the touchscreen still isn't working. so she's got one more friend living tomorrow so oh yeah fingers crossed they get their first first year first year or second year second year that's awesome yeah nice um kind of bittersweet right like get them out of the house but miss them oh no it's so hard yeah it's so hard yeah and my son's at well he's at school too but he's i mean he's at a different school so it's like We go from chaos, you know, to nobody home being empty nesters. It's a little adjusting. Absolutely. I totally get it. Nice. Hey, I appreciate the call and the information. Yeah, I checked everything. I didn't see a charge. I was like, wait a minute. Yeah. Well, it's so weird because with the way QuickBooks, I guess, used to be, They didn't really have like an auto pay. So what they used to do for customers is you send like a sales receipt and it would process card, but it really does just like emailing you receipt. So it looks like paid. Yeah. And which is one of the reasons why we went into Uber. I was like, yeah, it's good. Like, yeah, you know. Yeah. It's just kind of like, you know, I was trying to explain to somebody because we have this bookkeeper now that's doing consulting. She's the one that like noticed it. And she's like, there's no card process. is just and i'm like but it says paid she's like if you look in this area it never attempted the card the card was saved but there was like literally like one extra check box you had it select for it to do that so there's you know with 1500 customers there's like six or seven where that unfortunately happened too so one of us made a mistake yeah yeah yeah no worries um yeah totally makes sense. Do you know how many users you were billing for at that time? Let's see. Let me check on these. How do we have a chat? I think it was billing us at six, if I'm not incorrect. I don't know if it was more than that. Okay, so these were all the $312.90 price. Okay, so let me look into one of these. These have been in sales receipts. What's the date of one of these? Okay. The $312.90 price was when you were at six users. Got it. And then it looks like more recently they're lower. Let's see. In July, you were at... I changed. Yeah. and July. Reason being is like we've parsed down our users starting in October and November like we even went down to four free users in November and then kind of continued with that and now we're down to essentially three. The reason I bring this up is like now it's coming to my attention. Now I'm like going back and like, oh, well, I didn't even update that. Yeah, we didn't get noticed. Like right now, like I was saying, your most recent invoice looks like it was for four users. Yep. We have one, two, three. That fourth, I guess we got to keep that fourth. so yeah we went down to four yeah it looks like you run from six to four and we always do like a ticket for user change requests because we can't rely what's on in the database because some people like api users or so yeah exactly you have to let us know when um yeah changes so it looks like that was done so that moved down in in february because we had to let some people go and yada yada and then We have gone through an interesting six months. Yeah, it looks like we did a user change request from you June 24th that went from six to four. Yeah. And so I don't know from the get-go if the billing is completely accurate. But it was one thing I wanted to bring to your attention. uh the other thing i didn't i didn't know if you had my pre received my previous email on uh kind of thoughts and suggestions on pcrm um it's gotten it's made a lot of progress a lot um some areas are still pcr8 looking where they haven't been redesigned um basically in times more where it's more streamlined and it's not yeah like things are more consistent easier to get to um yeah you know as you know pcr has a ton of features and just making everything more streamlined um but yeah it's made a lot of progress we definitely have some people on there some screens are still um we call it uh like pcr like i think like the schedule is still pcr 9 like that kind of screen um yeah but like you're searching it's got what's called simple sequencing and advanced sequencing. So instead of using like roll-up stages, you actually can do more like, in a roll-up you could do...
