You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. I'm just going to go ahead and do that. Thank you. Good morning. Stacey, do you hear me? I can hear you. Can you hear me? I do. I do. Excellent. Yeah, you too. Okay. We have one more joining us? Yeah, DJ should be happening here. Awesome. Okay. Thank you. trouble getting on or what but you There he is. Okay. Can you hear me? Yeah. I can hear you. Jim, are you still there? I am. Okay. We're all here. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah. So, I wanted to kind of follow up. So, you're leaving SRA? We are. Yeah. 731. So we need to have that. Talk about our rates and where that leads us. Our current rate is $50 a month per user. And obviously we'd like to be able to stay at that same rate, especially being as we've been customers since 2021. For sure. For sure. well the um so yeah so obviously we we can't keep you at 50 because that's that's a discounted rate for sra and it's a three-year agreement and everything of that nature um but i'm going to do something to not have to the list price for what you're looking at on a one-year term is 115 per user per month uh so are you looking to kind of keep a two or three-year term what what were you thinking or go a shorter term I don't DJ do you have an answer to that no um for I would assume that we're not jumping shit to another service so um longer terms are okay yeah certainly certainly yeah well we we'd love to keep you uh and generally outside we don't usually do a three-year term outside of SRA so that was kind of how they bought that down so low by going with a longer term I have a couple of options for you kind of usually discounted rates I could if you want to go with like a one-year term I could probably get that at just 75 per user per month if you want to commit to a two-year term I could do 65 per user per month so just a $15 per user increase on that for a two-year commitment there I really can't go I certainly can't be at 50 and I can't go any lower than 65 really being that the list price on the white 15 and why is it that you only do a three-year with SRA that was negotiated through our owners and them years ago we had never done a three-year term for anyone before but I think that SRA wanted to get it to that $50 mark for the premium package so they were able they said if we can get everyone to commit for three years would you do 50 so that's literally the only people who get a three-year term is SRA for that $50. And that's not even on our priceless. We don't normally do a three-year term for anyone there. Okay. Yeah, it's wildly low. I don't think we make any money on it. It's a wildly low thing. It barely covers costs to do that. So that's why we Okay, gotcha. Okay. So prior to 731, we want to get a number, yeah. Yeah, we need to get a new contract in place. So just a new contract signed for however many users. Okay. So like I said, I could do one year at 75, two year at 65. and you're on premium I couldn't throw in the AI features as well in that normally they're an upgrade extra but I could include them at that as well so that'll come to no setup yes okay right no one no one time setup at all I think would change right yeah yeah okay yeah and your your URL does have sra in it but that doesn't really matter. We don't need to change that because nobody sees that, but your people who have it in their favorites and log in. So that wouldn't change. Your database name is Bridger Group, so that wouldn't change. Yeah, nothing would change. There's nothing proprietary you have that you need to get rid of. You don't have to leave or get rid of any features or templates or anything like that. So nothing would change and you don't have to leave us. So yeah, just the contract and pricing. And you're not even, you're Bridger Group, you're not an SRA-related name, so we would just pull you out of the affiliate issue with them in our lists here. Okay. All right. DJ, do you have any questions? I don't think I do. That pretty much explains everything. No, that pretty much explained everything. I mean, that shows. So, with the new potential price, you're basically stating an increase of $7,200 a year. if we use 40 people. An increase of, what did you say, how much a year? $7,200. And were you looking to pay monthly or pay annually? Had you given any thought to that? It looks like you were invoiced monthly now. A lot of times we'll do another 5% off of totals if you paid annually. And that just jogged my memory. So if you wanted to do like a two-year, pay it annually for the whole year, we knock 5% off of the total on the monthlies. So that might be a little bit more savings if you wanted to pay annually rather than monthly. I think that. How does that change when we have new people or lose people? generally what they'll do is if you add someone th...
