## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? I'm sorry. Did he get the name? McKenzie. McKenzie, how you doing? This is Warren Sharp. I got a new, I got a new crop top and I've got to get BCR installed in the inhaler and anything else I need. and I got that email, whatever the hell that email thing is that you guys have. I'm trying to think of what it's called. I don't know. In Outlook? It kind of works with Outlook. Right, the portal? Yeah, that's it. Yep. Sure. Okay. Give me a sec, Warren. I was wrapping something up right when you called, and this seems like it's going to take a bit. You want to call me back? No, just give me like 30 seconds if you don't mind. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something. I was in the middle of doing it. Yeah, go ahead. Okay, hit save on that. And I just need to add a little note on this notepad here. Make ticket for adding a user. So that's good. All right. All right, Warren, let's do it. There's going to be a bunch of stuff we've got to do, it seems like. Setting up a whole new laptop. All right. So are you on the laptop right now? Yes, sir. Good. Step one. And that would be probably a good time to start a screen share. So if you could open up a browser and go to meet.google.com for me, and I'll give you a code to enter in, and you can join my meeting. page.google.com Yep. Okay. Video calls with anyone. Okay. Yeah, in the center of the screen-ish, you should see a box to enter in a code or nickname. Yep. All right, I'm going to give you a 10-letter code to enter. Are you ready? Yes. All right, I don't know. All right, I have my phonetic alphabet in case we need it. All right, so we have B as in Bravo. M as in Mike. And then another M as in Mike. And then a B as in Bravo again. S-O-G as in golf, S-C as in Charlie, and then D as in Delta. And that should be 10 letters. B-M-M-B-S-O-G-S-C-D. And click join. And when you do join, mute yourself because I don't need to hear you twice. And you can hide your camera as well. Okay. So continue without microphone and camera. Yeah. Yeah, because we just need the screen share capability of it. Okay. It should ask me to let you into the – there you go. I see you there. I'm letting you in. And then on your end, you're going to want to go to the bottom of the Google Meet, and there's a share screen option at the bottom. When you click share screen, make sure to go to the entire screen tab so I can see things more than just, like, the tab you're on. Pick whatever screen you're looking at, and I'll be able to see that after you click share. Chrome tab. chrome tab no you want to go to the right of that where it says entire screen I'll only be able to see the one window which is I'm going to need to be able to see more how come it's not how come it doesn't have a thing for share you haven't clicked what you're sharing yet there will be multiple screens my bad it's all right i'm bad so now uh make sure to keep this open um you can minimize it you could also hit the little hide button in the um bottom of the there's like a little me.google.com is sharing your screen you can hide that so it's not in your way um and you could minimize the tab if you like i think it's your mouse is hovering yeah you can minimize that and then see the bottom it says a blue button that says stop sharing to the right of it it says hide you can hit hide so you don't accidentally click stop sharing okay alright hold on for some reason it doesn't want to go back there okay okay so you haven't done anything yet you haven't downloaded any of the stuff you need yet no Okay. No, because I'm an old man, and the only thing that's going to happen is I'm going to screw something up. Sure, sure. All right. Well, oh, wait. What's that start menu? Are you a Windows machine? Looks like you are. Yeah. Your start menu looks like a shell. I don't know. I've never seen that before. well that's because the guy put a he put a thing I'm 68 years old I should have been retired 20 years ago so the guy that set up my new machine you know one of these local tech companies he I asked him to put a thing in there that it's a it's an app to make it look like the older version instead of windows 11, because I don't want to, I don't want to have to learn a whole new thing. It's just, Oh, interesting. Too crazy. Well, that's cool. Um, well we're going to go to the start menu in the bottom left. Okay. And I just kind of want to see the programs and features. Um, we're going to install a couple of things here. We got to install the launcher. I think you mentioned the inhaler, the portal. So I just want to see the list of things you have installed just in case one of those is already installed. So in the start, try and search out programs, just the word program. Yeah, I already did. Oh, okay. Programs and features, one of those options there. Yep. Can you see it? um it might be lagging or something like that i'm not really seeing much movement okay tha...
