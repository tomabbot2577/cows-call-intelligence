 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi there. I am hoping to speak with someone that can help me change my payment method for auto pay. And I tried to reach out to accounting, but wasn't able to connect with anyone. Okay. I'll try sending you over there now. One second. I'll go to Robin, as head of accounting. One second. Okay, it went straight to voicemail. She must already be on a call or a meeting. Let me send you over to her voicemail, and I'll also leave a note on her desk that you were trying to reach out. Is this Alex with Talent Strategies? Yes, it is. Okay, perfect. I'll leave a note that you were trying to reach out, and I can also send you right to her voicemail. Her name is Robin. She's head of Bill and everything, so she should get back to you ASAP. Awesome. Thank you. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Thank you. Have a good one. Thank you. Thank you.
