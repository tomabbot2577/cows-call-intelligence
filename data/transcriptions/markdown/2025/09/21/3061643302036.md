## 💬 Full Transcript

 We're calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Rob Peston calling. I hope you're doing well. I need a little help with one of my contractors. Yeah. I'm trying to do a reminder to fill out this week's timesheet. Mm-hmm. and it should be automatic didn't it I haven't had a problem with her this is her fourth week yeah who's the Kimberly Angler E-N-G-L-E-R I don't know if you can go into the database but I could go look at it period ending the 24th hours yeah okay so it started on the 11th. She did 39 and she needs to get a reminder email to complete those hours. She just texted me asking for it. The only timesheet I'm seeing for the week of the 24th? She should be able to go into the app and go fill it out without me having to do anything, right? Yeah, because, well, the status is saying it's already approved. Got it. So I need to change that, go back to approvals and put in process? Yes. So, okay, because what happened was it was getting approved weekly, so then it closes it out. So now I change it to in process. I'll just tell her to check the app now. So if the approver approves that week, it closes it out and she can't get back in. So you can also adjust it to where your pay period is weekly. Yeah, but she's getting... we're paying her bi-weekly. Okay. So we left it as bi-weekly, but you think we should just change to weekly? Or just have her submit both weeks at the same time and get it approved all at once. Got it. Yeah, because we're billing the client weekly and we're paying her bi-weekly. So I'll just leave it as bi-weekly. So I just need to go in there when I go into approvals and take that out and save it. Yeah, if you change it to in process, she'll be able to then go into the app and do the hours. But yeah, that's why she wouldn't get the email is because it says the status is approved. Let me just call her real quick with you on the line. Hold on one second. And then I can actually send her a reminder. How do I do the reminder again? If I click her, select her, and then I go to email, bulk email. Nope, you don't even have to do that. Once you're on that hours screen where you see her, like the timesheet hours, if you go into that options menu, you'll see a remind contractors option. you wish to remind all contractors with no timesheet okay no reminders oh she has a timesheet hold on let me take a look at that that's only with no timesheet yeah you could do just like the action email then if she has a timesheet that's just like in process except if I go to bulk mail is that what I have to do yeah you could do the you could select her and then go to letter letter and then reminder to submit your timesheet yep okay reminder to submit category category yeah the category doesn't really matter all that much for this one well I think that it makes you pick a category though it does but the options there are a little limited same with the email category invalid campaign name reminder and then categories. So just pick any of these, it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah, this is going to get a little complicated if we have 100 of them out there, you know? I don't know how many people use your platform for their contractors. Do you have quite a bit? That's about 50-50. Yeah. Okay. Well, hopefully she got it. Appreciate your help. Thank you. Not a problem. Have a great day. All right. See you....
