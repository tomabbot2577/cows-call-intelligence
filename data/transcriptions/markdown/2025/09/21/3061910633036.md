## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a note here that you're having trouble logging into PCR. Mm-hmm. So I looked over your login attempts. It looks like you're using multiple IP addresses. Are you utilizing VPN to log into PCR or the Internet? No. No. What does that mean? Is somebody stealing my stuff then? Because I don't know why I'm using multiple IP addresses. Okay. Sometimes that would mean somebody has a VPN on, and the purpose of those is to switch between IP addresses on like a 10-minute cycle. It could be that you are using multiple devices to sign in. No. Okay. I am not sure then why you have multiple IP addresses trying to log in. Are you using a Mac? Nope. HP is just a Windows. Okay. Okay. Does your – do you have a virus scanning software that's on that might be putting in a VPN without you knowing? I definitely have a virus scanning software, but I don't think it would throw VPN in. Okay. Yeah, I think it's the multiple IP addresses that is logging you out. Whenever your IP address gets switched, since PCR is session-based, it will log you out. and just looking at the history of logins, it's bouncing between two IP addresses. What I can do on my end is I can put those two IP addresses into your whitelisted IP keys for the time, and that would maybe fix the issue of you getting logged out. But if somehow your computer is switching from one IP, continue to log you out. That makes sense. Yep. Okay, let me maybe whitelist those. You want me to try that first? Yeah, let's just hop in. I don't know. I mean, is that a security risk issue or something? So if I whitelist these two IPs that are showing up next to your username with login attempts, that would mean that anybody with that IP would be able to log in, but they would still need a username and password. And it looks like it's the AJ username that these IP addresses are associated with. Yeah, I guess I'm just, you know, this is the first time this happened, and, you know, the whole multiple IP addresses, I mean, could that be somebody trying to hack into my computer? I'm not sure. I don't really know. It is just the same two IP addresses that it balances between. So I have like date and time stamps, for example. Go back to maybe the beginning of the beginning of the day. So 822, 1048 a.m. You're on the IP address that starts with the number 24 and then 1059. you logged in with the one starting with 96 so it jumps between a IP address of 24 IP address 96 one minute later you're back to the 24 1101 96 11 17 24 or so it's kind of bouncing between them with login attempts so must have been all the times you kept getting kicked off and then re-logging in. Okay. All right. Okay. Do you have Starlink as an internet service provider? I think I had one other customer complain about Starlink switching their IP address. No, I mean, I was at a Panera, so I was working remotely. Oh, they might be switching your IP address. since you're on their Wi-Fi. That's probably what it was. If you still have that issue after logging in from, like, a normal Internet connection, let us know. But it might have been that you were at Panera. That kind of makes sense now that you're saying that. Okay. All right, well, I'll try and check. I'll check into it from my normal spot when I get there. Sounds great. All right, yeah, let us know if you have more trouble, and have a great rest of your day. All right, thank you so much. Bye-bye....
