## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Brian Testa. Hey, Brian. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, Jim. How's everything going? Not bad. Not bad. Wanted to give a call. I got your email yesterday talking about the AI suite. and wanted to see what you needed because it shouldn't really look grossly different. Oh, yeah. The AI suite as opposed to not. Let me just see real quick. Pull it up. Okay. Okay, here we go. So they sent me a link. and let's just see. I log into that and yeah, I mean, it looks like so like I go to roll up list. I mean, it looks completely different than the normal PCR. Like I go to roll-ups. I mean, it looks a lot different. Let me take a look here. Yeah, it should look just like it does. There should be no impact. Can you do a screen share real quick? Let me take a look here. Let me see what they sent you even because you were doing a trial of the AI. Yeah. Let me take a look here. I just sent you the link that they sent me. Yeah. I want to see what they sent because it shouldn't have changed anything. That's why I'm not sure like you're still the same PC recruiter. The only thing it would do would be add little AI buttons to a couple of screens. So there shouldn't be anything hugely different. Let me see if I get that here. Okay, let's see what we get here. Oh, well, they weren't supposed to do that. Somehow they set you up on PCRM. They gave you the whole wrong thing. What is PCRM? PCRM is our new product. It is a CRM product that runs off the same database as PCRecruiter. It's a whole new interface, but it's also going to add a deals pipeline, a simpler sequencing piece, and stuff like that. So, yeah, you weren't supposed to get that because we didn't talk about it or anything like that. I was like, what is this? I was like, I have no idea what I'm looking at. Yeah, the only thing that you would notice, so if you log into your existing PC Recruiter database, the AI should be there. And it's now going to be, I think it's going to be under a little AI button. If you go to any email screen, so go to send an email screen out of PC Recruiter. And any one of those screens is going to have this icon. Okay, all right. So I'm going to go send an email. Okay, perfect. And on the screen at the top, there should be in the far right of all the buttons and the text adjustments and everything like that, there should be a little blue and purple PC Recruiter logo. No, I'm not seeing anything. Surely, you wouldn't have done the wrong thing. So let's try another one. Let's go into any candidate's record. Go to the summary button, if you would. see so the summary button at the top of the screen okay so I'm on candidates and okay so I'm going to candidates profile right now is that what you're looking yep and go to the summary button or summary tab rather all right and then And you see how there's like the bold, italic, underline, all the paragraph buttons and all of that stuff at the top of the summary screen? Oh, yeah. Now I see. On this one, I have the AI generator on it. Yep. I didn't have that one on the – so that symbol should be on the emails as well when I go send it? Let me see. It might be kicked down to a second line now that I think about it because depending on – let me go into mine. It might be kicked down to the – yes, kicked down to the second line. It's at the end of the second line. Oh, I see it. I see it. There it is. Okay, so if you click that, this one pops up a little thing where you can say what it wants your tone to be, what's this email going to be, and it'll generate it that way. The other one, you just click it in the summary, it'll generate a summary. If you click it again, it'll regenerate. So that's the only thing you should have noticed as far as the AI trial, but I guess you're getting a PCRM trial too, which is something you didn't ask for. But yeah, if you want to log around and take a look at that, that is our new interface slash PCRM, our CRM product. It is something that you could add to your existing PC recruiter if you felt you needed the deals pipeline or even if you just like the look of it better. Okay, so now just real quick, so like I'm on, you know, I'm sending an email out to a candidate. So now do I write an email and then click AI generator? No, click AI, start with AI generator and then the first thing that pops up, you click, you want it to be formal, casual, friendly, instructive, you pick one of those. What's the general purpose? Then you pick kind of a general purpose, follow-up, negotiation, schedule, interview, whatever. And then it's going to kind of generate something in general. And then you can hit the regenerate button or down at the bottom where it says your response here, you can add mention the sales job. Let them know next Tuesday is good for me, stuff like that. And it will kind of integrate that similar to like ChatGPT works. Okay. All right. Cool. Perfect. So I'll play around with this and then I'll get back to you next week...
