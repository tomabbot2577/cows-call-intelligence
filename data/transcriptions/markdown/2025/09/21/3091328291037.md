## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, this is Jim. Hi, Jim. Hello, Carrie, how are you? I'm doing well. How are you? I am all right. I'm all right. Thanks for joining me today. I wanted to talk with you a little bit about PC Recruiter and kind of answer any questions you have, outline what the onboarding process looks like and kind of take you from there to talk a little bit more about things have you seen a piece you recruit you kind of saw it I have yes it is kind of what comes with with your purchase of the dimensional search franchise so that is kind of part of what you get are you in the October 6th training class yes okay and is it just going to be you or you're going to have more than one user? Just me. Okay, one user for now. Perfect, perfect. So, so what happens usually on today's call, what I will do is I will collect your, your company name and street address and contact information to email you over the paperwork. That'll come through in like a DocuSign style format. It's called PandaDoc, just a different brand name of a DocuSign. And that is going to be the paperwork for PC Recruiter. Once that is signed, my, I will countersign it and then I'll have my accounting team send you over the invoice for the setup in the first month. So to recap the pricing for PCRecruiter, the setup is $750. That's a one-time cost and that is going to be what's going to include creation of the database link. It also includes 10 hours of training and assistance in solving integrations with RingCentral, HireEZ, ZoomInfo, any of those those other packages that you want to work with. So we kind of include all of that up front. So the nice part about that is you have a bunch of training here with PC Recruiter. So you have our team training you and you also have the whole team at Dimensional Search training you. So what usually will happen is once we get everything signed, paid, and the database link is created, we would have a trainer assigned here on our end. And that trainer would get in touch with you and I and they have kind of an initial call, like an intro call, and they would schedule two hours of training prior to the 6th of October. So you get a couple hours under your belt to do the basic setup, kind of get familiar with the system, et cetera, prior to going to the training at Dimensional Search. And then after that, you go have a little bit of training at Dimensional Search. They will build on your knowledge, and then they'll kind of hand you back over to PC Recruiter, and you kind of bounce back and forth like that with both teams training you playing off one another. And they have a whole involved process every step of the way. So they will kind of work with you that way to get you up and running on the system. Our team will kind of concentrate a little bit more on utilizing the system and the basics of how to use PC Recruiter. They will delve much more into the recruiting and just the general training on what you're doing and everything. Okay. Okay. So if you have no questions, what is your company name and your street address, phone number, all that good stuff? I do have one question about the price. You said it was a $750 one-time fee. but then what is is there an additional like fee for the month or for the year to use it there is I don't know I forgot to even mention that it's $50 a month so $750 one time setup fee and then it's $50 a month from there forward so it's $800 to get it set up just the first month and the setup I apologize I left that out when I first was mentioning that yeah Okay.
