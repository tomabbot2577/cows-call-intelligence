## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, Brian Doherty. How are you? Hey, how are you? Good, good, good. So you not only collect my money, but you do customer support as well? Yes. There you go. All right, so last week, after 14 years, I got a new computer, and my cybersecurity company, Project IMC, helped transfer everything over. and I've got the icon here for PCR capture, but it's asking me to log back in. It's asking me to enter my PCR site URL. I assume that's the thing that shows up at the top when I log into PCR? Yeah, it'll be that address that starts with www.pcrecruiter.net, and then it ends in, like, ODBC. Yeah, if you copy that link and paste that in. Yeah, and I did that, and I log in. but then it asked for my user now is the username and password the one I use to get into PCR correct okay so I use that but it's not recognizing it I mean it gets me in PCR but it's not recognizing it on p-star capture something is wrong okay so what did you put in for the username the initials BD and capital letters. Okay. Make sure that username is right. Okay, so the link that you used ends in odbc.broadviewheights, right? Yeah, and then after it's got default, size, whatever. It's funny, I haven't been at SB Broadview Heights for nine years, but it doesn't matter. You know, if you change the name of it, then it causes a whole bunch of issues. It's almost like driving. Yeah, computers. External links then become broken. Okay, user login. Let's see. So your username looks like it's BD. Yeah. Then it probably means that the password is wrong. Do you normally just sign in, like, with a saved password? Yeah, I have used this Keeper cybersecurity thing. I don't even know my passwords. I mean, they're like 20 letters long. and it automatically populates it. I mean, when I say I don't know it, I can find it. I can see what it is if I go look for it, but I don't normally know what any of my passwords are. Yeah. Can you go into that to see what it saved, what normally gets you in? Because that's the password that the capture would also be looking for. Yeah, let me leave PCR and let me see if when I go in it, if I can actually see it. Because you only have one database called default database and your username is BD, so it has to be something with a password. All right, so here is show more. How about show me the damn password? There we go. Okay, so it is the password that I have. Yeah, it's the password that I think it is. But the funny thing is I can't paste it into the PCR capture spot. Let me try it again. It won't let you. Ah, this time. Let's see. This time it pasted. What kind of bullshit is that, Robin? All right. Now I entered my username. Let's see if it gets me in. Nope. Incorrect username, password, or database. Oh, so under database. Wait a minute. Did you pick a database? I have to select default database. All right. That's what the problem is. Hang on. Hang on. Now we'll try it. Yep. to capture. Yep. And all these things are off. So wait a minute. Do I have to reset these things? Well, you don't want basic mode on. Definitely do not want that on. Okay. So it says, it's got LinkedIn.com, LinkedIn Recruiter, LinkedIn Recruiter Lite, LinkedIn Sales. Turn them all on. Turn them all on so that they're blue. Okay. Even the ones I don't use? Well, I mean, anything with LinkedIn, I would leave that. All right. So LinkedIn Sales. All right. What else is down here? Oh, leave them blue, you said. Oh, wait a minute. They were blue. Hang on a minute. They were all blue. Leave all the LinkedIn ones on because sometimes even the different accounts. Yeah, like Facebook, if you don't want it on for there, that's fine. All right. So they're all on. And then the bottom, it's got basic mode, dark mode, capture to default company. Nothing is on down there. Perfect. So basic mode, if it was up to me, I'd take it out. But some people want it. That's when you don't get any review screen. kind of just adds and goes um so i just review it so you definitely want basic mode off now the capture the default company if you like to get their company when you're pulling them in then turn that option off if i like to get their company turn that option off well the option is off okay all right so i am supposedly good to go what's this button up here top match what's that match like if you're in certain areas of LinkedIn it'll show you an icon next to their name if we think that person is already in your database all right okay so that should be working so now when we get into it let's go see what candidate you know yep it's working all right Robin do you use some on miraculously showed me the light I think the whole issue was it said database but but I didn't click and get the default database. I think that's what the problem was. Yeah, that's the first one I think you've got to pick that. You know what? Technology. I wish I was 25 or 30 maybe because you grew up on this stuff. I'm not even close to that age anymore. My ...
