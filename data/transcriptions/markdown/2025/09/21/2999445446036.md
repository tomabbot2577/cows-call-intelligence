## 💬 Full Transcript

 Robin. What's up? My favorite co-worker. Pickings are slim now, huh? There's only eight of us, so you've been promoted. I win by default. So I have a unique situation here. Barry Smith, he is the guy that closed down an IT building and he went over and moved into his new organization they split the database yada yada the NIT account was getting counts canceled as of the end of this month but the bill went through the other day he got an email on Friday I think that said he was out by 525 you didn't because I didn't put it in yet because we were still moving data so what do we do because obviously it's going to be closed I'm putting in the ticket right now so it's going to be closed. So what was it? NIT building? Yeah, NIT building. Is it his card? I think it is. Which actually might work because he also, he currently has another company that maybe could we just extend the credit to that other company to cover it for the next payment? Well, here's what I'm wondering. If it's his card just to keep it simple. Were they canceling this one? Like now. Because they both there's no early termination because even though they're under contract until August, they replace both with two new agreements and it's just as many users just in a different configuration. This one's next date is July 27th. I'm going to, so with your ticket created as a cancellation that they're just going to be created as a new customer name or whatever, I'm going to delete the recurring and for NIT building, right? Yep. And then put canceled, what's today, 630, payday, easy to remember. Started as new customer, what's the new customer name again? Cornerstone Building Solutions and also the Z company, I think it was. So it's two new organizations, the Z group. Okay. Split and started. Okay, let me see. His new customers. And then an empty company. Okay, so this one, they paid $627,000, right? Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Now, Cornerstone is the one he's going to? Yeah, that's his new company. Cornerstone's building. what if i and did he start yet yeah they're using he's using fully a cornerstone the data's moved that's where he's using so nip what if i just what if i'd say skip next date instead of getting his next invoice on july 15th he'll get it on august 15th do you think he'll go with that yeah is it the same amount roughly oh because it's going to be because he's a cut he was five users sitting on it i think cornerstone is only three and the other guys one oh wait hold on one second yeah so it's not gonna be the same okay wait let me let me pull up both of these customers at once then okay so what I was an NIT building oh yeah one was 525 and one's 460 so what I can do is It's ask Kathy to refund. Okay, that's easiest probably, just refund. Well, that's what I'm going to tell her to do, and I don't care what she says. The Cornerstone Building, I have it as 210. Is that right? Two users at 105. Cornerstone Building Solutions. Mm-hmm. I thought it was three, but maybe it's only two users. I don't know what the receipt was. I'm looking at cornerstone building solutions is invoiced for two users two users at 105 apiece that's right so yeah so that's that so um okay so Kathy okay so put NIT building solution Need to refund 6-27-2025 payment. This customer will be closing as two people are splitting and starting on their own. They will each be billed, or they are both. They're both, yeah. They're both two separate companies now. Both now being billed as two separate companies. Yeah, I was getting that ticket in, and it just snuck up and hit, and I was like, crap, I didn't put the cancellation ticket in, so it got charged through because nobody's using NIT. I've just got to cancel it. So I can tell him we will refund that. and then I have step two of this unique situation so when you're ready let me know I'll see what you think of us splitting and starting on their own Okay, so I'm going to put a little note here. to refund 627.25 okay okay all right so what's the next one the second quirky part about this is since he moved to his new company and i did all the paperwork to set up and everything in the help desk he has has moved to his own company. So I have to put in a cancellation ticket for NIT Building Solutions. He didn't change his email address yet. So I can't put it under his name. So should I just put it under this Rob Parkett, who's the only person remaining under NIT Building Solutions, and then just put CC a copy to Barry once this is done? Because I don't want to get confused and have someone accidentally cancel the wrong account. Hmm. So if anything, just make a second record. I don't think does it let you do that in oh I don't know it'll usually say this record already is this because you can't use the same email address oh I guess so I yeah that's what I'll put it under this Rob Park cat it is NIT I will and I'll say this is Barry he's actually the owner CC anything to this address but I just couldn't put it in because it was a duplicate in th...
