## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. I'm just calling to check on the status of a support ticket that I had submitted last week. I hadn't heard anything back yet. Okay. Hold on one second. Oh, shoot. Okay, and I'm so sorry. What is your name? My name is David Vanden Hall. I've got the ticket number okay and what's the ticket number 102 754 And minimum salary, that's a... Yeah, so they've got our client, Hanson Ag Replacement, has several custom fields. we're trying to, I mean, currently what they're having to do is basically go in and manually plug in any data that gets entered into the custom fields on the online application. And because none of that data is coming over into PCR via the API, which in looking at the API, it looks like it should, but. Yeah, I might have to have it, you know, escalate this. It is assigned to somebody, it looks like they just haven't got to it yet. But adding records or updating records, let's see. Change the questions. Let's see, developer API. This isn't really like general support stuff, this kind of developer stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. I submitted the ticket and I hadn't even gotten a response that somebody was looking at it yet. So I was just kind of curious where it was in the queue and what we can kind of expect for at least having somebody take a look at it so I can let the client know. Custom field. Custom fields. Candid ID, custom fields, field name. I don't really know my, let's see. Looks like you might need the candidate ID to go along with it. Would be my guess. Because that gets stored in a different table. Okay. Because this is on – so like when somebody registers with them, we have them fill out kind of a quick apply where it at least then creates the user inside of PCR or creates a candidate inside of PCR. So at that point, there wouldn't necessarily be a candidate ID because it's generating a new candidate inside of PCR. Yeah, I would have to have somebody with more experience on this reach out to you. I just don't know, unfortunately. Yeah, that's fine. And then I did have another general – this is more of a general question. When I'm in – I've got an admin kind of test account for the client that I can access their PCR so that we can see data coming in and out. but when I open up PCR and I go to the upper right hand corner, hit the gear icon, hit start launcher, but when I go into any of the candidate records, I'm not able to open any attachment. It kind of, there's a little link in the bottom. Do you have a Java and launcher? Do you have those on your computer? I don't. Are you on a Windows computer? Matt. Okay. I'll send you a link for it. Okay. And I'll take that ticket. So I can't follow up with you. Let's see. So with a Mac, it's a little bit different, the link that you have to get. So you can't do like the regular Java download. You have to get it from Amazon Coreto. Okay. I'm just going to sort you. I'm just going to sort you. Let me know when you get the email from me. this one will come directly from me it'll say Robin and me sequence at that got it and it doesn't have a subject line so what you'll want to do you'll want to get Java but you want to use that Amazon Coreto Java development kit to get it and then do the launcher and then the first time you go in it you'll get a prompt like do you want to open this you hit the checkbox it like always allow. If it asks you for access to your documents folder you have to hit yes or allow. I forgot how it's worded and then there's like a final check to allow an update. Oh it went into my spam there we go. I'm going to go ahead and do that. Is this a newer update that is why I've got it? Because I used to be able to open files in PC Recruiter. Well, the Java launcher, like on Mac, you'll see that it's like PCR URL that has to be running. did you kind of do like a reset of your computer get a new computer anything like that I mean were you able to do it last week no it's been sometimes I seem like when like it's a Monday ish like I call them Monday issue where people leave PCR open over the weekend and then that launch or times out Place that. Place that. Okay, so the new launcher. Okay, let me refresh my EC Recruiter login here. Yeah, so there must have been an update along the way that something didn't get updated properly on my end because now it's asking me to. Okay. Oh, now if I go to here. Oh, there it goes. Perfect. Okay. That works? That is working now. Yep. Perfect. All right. And then I will have Mackenzie follow up with you on the API question. I did sound like two. I appreciate it. I have an example. I'll be honest. I'm just not most versed in that to answer any specific questions. No, you're good. Yeah, so I'll have to get a hold of the client because I know they were having some issues. one of the gals there was having issues getting documents to open as well. So I'll get a hold of her. Yeah, now the thing is if they have – yeah, it just depends if you have Windo...
