 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Jim, how are you? I'm well, Scott. How are you? Hi. Is your camera up? Oh, you know what? No, I didn't even have it on the screen. I just dialed in. I don't even have the Zoom showing it on my screen. why don't we okay okay we'll do that i will pop that back on i think i'm getting in here now okay yeah perfect there there we go yeah i dialed in wasn't even looking at the screen i didn't have you up there or anything at all so i apologize all right yeah i'm just gonna don't mind me i'm gonna be eating my uh my lunch as we go through because you know how it works you get busier in You know, time is going to always go along. For sure. Uh-huh. What I've been doing sitting here all day, just working along. But, yeah, I think Brian was going to hop on as well. But I wanted to just kind of talk with you, see what we needed to do. I think there's a database we're converting, maybe another old PC router database we're re-spinning off or something. Well, I have an old PCR disk. I don't even remember what's on there. It's been a long time. Okay. And Brian did send me an external DVD-R drive that I need to still – Well, again, so I'm not really concerned about that one. The one I am concerned about is my database inside BigBiller. Okay. So I want to be able to take that and migrate it over. Yeah, so we can do that. So Brian talked about data conversions. He said they'll cover the cost. The BigBiller conversion, it takes, I want to say, like 60 days to get it done. we have four or five others going on right now and they run through they convert the whole database over good news is we know big bill pretty well and the guy who does our conversions very familiar with them likes them so they're they're a good one okay okay yeah that works and also i needed i need a refresher course on pcr okay yeah you've used in the past right a while back? Many years ago. Okay. And I heard not a lot. I mean, it's been updated, but I know the whole thing behind PCI was to keep it simple, not to over-indicate people with too much stuff that they're never going to use. Certainly, certainly. Did you want more of a product demo? Did you want more training? Or do you know? What were you thinking? I haven't even opened it up yet because I haven't done anything with it. So I think it's cloud-based, right? Yep. So I would say probably just a working, you know, just showing me what's there. And, you know, I mean, I pick up on these things pretty quickly, but I just want to make sure that I'm doing it the right way. For sure. For sure. Hello, Brian. With Big Biller, I can do mass email blasts and all that. I'm sure PCR has the same capabilities, I would imagine. Yep, for sure. Okay. Certainly, certainly. Okay. So what I want to do, because I know you remember Trey, who used to work for the company. Obviously, he's not there, but he used to work in higher ed, and that's my specialty. So I want to be able to get in there and see what he had going on, see what clients he worked with, When's the last time you worked with them? What kind of relationships? See what's salvageable, you know? Sure. Sure. See, so I could get you scheduled for just a plain product demo. Would you rather wait until you have your data in? What's your feeling on that? No, I like to do it sooner or not, and I want to start putting stuff over. So give me one second here. I'll go to him. Hey, Jim. Hey, Brian, how are you? Hi, Brian. Good. How are you guys doing? Pretty well. Good. How are you? Good, good, good. Give me one second, guys. I'm just replying to a meeting here. And then, Brian, we've got to make time to finish our... Yep. Did you ever plug in the DVD player so we could see the backup of that old database? I was just telling Jim, not yet, because I need to do that. I'm just getting things set up. So I'll, you know, the old PCR from, you know, 15 years ago, I'm not. We'll get that over. My biggest one to migrate is the Big Biller database. Yep. Yep. So that we can get started. Brian, I will send you the paperwork. We need an agreement signed. We can do payment paperwork, get all that done. And then get the data here. Who has the data, the backup of Big Biller? Big Biller, we don't have a backup yet. Right. Okay. okay so so we'll need to get a backup from them and upload it to you guys perfect so yeah we can do get paperwork going and that once that that's all ready you'll work with my keys he was the one who you work with to get the data and he'll go through everything like that and I told her that it'll take 60 days ish to get done good news is Mike is real familiar with the bill and he loves him so he likes that product he works very well with it he really converts them pretty well and we do it quite a bit so that's good yeah so that That will be action item one.
