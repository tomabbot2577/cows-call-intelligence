## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Erica Stern. I have been trying to figure out how to link my email to my PCR. I believe I've done it, but I'm not getting the auto-updates on the activities tab in the way I expected. So I'm wondering how I can fix that. Let's see. hold on one I was and I'm so sorry what is your name again Erica Stern S-T-E-R-N E-R-N okay Erica's with a C that's right E-R-I-C-A-S-T-E-R-N what is the company Ascend Attorney Search LLC okay let's see why don't I have you yeah we don't have you in here yet okay um let me add you in okay erica s-t-e-r-n what is your email address e stern at ascend a-s-b-e-n-d attorney search dot com okay what's your phone number just in case i get disconnected 248 505 4392 Now what did you set up for did you do portal or were you doing PCR mail? So I let me see email so I linked my Eastern, like linked my Outlook to PCR emails and settings via the configure. I watched a training video to do it. So there's like you have to set up where you can email from PCR, but as far as getting any kind of like incoming email, you would have to have either the PCR portal add-in or for Outlook, the PCR portal added for Outlook or a PCR mail setup? Do you know if you did either one of those? Or did you just go to like email setup? I just went to email setup. Okay, and you're an alias address list, I assume then? I'm so sorry. I don't know what that means. So if you were in PC Recruiter, did you only go to system, email setup, and then click email alias list? I'm assuming yes. I'm having trouble answering that. Okay. And you're, okay. I'm looking at the username. Your last name is Stern, S-T-E-R-N, right? N as in Nancy, that's right. Okay, I wrote M on mine. Okay, let's see what you did here. Let's see, Eastern is your username. Oops. You want to get, where you can send an email but also get incoming, So I couldn't write activities? Yeah. So I was under the impression that if I use my Outlook as I normally would and the email that I have associated with a candidate is the same one that I'm corresponding with via Outlook, that PCR would pick up on that and put it in the activities. Only if you set up one of the integrations. Okay. Let me see. Okay. Okay. All right. So here's what I'm going to have you do. it's very very top right a piece your recruiter there's a gear icon and it floats up on the edge of your user oh actually have part of it done hold on one second let me see hold on okay hold on hold on there's only part of it done and I'm gonna let's see why do we not have folders for you interesting why is this showing up under personal all right I'm going to delete out this setup because something's not right here and this is your main account right okay I'm going to go under mail servers and delete the setup that's there something is off with it I don't know what it's not even giving me the folders um okay let's do this you happen to have ring central by any chance um I do not I don't think okay is that something else you get while we're on the phone I'll just do a a what do you call it what's it called a google meet instead okay so let me google meet okay Sending you a meeting link. Great. Okay. I'm going to join the call. Okay. When you join, either mute or don't join by computer audio and you won't need camera because we don't need the phone. I mean, sorry, we don't need the audio because we're You're just using it for like a screen control? Yeah. I'm like literally getting an email every two minutes. Oh my gosh. I can't keep up with it. That is overwhelming. I don't know what it is about Monday. It's like a little insane here. Okay, I joined without audio or... Okay, perfect. Okay, so what I'm going to have you do is share your screen. So what you'll do is share screen, but make sure you select entire screen, which is going to be over to the right. okay sorry give me just a second it's asking to record all of this and that doesn't make sense oh that's basically how your computer words um allowing to share your screen they use the word record got it not really not really recording okay allow later.
