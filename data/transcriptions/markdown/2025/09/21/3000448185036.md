## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Susanna Fairbanks, Owens Medical Placement. I put a ticket in last night. I'm unable to send calendar invites, and I just wondered if you could help me. Sure. Let me log into your database. Are you in the IT-Tech or OMP recruiters? OMP recruiters, yes. Okay. And what's your username? Hang on, let me see what I am. S Fairbanks, I think. Hang on. I think I'm S Fairbanks. Let me just refresh and I can tell you what I am. Hang on. Reload. Hang on a sec. I am SF. S as in Sam, F as in Frank. Okay. Perfect. I'm logged in there. and so where are you in PCR when you're trying to send the requests? I am going to a position I'm going to Atlanta Massimo the company the position and I'm going to the pipeline and then I want to send a meeting invite out through the pipeline for a zoom a phone call and then when I add the step, put the date in, which is Thursday, the 3rd of July. The time is 2.30 p.m., and then I save step, and then I go to email the candidate and the hiring manager. I put the candidate's name in there. The name pops up with the email, and then it stops. On the right there it says send to where it has checkboxes where you can select the candidate rather than typing it in the to field. That might help as well. So if you're in the bottom half of that pop-up window where it says send email, you have on the right where it says send to and you have the candidate and the contact listed there with checkboxes. Yes, yes. And when I tick that checkbox, and then only half of the email address goes into the field. It's really strange. oh um yeah so i go email yeah so i'm typing the candidate's name in it goes in and then it goes straight to that box and then if i select and put a check mark then and put select in i hit select nothing happens Okay, I might be looking at something different then. Okay, so if you are at the add step pop-up window, we're still on that same window, right? Add step, okay. Go back to add step. Okay, I'm going to add step. I'm going to go to the date. Perfect. 3rd of July. I'm going to go to 2.30 p.m. Perfect. Right? And then I hit save step, correct? Right? Not yet, because I think you want to send an email at the bottom half there, right? Or no, you're not sending an email from this screen, you're sending it from a different screen. Yes, I am. I always go to save step and then I go to email. Is that right? Okay, send an email. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, bottom half of the screen, you can still send the email out this way without leaving the screen before saving steps. Oh, yes. Okay. Collect. Okay. Okay. Okay, and now I hit close, correct? Not yet. So you would choose a template of an email. Are you typing out the email on the fly or are you using a form letter that you're sending out? A template, yeah. I want to go to the template. Okay, yeah, use that dropdown to select the template. Write under send email. Okay, hang on a second. Oh, add interview type. Okay, sorry. I don't normally do it this way. Where do I normally go to select the template if I'm on the add step? I found it. I found it. I found it. Okay, I found it, hang on. Okay, phone screen, okay. I've got phone screen and now I hit save step, correct? Not yet, there's still another button for send as meeting request. Is that what you wanted to do, have this go out as a meeting request when the email was sent? Yes, it's going to be a Zoom meeting, but I don't have that template. We just do, I just do a phone screen confirmation and then I change the wording once I get to it. Oh, okay. So you don't want this one to be a meeting request, maybe a future email you want as a meeting request? Yeah, it's a, I've selected the phone screen confirmation. Oh, okay. And then I, can I hit save step and then I can change it? No, so Savestep will actually send the email immediately. Oh, okay. No, I don't want that. Yeah, if you scroll down, you'll see the actual letter typed out that you selected. Oh, I see. Yeah, got it. Okay, okay, okay. So I'm going to have to change the name a bit. Okay. So it doesn't automatically put the time in for me, does it? So if you choose a time and date up above and then you have the insert field for like, I think the insert field code is like interview appointment date, interview appointment time, are those inserted? Yeah, so they won't be visible but you will, the recipient will see those filled in based on the date and time you selected up above. Okay. Even though they're underlined in red, interview appointment time, interview appointment date. Okay. So I just need to change the wording one sec. Okay. This is a different way of doing meeting advice. I don't normally do it this way. But I'm happy to do it this way going forward. But let me just, can I just, okay, so I'm just going to change it just to say for virtual meeting. Okay. Virtual meeting details. Okay. And then Megan Honeycutt will send link ...
