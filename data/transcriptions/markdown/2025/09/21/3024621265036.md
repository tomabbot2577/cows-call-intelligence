Please stand by. you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and start the recording. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Do you hear me? Yeah. How are you? I am all right. How are you? How are you? Good. We're just setting you up in our boardroom so that everybody can see. Can you see us? I do. I do. I see you there. All right. And, yeah, a meeting assistant came in, and it was asking me to approve it, but in no way could I approve it, and now it's gone away. Oh. It got done. Okay. Well, it looks like we're good now. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, so why don't you show your round the PCRM product a little bit. I wanted to first see if you had seen it. Have you heard anything about it? Did you have any initial questions about it before I kind of go through and show you what it does and what it is? So we've only seen the promotional material that you guys have put out about it so far. That's it. So very, I guess, novice on this side. So if you could take us through a walkthrough, that would be ideal. For sure. For sure. Yeah. So I will go ahead and get myself logged into it. I'm going to share my screen here. So we're going to take a look at the PCRM product. And the PCRM product a little history about this. It was conceived a number of years ago and it was planned to be a new version, basically a new interface for PC Recruiter, PCR9, which is the PC Recruiter that you're using right now. So it was planned to be the new user interface. So we were going to migrate everyone over, kind of like we did when we did our last version from 8 to 9. But what happened is over the years that they were developing it, they were adding new features and functions they added a lot of CRM sort of functions. They added a whole sales pipeline called the deals pipeline. They added a simpler sequencing piece. So in doing so, they actually launched it as a separate product. That happened maybe April of this year, so it's pretty recent. But we've launched PCRM as a separate product, but it shares the same database as PC Recruiter. So what that means is you could actually add PCRM, and you could use both versions. They share the same database. All the integrations work because the integrations go directly to the database. And it's also going to be something that if you had some people that wanted to use PC Recruiter and others wanted to use PCRM, that's just fine because it's real-time synced. It's sharing the same database. So it queries the same database. The nice thing about the PCRM is that it's going to contain almost everything that the regular PC Recruiter has, but in a new and refreshed interface. So if I go and get myself logged in here, I'm logged into my database here, you'll see as you do notice this, it's a lot more modular as you come in. There's different widgets you can put in there, like your dashboard, for example. You can drag a number of different things just right into there. So if I wanted to look at activities or if I wanted to look at some sort of an info panel, I can kind of start moving things around and add things around, put it whichever way you'd like. We've also set it up so that rather than top to bottom, like right now PC Recruiter has the menu bar across the top and then you have a top and a bottom frame, the PCRM keeps the menu bar over on the left side. So on the left side of the screen, you're going to have your names, companies, positions, roll-ups, a lot of the same stuff that you're used to in PC Recruiter, but all of the screens, most of the screens, not all, but most of the screens have been redesigned into this new interface. So a lot of the things... Your audio is going in and out. Yeah, I'm not sure if it's from our side or yours. Is this from the other side? I think that's because the screen is working okay. Yeah. I think that the module is catching me. I'm hearing an echo as I speak. Oh, we try. Sometimes. Call them on the phone. On the phone. Let me see here. Okay. So, this is going to be the same thing on a voice call, because it will be picking up, like, if we have it on speaker, it will be picking up the sort of, like, you know, you try to have a voice conversation at blank notes. If Jim can like mute on this and he could call us, that might be... Yeah, that mute on that. Okay, we're gonna try to... Do you want to try calling us on... like if we can leave the video call on, but if you mute and try calling us on the phone, we might be able to hear you better. You can use my cell number so I can give you that whenever you're ready go ahead okay so I'm going to give you the number to call is six one three two five two three three zero one fantastic I'm going to just drop off I'm going to leave everything out here I'm going to call that number...
