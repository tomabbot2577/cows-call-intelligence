Thank you. Hi, Brent. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. I am not sure if you can hear me. I'm sorry, playing around with my headset. Give me a call back. I'm so sorry. I'm not sure what happened with the audio. I'm going to also call you from my cell phone just in case you can't hear this. Thanks, bye....
