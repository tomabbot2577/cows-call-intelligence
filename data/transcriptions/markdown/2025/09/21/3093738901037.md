## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, hey, it's Scott at Ocean. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. I'm trying to set up the email thing, and I'll come back to that in a second, for Kayla, and I'm running into a roadblock. Do you think you can help me out with this? Yeah. Are you getting an error on the email alias list, or what are you running into? We're not even at that stage yet. Okay. So what I'm actually trying to do is to set it up so that when she's looking at a name record and clicks on the email tab, that she's able to see the emails that she sent out via Outlook. Okay. So what that means is she'll need PCR mail set up. I'm going to send you instructions, but I'll talk you through it as well. Let's see. Well, so I actually received the instructions from Garrett, and don't judge me, but I spent an hour and a half trying to figure it out on my own over the past couple of days. I'm the guy that doesn't need to ask for instructions, and I tried to follow the instructions. Man, I got deep into it, so if you can just maybe take over. Do you want to do a screen share? Okay. Yeah, that would be great. Is it Scott at Ocean Medical? Kayla, this is Robin. Robin, this is Kayla. What email address should I send the meeting invite to? at C-A-I-L-A-H Wait, hold on one second. C-A-I-L-A-H Okay. at OceanMedical.net Okay. I'm generating it now. Add others. Okay. Okay, she'll be getting an email from me in just a moment. And in that email, there'll be like a click to join Google Meet option. okay all right i'm going to admit you into the meeting okay and then what i'm going to have you do is at the bottom of your meeting screen there's a share screen option it's the rectangle with the arrow pointing up when you click on that, you're going to get another pop-up window. And make sure you go over to the right where it says entire screen. And that's where you're going to want to pick which screen to show. I just want to make sure you're using entire screen. Got it. Okay. All right. So let's – we don't need to use this window. We don't want to close this meeting window. If you can go over to, like, your browser, wherever you have PC Recruiter open. Okay, so what you're going to do is at the very top right of PC Recruiter, see where it has like a gray head and shoulders icon? Okay, click that little gear icon that's just on the edge of that. Perfect. And then select email. Okay, well, it looks like we have a couple here. Okay, let's hit configure. at the top left and then click mail servers. Okay are both of these the same account? Can you click action edit on each one of those? Okay Kayla at OSHA Medical okay and then do the same. Okay so on one of those rows go to action and select delete because you don't need the same account twice okay all right what I'm going to have you do next and this is like the part where it's maybe a little confusing is you're going to go to email folders up at the top okay so these are going to be all of your folders down below that's just a listing but what we actually have to do is if you follow that email folders heading in the lower half all the way over to the right the icons that we need are in the the menu they're just not pinned so if you go to that three lined icon over at the right okay first one we're going to want to choose is set sent folder and we are going to be ignoring every we're going to ignore everything under personal we need to make sure we're under this kayla ocean email you're going to scroll all the way down near the bottom and you're going going to look for sent items and you're going to go to action, mark as sent items. The reason we have to do this step is different mail servers have different labels but we need to know what is your sent and what is your trash folder. Okay let's close out of this window and then next thing we got to do is go back to that three-lined icon menu again and this time pick set trash folder. Now this time we won't have to scroll down as far. Actually you just went past it. Up a little higher, a little bit higher. Okay right below conversation history is deleted items. You're going to go to action, Marcus trash folder. Now at this time is when it'll start the process of the sync but this initial sync might take a while. Really kind of depends how many emails are on the server so you may not see them for a couple hours but after that it's pretty quick so let's get out of here and then the next area we're going to go to is preferences up at the top and there's only one setting to change in here in the bottom half of the screen in that sidebar at the left click activities Okay, where it says write incoming emails to the activities, change that from none to from subject body. And then in the menu at the top right, again not pinned, you'll have to go in that full menu at the right and then hit save. Okay, then the last part is your settings for sending an email. We're going to go to alias address list, w...
