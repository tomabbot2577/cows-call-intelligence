## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Brian. Hey, how's it going? This is Omar. I had a quick question. I know someone from earlier helped me out, and they gave me a video on how to do mass bulk imports from Excel sheets. Yeah. Looking at this client of mine's PCR database, Whenever I go to the roll-ups tab and try to see that same icon that was presented in the video, it is not there. I was wondering, since the video is two years old, did something change when it came to doing a bulk import of names and stuff to add to a roll-up? No, nothing changed. You may not have access to it. Click on the roll-ups tab at the top. Okay. All right. All right. And when you get to that roll-ups tab, you're looking for a specific roll-up. Is that correct? Or, oh, no, the ability to import. Okay. So go to the roll-up that you're – so you have to have a roll-up to import to. Did you create the roll-up that you imported to, that you want to import to? Okay. So go to that roll-up. Okay. Okay. and at the top you see a bunch of icons with images right there pictures of icons right I see a question mark a gear and update MRI yeah okay so at the end of that should be three lines with an arrow pointing down yes hit that uh yeah still nothing still help customize update MRI okay so the user that you're logged in is does not have permission to import or export in PCR so you need to get that user you either need to log in as a user with that capability or you need to get that capability added to that user by your PCR admin okay so I am I am going to go to their database as admin. I see users. Is it under manage users? Yep. Yep, correct. Click on the username that you're logged in as. Oh, that I'm logged in as? I'm signed in as admin. Okay, so go to admin. Okay. Wait a minute. If you're logged in as admin, admin probably already has. So down below in the lower screen, you'll see information, contact, security, and other. Open up security. And then contact information. Open up contact information. And under contact information, what does it say there? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My bad. My bad. My bad. I apologize. guys. The charms on the left-hand side say information, security, preferences, international. Click on security, please. Okay, security. And then the first tab says systems administrator. Yes. Open that up. And then what does it say in that drop-down menu? Full permission. I will say I do have a problem with a separate user. I'm logged into their admin user on their database. It is a specific user that needs the permission to do that. Would I have to configure the admin permissions or would I have to configure that specific user's permission? Either do it as that admin or you log in as that person. You need to add the rights or grant it to the user. The admin has the rights. That user that you're working with does not you either add those rights to that user or do it as the admin and then present that to present the results to them okay so if i go to that user her name yeah if her if her name is logan username i click on login username i click on security and then um the tab that i would be looking for to give the permission would fall under system administrator correct or right Security, you go back to that same tab, security. Okay. And then system permission, no permission. Right. What does it say there? So hers says no permission. Right. There's a reason for that, okay? So before you change that, if you're not an owner of the company, I'm telling you you need to check with the owner of the company because that's going to give that person more than just the ability to import. It's going to turn on – they're going to have the keys to the kingdom. So I'm going to suggest you log in as admin, do what you got to do, and then present it to the person. They're going to see it the same way in a roll-up list. It doesn't matter. So do it as admin rather than changing something on that user. Does that make sense? Perfect, perfect. Yes, it does. It does. Okay. So from the admin, where would I have to go to just import this roll-up for her? I'm not following the question. You log in as admin, you import the roll-up list, and then you tell her what the name of the roll-up list is. What am I missing? So I don't have the option to import a roll-up from an Excel file. She doesn't either. Right, right, right. Yeah, so she was given the task to, she was given an Excel sheet, and she was told, all right, make a roll-up out of all these LinkedIn profiles, right, like a LinkedIn roll-up, essentially make one. She tried to do one because she tried to do one. She didn't know how to. We called the PCR support helpline the first time, and they gave us this video to do so. And upon her trying to do that, she wasn't able to because she didn't see the import button, like as was shown in the video that we received from you guys. Okay. So what was your name again? Omar. Omar. You are looking to import an Excel spreadsheet for this user, correct? She was the one who was supposed to...
