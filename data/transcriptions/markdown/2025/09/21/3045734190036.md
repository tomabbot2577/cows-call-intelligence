## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Celeste. Hello, Celeste. It's Jim with PC Recruiter calling. How are you? Good. How are you? I am pretty well. I wanted to give a call. I got an email from you. I was out last week, but I did receive an email asking about a pipeline template within PC Recruiter. I wondered if you were still looking for assistance on that or what? Yeah, so I wasn't one who was on the changeover to PC Recruiter. So, you know, I'm looking at all the tools available online to, you know, get some help and see what I'm doing and things like that. And I noticed there was like a pipeline. And our pipeline does not map out or look anything like the help tools online. So I'm not sure if it's because of the, you know, what we're subscribed to or we just have an old version. Well, I think it's mostly because you're on an old version. You're talking about the new pipeline that's like the little cards that you can drag and set up all the different colors and everything. Yeah, that is. So that's our new pipeline, and that was released some years back. But it wasn't part of a release that everybody got because what it did was it would start from that point forward. Every new position would have the new pipeline, but old positions wouldn't change. They would still be on the old pipeline. So as such, it wasn't automatically applied. Now, that being said, I could apply it to your database. I could put in a ticket that comes with an hour of training and the setup and use. But just know that any positions entered from this point forward would use that new pipeline. So you want to make sure your whole team was aware, everyone was on board, everyone knew, so nobody was drastically surprised, or maybe you already talked with them. But all you need to do is just drop me an email, and I can put in a ticket to get that underway if you want. Oh, okay. Well, let me talk to everybody because I don't know if they're aware of it. I've just been popping in and out of PCR trying to learn it. I'm not one of the recruiters. I actually do all like the office administrative, you know, business stuff. so but I can't recommend anything to the team if I don't learn it so that's what I was trying to learn it and then I saw this wonderful pipeline I said we have nothing that looks like that and that drag and drop would just be awesome I mean to me it looks so easy to use so that's a nice piece yeah so if you decide that you want to do it just pop me an email share it with the team if if you have any questions or they want to learn more about it send them my way and then just pop me an email. I'll reply to your email to me so you have my information. And then if you do want to get it turned on, just let me know and I can put in a ticket and turn it around in a couple of days. Okay. Thank you so much. I appreciate the call back. Certainly. All right. You take care. You too. Bye-bye. Bye now....
