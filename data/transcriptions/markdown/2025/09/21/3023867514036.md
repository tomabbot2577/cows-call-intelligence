## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. You have not... Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise... You are in the meeting now. There are three participants in the meeting. It's showing that my video is on, but it's not showing me. Your little slider is not closed, is it? Or you're not on the laptop camera with the lid closed? No, I've got the Logitech one, and it's open. The slider's not over it. Let me try. Let's see. It's usually when it's a full black square, it means like the camera is closed. Like the . Yeah. Oh. You know what? I'm going to log out and come right back. Sounds good. I fixed it, Chris. That did it. I don't know what it was. Yeah, sometimes a good old-fashioned leave and come back or reboot. Good morning, everybody. Good morning. So I wanted to chat with you today. I think we're going to take a look at some of the premium features of PC Recruiter that you all don't have right now. And wanted first to kind of see if anybody had heard of the premium features. Are you familiar with any of them? Do you have any particular interest in any of them? I'm going to show them all, but any initial thoughts? I'm not sure we're aware of what they are, so if you could give us a quick overview, that would be helpful. Fantastic. Fantastic. So what the premium package, so you're in the enterprise package of PC Recruiter, which is the base package of PC Recruiter. The Enterprise Package would actually add an email campaigns feature to be able to set up mass emails. There's also a nice reporting tool so you can see clicks, opens, unsubscribes, replies, kind of see the results of your mass emails. Building on that, there's also going to be a sequencing piece. So there's a sequencing of drip campaigns engine within PC Recruiter so you can build your own sequences. So you could say, send an email, pause five days, send a second email. If they maybe open that one, put them on a call list. If they don't, send them a text through RingCentral. So that is going to be included. And then also the analytics reporting that will include all of the custom reports, as well as the reporting on your email campaigns and sequences and stuff like that. And I think I might have talked with Tina once about sequencing some time back. I think that's how we eventually arrived at this. So I do want to show you just some of the things that the PC Recruiter does that might be of interest to you there. So I'm going to share my screen here. All right. And you should be looking at my sign-in screen for PC Recruiter. Do you see that all right? Yes. Fantastic. So I'm going to go ahead and get myself logged in. So the biggest thing, kind of the biggest thing you would notice, there's not any change to the look and the feel or anything like that, but the premium package adds some additional tiles up top here, sequencing, analytics, the email campaigns pieces in there as well. So the analytics kind of ties everything together. This is going to give you the ability to build custom reports within PC Recruiter based on anything relating to the pipeline activities or custom activity types. So if you wanted to look at something like pipeline activities, I've chosen to build a report here that only shows first interviews, second interviews, and phone screens. But you could include every interview step you have in your pipeline if you wish. You also, when you're pulling these reports, can go ahead and pull them for different periods. Last year, this week, last week, make a custom range. So you can kind of pick and choose what data set you want to look at in what period of time. Then once you have that data, you can also, with one click, narrow it down by job. narrow it down by client you worked with narrow it down by recruiter I only have one so it's only showing me or you can even build teams if you want so you can actually work with your data to see what's going on and this is going to be something that will allow you to build reports off of any pipeline related activity or any related activity that you might have in the system like names added companies added incoming calls email sent any number of different things so pretty much anything you can get into PC recruiter as far as activity is going to be able to be part of these reports and you can create goals and KPIs and different things in here as well these analytics are also going to contain the reporting for your email campaigns so email campaigns is a whole different section on the report and that's going to show every email campaign that you sent and it's going to show you an instant report of how many people opened it how many people clicked one or more of the links how many people replied unsubscribed or bounced and cool thing about it is if you scroll down you can actually click into see who clicked and you can see who clicked what when how many times so you can see all that information there you can also see who opened it so you can see who opened your e...
