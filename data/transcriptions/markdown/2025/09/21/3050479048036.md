## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Sonia Ippoliti calling from Princeton Legal Search Group. Haven't spoken to you guys in a while. Hope you've been doing well. Yep, doing good. How are you? I'm doing well. I have a couple of questions for you. Setting up a new user with PCR integration with Gmail integration with RingCentral. haven't done it in a while and just a couple things I'm a little shaky on wanted to confirm with you yeah so for the first thing I think this one will start with the easiest how do I make the name tab the default when he opens PCR right now I'm going to company yes so if you go to the little gear icon the top right hand corner yeah there's the user preferences yes and then there's the navigation configuration yeah and then open PCR action is to do hold sub navigation for no please where is it I know it's like what I think I figured it's an easy fix but I just didn't know where it was buried yeah I always forget where this one is ah all right click my PCR up at the top so I exit out of that menu. Yep. And then go into the options list for the MyPCR, like the stats down at the bottom right. Go to the customize option. Hold on. Am I in the configuration? Configure MyPCR? Or no? I'm under standard stats, like I'm down there. Yeah, so you'll go, there's like that options menu for it. Like above where it says like the standard stats? Am I going to the cog wheel, the little customize? Yes. Okay. And you'll see that there's that dashboard. Yeah. And so where it says startup screen. Oh, there it is. Company. And I want name. Name search. Great. Yep. All right. So where was that? That was in my PCR and then in the little, got it. The little cog wheel. Okay. Let me just jot that down because I have another user to set up to. MyPCR. Is there like an actual technical word for that? Some symbol? I would call it the cogwheel. I call it the gear icon. The gear. There you go. That's probably better than cogwheel. Okay. That's great. Thank you. um the the other question i have is so i enabled the um gmail integration um i just want to confirm the two-step verification is required right to leave on the gmail account so that's what it's the documentation says but there was at one point somebody told me otherwise i just want to make sure because it's been a while that that still holds true yes because gmail doesn't uh allow Gmail and Office 365 really don't allow simple verification anymore. Yeah. So that two-step verification is needed. Okay, great. The other piece is I know we're supposed to turn on the IMAP settings in Gmail, and that is no longer specifically there as it's shown on your documentation. so um like the toggle to turn it on is not there anymore um oh like in gmail itself yes yes yeah take a look yes i'm always the one finding these things you know yeah that i'm not are you talking about like in the admin side no no so like when the person needs to go into their gmail settings to turn on the imap um into this forwarding so they go into their settings forwarding and pop imap they have to enable IMAP. So you used to have to enable IMAP and it was a toggle. It was disabled or enabled. That is no longer there under IMAP access. Oh, yeah. So I'm pretty sure for Gmail, that's just automatically turned on now. Yeah. And I think you're right because I think most of my integration is working fine, except for one thing. I'll have to fill in my questions. But again, I just wanted to make sure that I'm not missing something. Yeah, it's automatically enabled for Gmail now. Okay, great. So you don't have to manually enable it like you used to have to do. Yep. Okay. That is great. Then let's see. So I enabled the integration and I sent a couple of test emails that are not tracking to the record. I gave it a good amount of time. I think it's been more than an hour just because I know there's a delay. Yeah, so let me do – once you have the IMAP set up in PCR mail for a user, it takes – we always tell people it can take up to 24 hours to do its first initial thing. I see so if you just set it up today check back tomorrow okay and if I set it up today and sent some test emails it will catch up so I don't have to like test it again tomorrow correct okay alright so I will I will save that for testing tomorrow and my final question is I also configured the ring central integration. And I thought I'd followed the instructions online, but when I tested a call from a quote-unquote, you know, a number that's in the system coming in to our new employee, it's not giving me the pop-up, the PCR pop-up showing who that contact is in the system. Who is the user? So the user is GK. It starts with a C. The name is GKUKA. Yes. Because you do have to allow notifications. So I do have notifications. So when the call came in, my RingCentral window popped up. The Google notifications popped up, but the RingCentral did not pop up. like just the ring central not...
