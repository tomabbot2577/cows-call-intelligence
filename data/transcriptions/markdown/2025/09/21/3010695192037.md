## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Nade Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, my name is Craig. I work for an MSP. We're supporting a client who uses your product. We have an issue where the user is trying to access a PDF that's attached to a document that's in PC Recruiter. When we go to click the attached PDF, nothing is happening. We've cleaned our browser settings, updated Adobe. We made sure our browser was up to date. Nothing is actually happening when we click on the PDF to open it. Do you guys have any note issues or anything on this? So is it a, you're opening an attachment on a name record, or is it in the mail section, the PCR mail part of the software? Let me see if she has it in the ticket here. All I know is that just from what I saw, she searches for the employee or the sender of the email or the recipient, and then she pulls up this window where she has a list of, it looks like emails, but then she navigates to the attachments section and then tries to open the attachment. I don't know if that helps at all. Yeah, so that function will need the latest Java and PCR launcher running on that computer. So those are two programs that will just kind of run in the background. So I can email you links to download the latest version of each of those, if that'll help. Or I can email it directly to the person, whichever works for you. If you wanted to send them to me, that would be amazing. So is this – I was under the impression that this was just a web portal. Is this something we need a desktop app for as well? It is all based in the cloud and the web, but we do have two programs that we install on each computer to run in the background to have things pop up in PCR, like opening attachments is one of them. So full functionality needs these two programs to be installed. Perfect. Yeah, go ahead and email me them. That would be amazing. Awesome. Okay, what's your best email address? yeah it'll be a C as in Charlie B as in Echo E as or B as in Bravo E as in Echo N as in November S as in Sierra O as in Oscar N as in November at inscnet.com net let's see net It's I-N as in Nancy, F as in Frank? S as in Sierra. Oh, sorry. Okay. I-N-S-C-net.com. Okay. Let me send that over to you now here. Okay. and that second link to that one there we go Okay, just hit send on that. All right, let's see if I have it. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, if that doesn't work after installing those, just give us a call back. We'll continue to troubleshoot, but that's usually what it is where you can't open attachments. All right, thank you. I appreciate it. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Take care. Bye....
