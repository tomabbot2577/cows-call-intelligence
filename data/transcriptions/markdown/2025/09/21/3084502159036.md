## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Robin, hello there. It's Bonnie Lewenstein with Excelsior Executive Search. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I am doing fine, but my PC recruiter has gone a bit wonky on me, and I can't figure out why. Okay. What do you mean by wonky? I love that word. I love using that word. I know, right? It's been working fine. I've had no issues. And what I went to do just now was I went to position, picked a position I'm working on. I went to the little email envelope. Okay. Then I literally tried either to search by the person's name, which I found it, but it won't select the person. Or I even tried just copy and pasting the email, and it's not letting me. Okay. Do you happen to have RingCentral? I do. Okay. That's what I'm calling you on. Perfect. Okay. So I'm going to set up a RingCentral meeting, and then I'll have you join it. Okay. I want to see what's going to – it could be, like, something like clearing cash, or we'll figure it out. Okay. So I'm going to start a meeting. So if you open up your RingCentral app, you'll go to Video, and then click Join. Video. Join. Okay. I'm going to ask you for a meeting ID, which is 050-394-810. Now, when it asks you about audio, either mute or just say don't connect with audio, because sometimes you get a little interference. I'll just connect without audio. Okay. Okay, okay, so what I'm going to have you do is click share screen down at the bottom, but where you see where it says your entire screen, make sure you're picking from that section and select what screen to show. In case you have more than one monitor. Oh, yeah, hold on. Let's go here. This one, PC recruiter, share. Okay. Okay, so you're just there. Okay, so show me what's going on. So like first I tried doing this and I search and then her name is Watson Cherie. Okay. Here she is. Okay. And then select. It's like nothing happened. So then what I did was- Let me try that myself. Let me try that myself because that'll tell me If it's something like clearing cache. Okay, so should I do it again? No, just hold on one second. I'm going to try it in my database. And that just tells me if it's like something comes to your computer. So that just tells me that way. Let's see. And when I then just said, okay, well, screw that. I'll just copy and paste the email in. And then I would hit like enter or tab, and it brings up the thing to search for the email. It's weird. Okay. I'm gonna get it because it seems to be working okay for me okay so what I'm gonna do is have you clear cache and that'll probably do it okay so let's close out of this window okay and we might need to have you sign in and all that other stuff so just bear with me but this should fix it if you go at the very top right of Chrome okay go to delete browsing data but don't do anything else once you get there until I tell you what to do. I want you to do more than you're supposed to. Okay. Uncheck browsing history, uncheck download, uncheck cookies, leave only cached images and files selected. Okay. Hit delete data. Okay. Let's have you close Chrome. So if you go up to the three vertical dots, choose exit down at the bottom okay now but oh it's stop sharing your screen can you go back to share again I'm sorry Can you still hear me? Okay, can you hear me now? Yes. Sorry, did you, like, maybe call through, like, a Chrome extension for calling? Maybe that's why we lost call. Okay. All right. We got you back. Okay. Let's hit share again because I lost the screen. You're still in the meeting, but I lost your screen share in your audio. Let's go ahead and hit share and go back to entire screen again. Okay, all right, so we're back in. Okay, give it a try now. Let's see what happens. Interesting. Okay. Okay. Let me try that again. I didn't try that part. Let me see what happens when I do that. Have you something with your browser? Mine's not doing that. Yeah. And that's what happens sometimes with things with browsers. You never know. You know what? I don't think you're showing entire screen. Can you do share again down at the bottom? But make sure you select entire screen. Okay, I'm going to ask for remote control. Okay, let's see. I'm going to go out of here for a moment. I don't want to accidentally send something at you. Any changes on your computer or anything like that? Well, you know, since it's a Windows thing, yesterday it said I'm going to update and restart. And that's what I did. Okay. I don't know what it's updating. Okay, you do have Java, and that's pretty current there. So that's good. Just trying to see if it's anything like with the Java launch or the apps that you need to have. Okay, and you have both of those. Okay, so that's fine. I wonder if I can try this. Okay. Okay, hopefully I don't lose you again. okay here to still have you try over here to you never know how personal redirects okay cooking setting this one maybe Okay, I am going to try this with my email. Oh, you must have your...
