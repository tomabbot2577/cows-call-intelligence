## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by your name. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hey there, Jim. Hello. How are you? Can you hear us okay? Yeah. Do you hear me all right? Yeah. Now we can. Excellent. Excellent. I'll pop on my screen here. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah. Good morning to you too. All right. Yeah, so thanks for joining me very much. Wanted to introduce myself and PC Recruiter. And you all are a new dimensional search office, I've gathered. And are you part of the class on the 6th of October? I think we're going to move it to November, just because there's probably not enough time to do all the application trainings we need. Sure, sure. Yeah, we, um, you would want to usually our training team will get you two sessions prior to that time. I actually talked to two other offices in the same class yesterday. So they're still getting signed and paid and everything. So they're trying to do it. But with them also trying to do it. Maybe if it's better for you, it might might make sense to switch to November. When is that class, by the way, do you know? I think it's also November 6. Okay. November 6th. Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Which means, you know, probably if your team, if your training team is preoccupied, then come post-October 6th, things should be a bit more available, right? Which would also work well because then we still have about four weeks before the November intake. Certainly. Certainly. And they like to get, I think they generally go for two sessions prior to the dimensional search training. Okay. So that should give plenty of time for that. So as you know, PC Recruit is the software that you use. It comes with dimensional search. They train on it, and essentially you'll have our whole training team and their whole training team kind of training on everything from software to recruiting to general and everything like that. So it works pretty well. What I do today is just kind of go over that general process, which you already knew that process there. I would also collect your company name, address, all of that information to put together the paperwork so I can send that to RUVU once you're ready to get moving. You can sign that with DocuSign. The initial payment is the setup, which is $750. So $750. That includes the setup, database creation, and up to 10 hours of training with a trainer. And then $50 per user per month. And are you going to be one user, two users to start? We're going to be one. We'll start out with one. If I remember correctly, there is also like an admin user in addition to the general user, right? And I think that's probably sufficient for now until we decide to grow our team. for sure yeah the admin user is there and it's it's like you like you said free of charge and it is something you can use for occasional access data entry looking and stuff like that if it gets to be that you're using regularly everyday sending emails doing interviews and something you want to add a paid user but certainly for now you can use that admin user have you used before you familiar with PC recruiter at all no both first-timers yeah so so that is Good. And like I said, so it's 50 bucks per user per month, $7.50 one time. To get set up, it's $800 to set up in the first month. Yeah. And do you have any questions? Or I'll collect your company name and address and everything so I can put that together and have that sent over. Sure. I think the company name and address and all that I replied by email. Just check my latest one because I made a typo with the company name. It should be Doctus and not Duke. Duke is a funny typo. We are also getting ready to buy laptops. And so what I wanted to know is, is PCR web hosted or does it need to be installed onto each user's laptop? And also the system requirements. I know what kind of specs are required to run the program. Sure, sure. So it is totally cloud based. So there's nothing that's really going to be installed on your laptop except for a small launch. I think they call it a launcher. So there's a small launcher, and that would be just a little like Java control pack or something like that. So not a lot at all. No data is kept on your machine or anything like that. Pretty much anything is going to run on a PC or a Mac, so that doesn't matter. Not a Chromebook. So some people want to buy a Chromebook, can't do it on a Chromebook. So that's one thing to know. And really, any computer you buy today is going to be more than enough to run it because it's all cloud-based, just like logging onto your Gmail. So it's pretty simple. So that's going to be pretty much easy there. Okay. Now, going back to the agreement that you're going to be preparing, from the time that you send it to me, is there going to be some kind of expiration date by which I should sign it? Or is it – I think 30 days. When we send it, I think by default it gives you 30 days to sign it there. Okay. Th...
