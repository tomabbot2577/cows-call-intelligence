## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, did you call my cell? I did. Oh, okay, because I hear it downstairs ringing. Oh, that was me. It was charging. I'm going to the feast today, and I'm like, I'm going to charge my phone now. It's like dying. At least it's a nice place. It's not too crazy hot. Yeah. Hold on. What? I don't know. I have to, like, see if Dee replies. Because I know we're going to go tomorrow, and we're talking about going tonight, too. but I don't know. I'll have to see what she says. Quick question for you. This email that you created, this ticket for index, it's got a tygis.com email domain. Is that still correct? Yes, his email won't change until I think September 1st or something like that. Okay. So this is like Tygis branched off and took half of their users, made them into this brand new company that Matt Dion is the head of, but they're the same building, the same people, just splitting billing and splitting it into a whole new ASP. So the next step is to make a copy of Tygis' entire database, copy it over to Index. But we need to get the link created first, but we need to have billing adjusted, like set up with him first. Okay, so I'm doing it now. I just was wondering, I'm like, oh, because we don't go to him. You know what I mean? Yeah, he's with Tygis. It's just the same company. It's just splitting another version. All right. So, famous billing address. Okay, so their number is going to be 8950. 8950? That's their QuickBooks ID. Oh, I thought, because their monthly is 5450. so I was okay so there's that part okay so now I'm gonna do where's the invoice now that's the Linda Bailey wow I'm like reading this thing I'm like what that like did she not do a demo like we did a whole demo for like an hour and a half on the phone because that was the call that was my first day back from vacation and Patsy was she's like what the heck was that because it took almost two hours and we were talking we demoed everything and then she's asking the same question she just asked I said what she doesn't know what she demoed she's like what am I gonna see this but she got hit on the head and she's a little bit wonky but like what's her I feel like spending a contract it's always something with her she's always always like oh I had this accident or this happened or it's always something with her. Well, I almost feel bad getting into a contract with her because she's clearly not right in the head. Did you see her email, like all the attachments that when she emails? Go into ticket 102-315. I was in it and I saw. Look at like her reply back. It's got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 image attachments. What are they? I don't know. One is a picture of her head. Oh, one is a picture of earrings? Like zooming. Like what the fuck is this? Oh yeah, earrings. She's strange. But she's asking about all this stuff that has nothing to do with her. upgrade. One is a picture of her office with the ceiling on the floor. Ring Central, Canley, Perplexity, or ChatGPT. Lucia. I didn't see Lucia. She needs to explain more to her, I think. We're going to have to have a whole other call. I don't know why she's mentioning all these other things. Those things, you've got to sign up and pay them. ChatGPT doesn't have anything to do with us. Neither does Lucia, she's a little wonky there. Oh, and so now that you have this deal, you could put it on our fancy spreadsheet. I can. Oh, I didn't even put it on there yet. I didn't even put it on. Did I? No, I didn't. Maybe you're waiting until it gets paid. I think I was. I always wait until it gets paid to throw it on. Which makes sense. What even is her company? Medical Recruiters. Yeah. I've got to talk to her, and we've got to have a whole other call, and she's confused. This is an enterprise ASP installation. What's the setup fee? No setup fee because they get no training. Because there's no training, there's no anything. There's no setup. it's just they'll have to start paying their 14 users at $54.50 which is $7.63 a month so they'll have to start paying that now the first month okay so should I just do a recurring to start on the 15th of each month that's reasonable yeah okay so I'm going to do new okay so yeah I'm looking at him like I don't see but he didn't really open the agreement yeah okay so should I say started on the 15th or should I started on the first realistically what do you think let's start it on the how about 20th can we do that is that a thing yeah and it won't have your price warning us enterprise package 14 users $54.50 per month, $7.63. He's in Williamsburg, Virginia, so it's out-of-state taxes. Okay, and then we will start at $8.20. The next one, say, is that Wednesday? Whatever that is. that's the day I will be out and then you have to send that to him so he can set himself up a card to get it on right okay so then once that happens should I do should I do one invoice for now and have this one start August 20th yeah because then we can at least have him pay that invoice with th...
