## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Chris W. at MedBest. How's it going? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Happy Monday. Happy Monday. Hey, I have an unusual kind of wonky thing that is going on in PCR with jobs, and I just figured it might be easier for me to call and tell you what's happening. Okay. So when we are putting through EPOs or SOs through the job in PCR, like when we link a candidate or we update the EPO or SO activity and then we hit save, PCR acts like it's not doing anything when you hit save. So people are clicking again because nothing's going on. And what's happening, Robin, is because PCR seems like it's doing nothing upon that initial click, there's duplication of the EPOs and SOs happening in the system. We used to get like a refresh or like some type of like, I forget exactly what it was, but it's not doing that on the initial click anymore. And so, like I said, we have these. I wonder if there's just like maybe database sites. What database is this? MedVest Recruiting. Yep. What username should I check? You can check You can check B. Yocum It just happened to Brianna It just happened to her So you can check B. Yocum Can I go in as admin? You have an admin username, right? Okay Yeah, yeah What's an example of a position? An example would be New Martinsville The Hill Valley, New Martinsville That's Is that a company or I'm sorry, Robin. What are you asking? I misunderstood your question. Okay. So actually, what's a person's name, a candidate name where it's happened to? Rhonda Pitsnagel. P-I-T-S, last name, N-O-G-L-E. Let's see. Okay. So I see a link name, an EPO interview, and a send out first interview. Yeah, it's all fixed, Robin. So there's no, you're not going to see anything. Everything's been fixed. Yeah. Let me see here. Okay. So I'm going to go ahead and click on the link. Let me just check how many pipeline records are. 29,000, not too bad. I expected more. I have the candidate that it just happened with, but same thing, Rob and Bree already fixed it. Okay. Do we have... Do we have... Let me get your database. Bear with me one second. A lot of times I'm in databases from prior testing or just showing something. Let me see. Okay. Do you mind if I link myself to the job and... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Give it a shot? Okay. Sure. I see you did have me in there. So if you go to pipeline and then you're doing APO, now are they doing a drag and drop or using an action ad? I think we're doing the action ad. We're not doing drag and drop. Okay. So APO interview. I'll just do it for whatever date and time. Yeah, like just try APO. And then you'll see what I mean when you hit save. Hopefully. I see that the second one was created. No issue. The only thing that doesn't update is where you see under the interview column, view one. You don't see that refresh until you refresh your pipeline. And then if I do a drag and drop the first interview, now that does automatically refresh. It's when you use action add that it doesn't automatically refresh. I do not have a problem. Well, like I said, we typically, we're not dragging and dropping. We're typically selecting the dropdown, like when we're adding the activity. so the issue is that doesn't refresh automatically when you do that the issue is is when we add the activity like ep or so and then hit save it doesn't the screen does absolutely nothing so people are clicking again and then when it clicks again is like when it refreshes or resets or it like seems like it's taking but in reality once you close that screen it actually took the first time when the users are hitting save. And it just started doing this last week. And again, Robin, forgive me. I don't recall exactly what happened with PCR in normal situations, but that's what's going on, is it looks like there's nothing happening when you're hitting save anymore. So when I did it, I saw a green save successful appear at the top. Okay, that's not happening. That's not happening. All right. Okay, so that tells me, let's see. Could we do a screen share? Sure. Okay, because I want to see, because it said that for me. So I wonder if you need to like clear cash or something. Could be. Well, it's happened to, it could be, but it's happened to all of us now. So, and we've been cleaning up duplicates all week. I'm like, what the heck is going on? And then I put through an EPO Friday night, and it happened to me. I was like, oh, my gosh, this is what's going on. Okay, yeah, let me see what's going on. What could be a little bit different? It seems fine on mine. I just want to kind of see it. Okay. We want me to log me in one, two, three? No, I don't have access to that. I'm going to do a Google Meet. And what is your email address? It's cwiseman. Okay. W-I-S-E-M-A-N at medbest.com okay yeah I'm going to forget even be like outdated Java or something like that that could also be another thing okay sent you an email do you want me to hang up here no tha...
