## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, Sandy Bishop. How are you? Good. How are you? Excuse me. Pardon me. Hey, quick question. I haven't used advanced search under basic search in a while, and I'm not getting any results. I'm trying to figure out what I'm doing wrong. so for example if I go into advanced search for candidates I pick fields I get zip code radius right so I click on that put in my zip code 1104 20 mile radius search okay done that accept to that. Now, under keywords, so if I put in sales and PLC, a product, it doesn't work. Are you putting and in all caps? Just to check. I did that, yes. Remember you told me that. So let me put in sales and then and in caps, right? And the major product line is PLC. It's a keyword. Okay. So where do I click find? Our glass on the right? Upper right? Oh, yeah, that magnifying glass. Exactly. Yeah, our magnifying glass. No match found. Okay. Should be dozens. Let me see. I'll try to recreate that. What was the zip code again? Okay. 1104. Oh, unless I've got a foul zip code. Okay. So that should be near Hyde Park, New York. Correct. Correct. Okay. All right. Let me try to recreate that. Sales and PLC. Search. Yeah, I'm not finding any results for that either. Is there like a specific record that you know should be appearing? No, but I know their records are. Yeah, I mean, that's truly weird. I don't do a lot of work on Long Island, but I've talked to people over time that should have those search codes. let's see okay what if we just did sales yeah you could try that so you put in zip code radius and then put in 1104 okay hit search I accept selected items and put in the keyword sales, right? Yep. Hit the magnifying glass. No match found. Okay. Let's see. What if we broaden it out? Yeah, maybe a wider range. Sure. That's what I'm thinking. Let me try this. Zip code. 1-1-0-4-0. Let's do 50 miles. Right? Yeah. Accept. Put in sales. Okay. magnifying glass. No match. It's impossible. Okay. I'm trying to think of a candidate I can just pull up, but I know they're there. Let's see. Okay, so Jeff Rigel is... So there's a guy named Jeff, J-E-F-F, and last name is Rigel, R-I-D-G-E-L-L. And he is, let's see. It's Lionel Lear Phillips, according to this. Says he's in Fall River, too. Yeah, let me check. He has a zip code there. OK, but I did notice he has the word sales in his resume. Yeah, it's in his resume. So when you use the keywords box, it's not searching through titles. It's only searching through the resume tab, the activity or I'm sorry, the attachments, the notes and keywords in summary on a record. So he did have sales in his resume. So let's see. Just the question is, is he being in the state of New York with the zip code of one zero zero zero one? I wonder if he is in that radius. And this would be like an example of somebody that should be coming up, but it's not. So let me check that a little bit more. By the way, I use keywords on every sales candidate. So every sales candidate I have has sales and then a product code. PLC is the most common one. Okay. So why nothing's coming up is just shocking to me. Okay, let's see. Zip code, radius. Let me write down this zip code again. What was that one more time? 1-1-0-4-0. And you checked it. It looks like it's real, right? I think so. I haven't checked that, but I will look. Let me look up zip code. New Hyde Park area of Long Island. Yep. That is a good one. Okay. So I'm going to do 20-mile radius again. I'm going to search this page for one. Okay, yes, so Jeff Ridgel's zip code is within the search results there. And so when we search for keyword sales and send that zip code raise. Okay, let me check if there's anything else. No. We should get Jeff. Okay. So yeah, he is not coming up and he should be coming up. So there is something wrong Let me Create a ticket and have our tech team take a look. We might need to just run a reindex on your database Sometimes that fixes things like this when the advanced search is acting up so I'll get back to you via email as soon as that's completed and and hopefully that's all it needs is just a re-index. Garrett, is there another way to approach this? I need to find the people on Long Island. And, you know, of course, New York is a huge state, so I don't want to pull up all the people in New York, which is another way to tackle it. Because, you know, unless I know every city in Long Island, I can't segregate them visually. You know? Right. Can you think of another angle to go after Long Island people? Let's see. There's – I'm not exactly sure. It would be the way you're doing it through the advanced search and doing a zip code radius. Let's see. You can do maybe a basic search where you're searching for zip codes that start with 110 and use the keyword sale. Let me see if that does anything before I lead you down that path. Zero. Okay, let's see. Zero, zero. And I'm looking for Jeff from a gel. Okay, yeah, so maybe one w...
