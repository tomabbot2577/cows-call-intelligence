## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is Stephanie. Hi, Stephanie. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hi. How are you? So I understand you're having, inhaling resumes. Are you trying to just do an individual, like right-clicking in your portal or? No. Is Garrett available? I've been working with him, so he's kind of up to speed. up to speed, but if not, I can run through kind of everything that I've tried, and I can explain everything to you. Yeah, I can, yeah, let's do a screen share. Would that be okay? Because then I could see it, and we'll get you fixed up there. All right, bear with me one second. Let me get your email address here. Okay, I'm going to send you, do you happen to have RingCentral? do I have ring central no okay then I'll just do a google meet okay start an instant meeting okay you should get an email from me in just a moment okay and that came from um here it is got it Thank you. Now when you click on that join call to get into the meeting, it's going to ask you about camera and joining with computer audio. You don't need either one of those because we're going to share a screen and you're already on the phone. Okay. Is it sharing with you yet? I was just asking you to get it now. Okay. All right. So now that you're in the meeting, what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of the meeting screen, there's a share screen icon. It's a rectangle with an arrow. Click on that, and that's going to pop up a window. Go over at the right where it says entire screen, and then pick which screen to show. Perfect. Okay. Let me. So when I go to do the inhale, it puts that they're bad. Let me see if it'll work this time around. Because Garrett told me a bunch of stuff to download. And so I just finished downloading everything. Please put these under duplicate, which is not bad. that's something different. Can we open one up? Like where are you getting these from? Let me see. Oh hold on it's opening the resume. So it's letting me open the resume the fact that it imported them just now which is good we also got two folders hold on let me let me try to do this from scratch so if i hit a monster get some new resumes because yesterday it was putting them all into bad oh okay that's And it was the error was that it could not read. Could not read them. This will do a new search string. Okay, so we'll just try to do like 20 resumes. Yeah, that one says confidential. Some of those say confidential. So I don't know what we'll be able to do with those because. Now, I also see you have two folders called resumes to inhale. Yeah. Actually, in a third one, too. So let's first, because you got that one, it was bad duplicate. You should have a bad duplicate imported. So the end point I can just move up? No, no, because that no, actually let's do it this way. Let's make a new folder and let's just call it resumes for PCR. Because right now for some reason you've got like three things called resumes to inhale and you can't just like move those around. Okay, so let's go new folder. Yeah, resumes for PCR. Yeah. And then I'll take all my Salesforce ones that I just got. And then we're going to have to change that inhaler to look at this folder. I just want to kind of see it without. Yeah, we'll read it. Okay. Then let's open up your inhaler. There you go. And then we're, okay, Outlook. Yeah, you're going to go look for your resumes for PCR folder. And that's saying could not open file. Okay. It's probably taking a moment trying to get the folder names. And you'll probably have to expand that inbox. It's probably going to be under that. It's a bummer it's not right at the top like how it shows in here. So resumes to PCR. Oh, there it is. Okay. Click okay. And then before we do an import, so go ahead and check that or hit okay there. Okay. Let's go up at the top left. Now let's go up to actions. let's go to connection settings. I just want to see double check here just to make sure. Okay and hit test. Perfect hit okay. Exit this screen and then go to actions and this time up at the top left and this time select preferences. Let's lower that first resume size to 50 and then any chance did you already add a zero to the maximum I always just kind of do both yeah I did okay perfect all right let's see and move to Duke folder okay everything else looks fine okay let's hit okay and then let's try import from email now Okay. Okay. So I guess we'll just take a look. Yeah, I'm a little concerned. I'm a little concerned. So let's go back to the inhaler because I'm not seeing anything showing a preview. Oh, it says could not open file. And that is this time zone for you? 237. Okay. I'm two hours later, so I just wanted to make sure. Okay. Can you do me a favor? Can you open those files? Can you go to, like, one of the e-mails? So where did it go? Look on your resume for PCR folder. Hold on just a moment. Okay, what did you say? Go to that resume for PCR folder and then expand it. Okay, go into BAD. into bad. The PDF, okay, open. Save time with document ...
