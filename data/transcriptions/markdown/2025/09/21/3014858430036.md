 Hey, how's it going? Yo, do you remember what we used for the company name and serial number? For the inhaler? Oh yeah, if you go to register it and put in the company name that you're looking for and then put in Sucker as the serial number, it'll bring back the code or the numbers for that company name it's just sucker yeah as the code let me write this down I'm getting it set up now. Cool. You know what, and I meant to look at our Learning Center article. I don't think the Learning Center article was written when New Outlook was created, but I'm just going to double check. In the article, our learning center, it says you can set it up to use Outlook, or if you use Outlook Express, choose MAPI compatible or the PCR mail option. So I wonder if Outlook Express is similar to Outlook New. No, MAPI is a whole different protocol. Oh, okay. So it's showing my classic Outlook folders. Hmm. Okay. Yeah, that's what I figured. It's got to be using the same technology as our portal. How it can do takes forever to download too. Yeah. Because I'll have to uninstall Classic Outlook. Oh, to even test it. Oh, yeah, I don't know. I almost want to guess that it's just going to be connected to the Outlook Classic. But that's up to you if you want to go through the trouble of uninstalling Outlook Classic and try to reinstall it again later on. Yeah, that's fine. Cool. I even saw that Microsoft in their store, they kind of hid the link to download the Outlook Classic. If you go to search for it in the Microsoft store, it's not really showing up. So luckily I still had a direct link that I used to help customers that need the old version. Nope, payment. Payment. Just uninstalled the new one. Okay. Thank you. no come on all those Oh, there we go. Yeah. It only shows the... Those classic ones? Yeah, I'm pretty sure we had a ticket for it, too. Oh, okay. Yeah. Thank you. Maybe it's one of the same limitations that Microsoft puts on us with our Outlook add-in thing. Maybe we can't connect with Resume Inhaler. Oh yeah, Sean said four months ago in March it only works with yep it only works with classic outlook wow okay good to know i'll put that in the group chat so everybody's kind of aware excellent yeah i'll respond to yours gotcha there we go excellent alright thanks no problem bye...
