## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey Tyler, it's Truett Neely. How you doing? Good. How are you, Truett? Good. Hey, I need your help. We're redoing all of our stages for Roll of Bliss across the company. And so a lot of that's just kind of admin work. But before I do that, I need to have a key that shows the stage sort order. I don't think you can change that then so I need to know how PCR automatically sorts that on a roll-up list all the stages are clicked so that we can design the stages around the way that PCR was designed yeah so give me one second here You can just email it to me. So we don't really have a sort order like in a document. The easiest way to tell is if you look at the global stage setup in the database, so if you go to system i usually just do okay sorry i'm in the car yeah but it's i could take a screenshot of it and send it to you okay okay and that'll tell me yeah so just like how it follows like it'll show you which ones appear first yeah because it's a grid right so it has columns and rows essentially and i don't know how it flows throughout the stages because i think some of the ones at the beginning uh aren't necessarily listed at the top you know yep yeah i'll take some screenshots and send it over to you real quick okay and then if we're changing it do i what's the best way to do Do I need to change my stages and then just, since I'm a model user, copy that to somebody else? Yep, that's usually the easiest way. Okay, you talked about global stages. So, like, am I able to change that within PCR and then everybody that is a user would adopt that? Only if you require global roll-up list stages and turn it on. But that would be for roll-up lists going forward. not existing ones. So if you're already using the regular ones, the global stages. Okay. Got it. And what does global stages actually do? Like I get that it starts after you turn it on, but what's the purpose? So it allows you to create multiple templates. So let's say you have like a recruiting template and a sourcing template. It would make it so you could select which template you're using on a roll-up, and it can force all the users to use at least one of those templates in their roll-up lists. I like that, actually. So you could have one for business development and one for recruiting? Yep. Oh, wow. Okay. And what other constraints are there other than it just has to be on roll-up lists going forward? anything so you wouldn't be able to apply it to like existing roll-ups where there's stages already selected so okay so if the stages are already selected you'd have to make a new roll-up list add all the names to the new one and then none of the old stages would carry over correct okay so if we had an existing roll-up list of let's say a thousand names and we already had stages on that but we want to be able to still maintain you know the the idea of the stages in the next one how would you go about even doing that how would you convert it you you would manually have to convert it. Geez, really? No other way? Nope. Okay. Yeah, that's why it's like it's kind of one or another with either the global stages or the regular stages. Okay. And then when you do the global stages, does it run automations? Like, we didn't notice this until we started copying them over. But when we do automation setup, let's say for myself, and then they copy that to a new person, they don't, like there's not global automations that are set up and then you can just go customize that per person. It was like duplicating all of the automations. Does that make sense? Yeah, the automations work the same through global stages as they do for the regular stages. Oh, they do? Okay, so you can't have, you can't have, we leave a voicemail and then it sends them a text and then the username of the person in PCR. are like it's not a it's not a global it's not it's not global where you could just have one automation set to one stage and everybody use it it's everybody would have duplicate automations so with the with some of those automations yeah with the ones that really trigger it as like the form letters. Right. With the text message, a lot of times you can set it to who, let me see, it's been a little bit. I'll give you, I'll give you an example. Like we have one stage we're going to have where it's, it's saying, like after we text somebody through sense and they ask about like where's this job located we all want to send them the same response um and so we'll have a stage that says hey happy to share details let's get on the phone so i just want to write that automation one time and then when when any user clicks that stage on a roll-up list then it would trigger that text and it would just have the you know insert field pcr user name or whatever it was for their phone number or that field, we would have that put in. So then depending on what user is actually logged in, it would just send their details instea...
