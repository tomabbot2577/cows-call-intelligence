I was giving you a call regarding sending an email. We'll just need to have you re-authenticate in what's called your email alias. I'm going to go ahead and email you instructions. It's pretty simple, but if you get stuck or need some more help, just give me a call back. My number will also be in the email, in the signature, but my number is 440-946-5214. Again, it's 440-946-5214, and I'm at extension 5466. Thank you....
