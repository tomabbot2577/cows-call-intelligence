## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Giselle from the Newport Group. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Thank you. I was just calling in to see if you could assist me with disabling a user's PCR. Sure. So I just tried to... Sorry, let me just... I'm just looking for the... Password list. Okay. I'll actually log in on my end too to make sure that it, that you did that all. Okay, so which database are you in currently? The Newport Group, OneWord. Got it. Found that one. Cool. So to start, just go to System in the main menu up at the top. Yep. Then do Users on the left, Manage Users on the right. Gotcha. And then I'm on, yeah, TMangan. Okay, go ahead and select that username. Yep. And then in the bottom frame, go to Security on the left, the padlock icon. Yep. And then scroll all the way down to the final heading called Security Policy. There'll be a checkbox to say account is disabled. Check that and then hit save in the action menu. So I did this earlier and it was saying password and verify password do not match. And then I went to the information tab. Let me just quickly retype the password again. Oh, okay. Okay, save. Now it's saying password has been used recently and is unavailable. It may be used again after 75 days. But I just entered his actual password. Oh, on the information tab up at the top? Yeah, yep. Okay, so let's see. Maybe just change the password to something new then in the password and verify password fields. 25. Okay, yep, that works. Sorry. Yeah, I don't know why I didn't do that earlier. Okay, cool. that's disabled. I think now it is. And then I think I'll just have to delete it at the end of the month. All right. I think, yeah, that's it. Sorry. Thank you. No problem. Yeah. Let me double check here while I'm still here. I'm going to refresh the page. Security. Yep. It looks like it's all disabled. Excellent. Yeah. And feel free to delete that username as well with the trash can in the action menu at any point. But when it's disabled, nobody can log in under that username anyway. So you're in good shape. All right. That's perfect. Yeah, that's fine. I think we'll just delete it at the end of the month once we go through everything. But yeah, awesome. Thank you so much for your help. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye-bye. You too....
