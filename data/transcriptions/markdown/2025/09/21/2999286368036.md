## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, hi. My name is Ed Clivine. My company is the Daniel Adams Group. Okay. And I retired several months ago, and I guess I still need to pay you for some months here. So I think I'm supposed to pay 80% of the remainder of my contract. Yeah, let me see what's going on here. Let's see. Thank you. Let's see. Contract renews or terminates and then auto-renews. What's the dates here? October 18th each year. So let me go into somewhere else here. See what we've got going on. So you're wanting to go through a formal cancellation? Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And the other thing is, I think you still have $250 of mine as a credit for training that was never used. Yeah, we don't credit back training hours, though. Like, if they just weren't used, they weren't used. Yeah, I got to say, I feel pretty disappointed. I've been with you for 12, 15 years, and I really am pretty disappointed that you're making me finish out this contract, even though I'm retiring for health reasons. Okay. Transactions. So those, okay. So we've got the May and June. Yeah. Okay. Let me see. One of these looks like an added late payment. Let me take that off. Thank you. Take that off. Okay. Thank you. Hello? Hello? Hi, can you hear me? Yes, can you hear me? Oh, yes. Lost you there for a minute, it seems. Okay. I don't know what happened there. I lost your audio there. Okay, let me see here. I can't remember for you. Was the ticket started even? I got something that said if I wanted to pay this off, it was $483 or $438, one of the two. It had a 20% discount to pay here for cancellation. Okay, here's the ticket that we started. Okay. Yes, that's 483. 483. Now, did you need a data return? Do I need what? A data return? No, I think I'm all set on that. I just moved everything into Excel and I think that'll work just fine since I'm retiring anyway okay how much is it for data return I have to look at your contract let me see because it depends I know they're higher now, but it just depends what's in your contract. Let's see. $125. Okay. No, I think I'm good with it. Okay. Here's what I'd be willing to do because it's a retirement. You've been a long customer. what I can do is for the remainder of the contract do what's called a $20 on hold fee and that's at least easier and we'll just kind of consider it on hold I really appreciate whatever you can do I get it, you've been a long time it's not like you're leaving to go to a competitor no, I love you people, you've been great All right. So what I'm going to do. I just been trying to get you to be able to win a championship out there in Cleveland. But that's the trust. Well, we kind of did. We got the Cavs. I mean, we got one. Yeah. Yeah. We got one. That was like one hell of a summer. Okay. So what I'm going to consider you immediately was it was called on hold. Okay. Okay. I normally am not supposed to do this, but I'm just going to do it. I appreciate it. It is what it is. Okay. so the two that are open that one we would want that and then what I'll do is so let's see shoot I just had it up Daniel Adam and I'll do okay so I took the late fee off one so that would be July August September right July, August. Okay, here's what I'm doing. I'm deleting your recurring. Now what date do you want the database turned off? When, well... Like access disabled. Yeah. How about July 17th, if that's when the next payment is? Okay. That'll give me a couple weeks to do it, if there's anything I forgot. New invoice. So we're going to make this due, and we'll say July. Oh, shoot. Let me go back. What was the price? Okay, so invoices go on the 27th. Okay. Bye, August. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. this final and this one will be for $60 it'll be all your holds we'll just consider it on hold until the end of your term okay great okay but I will okay so let me save that one okay so um customer on hold until end of contract. Made invoice 2203 473 to cover You said what date, July? 17th or whatever work, yeah. Yeah, well, I just want to let the person that turns databases off and on and stuff like that, like what date. We don't want to do it too soon and stuff for you. Okay. Okay, so the recurring has been stopped. The two that are open, and then the third invoice, that's just going to be just the hold fees for the remainder. And so at least we have that. Great. Like, can I just pay this now? Yeah. Do you, like, I can, here, I can go over here. I'm going to send them to your biller. Okay. Pull up your card. You know, I don't see where to get into my credit card. It expired in May. I don't see where, how I get in to change. Are you in the new customer billing portal? Probably not if I don't see it. Okay. Because that would be, like, if you did sign in, you would go into what's called the vault area. Yeah, you don't have that set up. Okay. So what I'm going to do, and I'm actually going to take it where you don't have to. Or I can just give you the credit card if you'd...
