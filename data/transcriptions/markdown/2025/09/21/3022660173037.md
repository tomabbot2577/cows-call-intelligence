## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, hi. Scott Hobart from TICOM Life Sciences Recruiting. I want to straighten out my most recent bill. Okay. Let me go over to your information. Hold on one second. Sure. Let's see. I attempted to do this on my phone a few days ago, and I guess it didn't take, but I got another message. oh let me see what's going on with yours let's see it should have sent an invoice to scott.hobar okay and you received that email right okay yeah i'm like my outlook is my pc I'm in the middle of a move, and I'm in the middle of this array right now. Gotcha. I got it on the phone, and I tried to input the information you needed to update my billing information, but decided to go with human beings. Okay. Let's see. You do have auto pay enabled with a card that ends in 0521. Is that still correct? That's still correct. Okay. Do you want me to just try doing the auto-pay on it, on the open invoice? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. It should have auto-paid. Let me see. Yeah, I'm wondering why it didn't work. It's been working for years. Well, we did switch billing systems, so you have to kind of put in your new card, which it looks like you did. Correct. Let me see what's going on here. Why is the email open? Maybe it's sometime it's good. Okay, let me try it. Let me make sure it processes them. Bear with me one second. Okay. Let's hear if you wish to auto pay. $119.95. Yep, ma'am. Okay, it's been queued for auto pay. It takes a moment here. Okay. Well, let me see. timeline. Sorry, new system kind of figure out which place is the best place to go to see what's going on. Transactions. Oh, cards being declined. It doesn't tell me why. You want to double check all the information on the card? Yeah, let me see that. Let me, I don't know if it tells me all that. I can try. Let's see. Edit. I don't know if it says email. I changed my mailing address with the bank, but that shouldn't affect any of this. All I could see is it ends in 0521. So what I could do is add a new card and try it again. Scott, space, Hobart is the name on the card, right? It's actually Scott, space, M, space, Hobart. M as in Michael. Okay. And then the card number? 5581-8520-0000-0521. Expiration date? I'm sorry, 01-29. The CVC number? 213. Address, 1281 Wynn Hemshell Boulevard. Yeah, you know what? Let's just make it my home. I'm working out of the home office now. Okay. So are you ready? Yeah. 1-0-6-5. Okay. 3rd Avenue. That's 3rd Avenue. Northwest is just N-W. Okay. and that's the town of Carmel C-A-R-M-E-L Indiana you are up by one of my favorite restaurants which one? Verde okay it's like an Ironworks up by was it something crossing I went to Indianapolis for a soccer tournament it was so good what is the zip code this is all the information associated with the zip code I'm sorry, with the card, right? Okay. 46032. 46032. And that's all the address associated with the card? Yeah, it should be. Okay. Maybe that's the thing. I changed the address with the card. That could be. Feels like a bad response. We're trying to expect a status code. They won't let me do it. Okay. Okay. Okay, what do I do then? I didn't like something I put in it. You want to run it all back, make sure we got it right? Well, it kind of removed everything that I did. And I don't know if it's the other card that is stored. But I don't have security to delete a card either. You're in billing. It should be yours. Yeah, I don't know if they just didn't give it to me or because I know like our bookkeeper has access to it or if it's just supposed to be like you're supposed to do it on your own. And I wonder if it didn't like because there was a card already ending in that number, but it doesn't let me take that out. Are you you're not at your computer right now, right? I am actually. Okay, I'm going to do this. I'm going to send you a link to the customer portal. Hold on one second here. Do you know what? You want to send it to a different address? Because my Outlook on my PC is jacked up. It's not getting emails. I get them on my phone. Well, okay. I don't. I think you'll have to register. You'll need to be where you're scott.hobar at touchandrecruiting.com. Okay. Well, I can do that on my phone. Okay. All right, so I'm just going to do it this way then. Let me just manually email it to you. Hold on one second. Compose. Add in. Okay, and I'm going to Customer Portal. Do you know if you've created an account in this Customer Portal link or did you just kind of pay from the invoice before from our new system? I'm not sure I understand the question. I got the email, and I see I opened it on my phone, and I think I went through the process of updating the information. When you paid in June, did you just kind of pay from the new invoice? Oh, no. In June is the last one that I paid, correct? Yeah. Yeah, that was just an automatic payment. unless our bookkeeper kind of went into the back end and did it. So we have a new billing portal.
