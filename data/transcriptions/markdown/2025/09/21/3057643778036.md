## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Peter Duflo from SV Executive Search, and we used to be Strategic Ventures. How have you been? Good. How are you? Good, good. I've got, I think, an easy one for you today. Two things. One is, could you just walk me through, one of my fields called title on a contact record is required. I want to make it non-required. So that one's pretty easy. What you'll do is you'll go to any name record. Okay, I'm there. You'll go into the options menu of that name record. So it'll be that little hamburger-looking menu over on the right-hand side. and you'll see it's like three lines I'm using the portal if that matters I see the gear on the right hand side so let me pull up my portal just... Oh, wait. I just thought... Well, a portal with a lot of things pinned to it. Yeah, so in the name record in portal... Yeah, it'll still be that menu over to the right. The top right. If you hover over it, it'll say options. If I hover over the gear? what does the gear say? Does the gear say customize? Email, change my password, change my theme, blah, blah, blah. So the menu will be under that if you're in a name record. Add activity. Add notes. So it's a little menu that's like three lines going across. That's the options menu. Yeah, I understand that. I see that in the center of the screen, and it has various things checked off that I can pin to that line. You might have to scroll over all the way to the right in the portal, like in your reading pane. No, it just doesn't happen. I just scrolled all the way to the right in the reading pane and I see I don't see those three lines on the right hand side of my screen. It's the same menu. Oh, maybe you moved it over. It's the same menu you would go into like save a change on a record. Like where you would go for the like the floppy disk icon. Yeah, yeah. So it should be the right of the floppy disk icon. okay i'm there and i see the three lines and it allows me to click on things to pin them to the that line which what are you looking for which one customize yeah i got it okay perfect so if you click on customize it'll excuse me it'll bring up your name record layout Yeah, I'm there. And you'll see the three dots and lines at the end of the field. So you'll find those at the end of the title field. Yep, you'll click that. You'll uncheck the box that says required. All right, done. Done, and then just make sure you save the change. There should be like a menu at the top of the screen. where you can click into it and hit save or click on the floppy disk icon. Okay, I think I'm done. Let me go. Then you'll just need to reload a name record. Yeah, let me try candidates. While I'm doing this, the next thing is, do we have an API with candidates from a LinkedIn profile record? so we don't have to grab off LinkedIn, their profile. The only thing that we have with LinkedIn that you can grab candidates is if you use the PCR capture tool. Tell me about that. So that's the Chrome extension. Yep. Where if you go to a profile, it'll pop up on the side of your screen where you could parse them into the database. Okay, that's what I'm looking for. Do you have anything you can email me on that? Sure do. I'll send you the complete setup of it. Is it easy? Yep, it takes two minutes at the most. Okay. Great, you've got my email address? Yeah, let me just grab that here, and I'll verify the email that we have on file for you. So what I'm going to send you is a link to our learning center that has the capture set up. It also has a little video in there that walks you through setting it up as well. Okay, but that link will take me right to it? Yep, it'll take you right to our learning center, and in that article as well we'll have the download for the capture tool. Then the email we have on file, pduflo at svexecutivesearch.com. Yes. Perfect. You can send that to me. That's all I needed for today. Perfect. Easy peasy. Just send it over to you so you should get it here in just a second. Excellent. How's your day been? Busy, but makes the day go by quick. Yeah. How about yours? Good, good. Well, now that you've given me this capture configurations, PCR capture setup and browser, I just got it. What should a PC be? But I'm looking at the notes. It looks a little complicated. I don't see anything referring to LinkedIn profile. So it works on a number of sites, including LinkedIn. If you'd like, we can hop on a quick screen share and I can walk you through it. It's actually two of my recruiters want it. And so what I'm trying to do is get enough information to pass it to them so they're not lost. Yeah, I mean, if you send them that article, like I said, there's that video in there that walks you through the setup as well as those instructions. There is a short video in here. Does it work pretty good? Yeah, it's honestly because we offer it as a free tool. It's one of the drivers that a lot of people sign up fo...
