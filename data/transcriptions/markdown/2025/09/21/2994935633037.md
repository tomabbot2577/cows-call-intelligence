## 💬 Full Transcript

 Love this, Brian. Yeah, I was hoping you could help me. I use PCR, and I was just looking at PCRM and trying to figure out what exactly it is. So I wanted to see if there's somebody I could talk to to find out more about it. Sure. Yeah, so who am I speaking with? My name is JP Wright. Hey, JP. Nice to meet you. I'm Brian. So PCRM is simply a new version of PC Recruiter. It is not a direct replacement for PCR9, which is what you are using today. It is designed to be utilized in conjunction with 9. So let's say, and I don't know what your office situation is like. if you have 10 people in your office, five could be on M and five could be on PCR 9. What PCRM is designed to do is for our clients who have embraced sequencing and the premium package, email campaigns, analytics, mostly sequencing, it is designed as a lighter weight, easier to use, easier to implement one screen, not a split screen solution for your folks who are really, it's designed for the folks who are spending four to six hours a day on the phone. It will not have some features. And that's why I'm saying it's definitely not a direct replacement for PCR 9. For example, right now you can't merge records. That's one thing that I'm lobbying for to get, you know, updated in PCRM because I think it's a pretty important thing. But there's a lot of admin stuff that happens inside of PCR that will not be in PCRM. And so, again, the concept is it's designed to be for the folks that are on the phones the most versus your admin people. So you may have admin people on 9 and your sales people on M. You may have your younger people on M and your more experienced people on 9. You know, it just depends on which way they, you know, if you have a $500,000 biller and they like nine, you're not going to move them if they don't want to go, you know, that kind of thing. So that's basically it. Are you using the premium feature sequencing, email campaigns, that type of thing? No, not really. But I'm looking at SourceWale. I think SourceWale kind of does a lot of that. Yes. If you're familiar with that. Mm-hmm. And that is in PCR. So, you know, you could try PCR sequencing if you wanted to. Completely up to you, obviously. So what we have, does it have sequencing in it? Yes, you have sequencing. You have the ability to add sequencing to PCR9. and the premium package and so forth. But there are some features of, for example, here's a really good example. PCR9 has our standard sequencing, okay? PCRM has our standard sequencing. PCRM also has simple sequencing. In a nutshell, simple sequencing is easier to set up. You can quickly throw together, you know, an outreach campaign in two or three minutes versus having to sit down and think it through something that would be utilized for the entire office, you know, with all kinds of options. And if they'd say this or if they do this or if they request this, we go down that path. So sequencing, you have a lot of options as far as how you want to set it up. And if you want to have a complex sequence that manages a lot of automations and things like that, you can set that up. But in PCRM, you also have simple sequencing, which allows you to just set up a blast email, a phone call, and maybe a text message on the back end of it, something like that. Real simple, real fast, and get that, you know, out the door. Yep. Yep. Now, I haven't looked at the sequencing since we – because we really just haven't kind of gotten full-fledged into it, even though we've been using it for a few years. You know, the sequencing was pretty – at the time, it was pretty simple stuff, and it was very kind of canned. And, like, for a business development sequence for us, like, it's not exactly easy to just come up with a, like, a cut, you know, a 40-cover business development sequence. So we just haven't used it. But now that I'm, you know, we're looking at trying to use it more. So are you telling me that you guys also offer a better version of sequencing too? Well, so as I stated, PCR-9 has our standard sequencing tool in it. PCR-M has our standard sequencing tool in it also. PCR-M also has what we're referring to as simple sequencing. So it allows you to set up a sequence without really having to think through all of the complete options. And, you know what I mean, if I just want to set up, you know, a blast email and follow-up phone calls, I can quickly set that up and I'm off to the races. Whereas with standard sequencing, you have to kind of sit through and figure out exactly how you want to set that thing up and with all the different options. There are use cases for the standard sequencing solution, because sometimes you want to go that route. And there are use cases for simple sequencing. And I have found that the simple sequencing does help me with my – because I do recruiting, and it does help me with my recruiting. Okay. Okay. All right. So, like, one of the things that I liked about SourceWale was, like, it prompts you to do things within ...
