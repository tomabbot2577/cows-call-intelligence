## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, let's look at something. All right. Birmingham Group. My database is MR Birmingham. Okay. Okay. Birmingham Group. Logging in now. MR Birmingham. All right, perfect. I'm logged in. So what issues are you having? All right, on user AG, I accidentally in her SendGrid fucking email alias clicked on sign in with Microsoft and have broken it. But now when I plug in all the information for SendGrid again, it doesn't work. I destroyed the alias, made a new one. It still doesn't work. What do I do? Okay, I'll take a look. Other SendGrid IDs working perfectly. like every other one. Gotcha. Okay. I tried regenerating API key. Didn't help. All right. AG user email. Okay, here we go. Send grid API key. Okay. Um, So the API key, let me see, that looks a little shorter than the – here, let me check maybe a different username. Actually, it's probably fine. Go back to – do you know another user that has maybe a SendGrid already set up? RH. No, I don't actually. Yeah, I do. Hold on. Let me look at my own shit. Okay. RH2 probably. Hold on. Email. Alias list. Yeah, I have a chain grid with identical shit, and when I test connection, it is authorization successful. Okay. Oh, the password looks a lot longer in the edit alias screen on your username, RH2. When you grab that from SendGrid, have you double-checked that it's the right length one? This one just looks so much longer. Okay, so let me see if I can go into the grid and generate the longer one, but also I think I have an email with it. Hold on. Let me see. Okay, I see a longer version of that. Hold on. I spent the whole time. I'm fucking sad. Yeah, I spent the whole time. I'm sorry I called, bro. I'm sorry I even called, but it is the longer version one. And it works. And I'm fucking annoyed with this whole situation. I've had this recruiter bugging me all the fucking hell about this. I'm glad you talked us out with you. I probably should just call fucking tech to tech talk with, so then I can fucking just be done with it. And I appreciate you today. Yeah, happy to help. Call in any time. But, God damn it, the API key that they give me is – or the one they give you the copy, I guess, is just a truncated one. But they don't say – I don't know, dude. I'm annoyed, but fucking I appreciate you for fucking talking this out and wasting your time. I hope you have an excellent day. Yeah, not a waste of time. Happy to help. All right, reach out if you need anything else. Thanks, man. And I don't know. I'll fucking click all yeses on the survey or whatever. I don't think anyone. But if they do, I'll take care of it. All good. I appreciate it, man. Hey, thanks, Todd. You have a good day. You too. Bye....
