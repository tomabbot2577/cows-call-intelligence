## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Giselle with the Newport Group. How are you? Good. How are you today? Not too bad, thank you. I just wanted to bring something up quickly. I think one of the candidates we currently have in an open position in the pipeline, for some reason um he just went back again to the submittal but he's actually on his second interview and then like in the earlier dates it doesn't show when he was submitted like like it's so weird yeah it's weird are they in oh it's uh the newport group one word And what's the position they're in? It's Director of Dev with MRK Partners. All right. And is that Jason? Mm-hmm. Let me take a look at... Ah, I see what happened. So it looks like user L Flynn was maybe trying to back, like add in a step that they had skipped over originally. but they didn't adjust the date and time of that step correctly. Oh, so if you, if, are you in that position right now? Yeah. Yeah. I haven't. Yeah. If you click on Jason's profile picture and then go to history, yep. You'll see that the date for the submittals is eight 20 and eight 18. Yeah. Those other ones. Yep. What you can do is click those three dots at the end of the step. Gotcha. Edit it or delete. an extra one that you don't need for the submittal. Let me delete. You're about to delete an interaction. Okay, that's fine. It's refreshing. Okay. And then... Yeah, you'll just need to edit the submittal to the correct day and time. So, any time... uh when should i put it i'm not really sure when she submitted him originally as long as it's like you could just put like seven eight because the first interview was seven nine as long as it's before those because where they show in the pipeline is where their current like the most recent step date okay got it so since they added that step later and didn't adjust it that's why he's shown in submittal because it's saying, oh, this is their latest step that they were put in. Gotcha. And then will that, so I just changed the submittal to 7-8. Do I just need to refresh it to make sure he goes into the second interview tab? Yep, I just refreshed it on my end too, and now he's back in second interview. Awesome. Okay, awesome. I see him there now. Perfect. So what happened again? Sorry, so I can just let her know why that happened. Yeah, it looked like they tried to add a historical step. Okay, gotcha. But didn't go back and edit the step after to reflect the correct date in the timeline. Right. Okay, got it. All right, no worries. I think that should be it because we did have this happen to Eric, but I think with his case, he had like two tabs open and then he tried editing it on one tab and then it didn't reflect on the other. And until he tried to do it again. But I think this should be fine now. All right. Awesome. Thank you so much. I will just keep that noted for next time it happens. Thank you. Yep. Not a problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. No worries. We'll do. Thanks so much. Have a great day. You too. Thank you. Bye....
