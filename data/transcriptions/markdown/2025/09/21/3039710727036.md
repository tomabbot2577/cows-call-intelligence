## 💬 Full Transcript

 Steve Kuhn speaking. Hello, Steve. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, I'm fine. Thanks. How are you? I am well. I wanted to give you a quick call just to kind of follow up. Great. I am attempting to – my account has been on hold since March of this year, and I've decided I'm definitely going to get out of business. So I have to go ahead and pull the plug. And do I need to talk to you, or is there anybody – who can help me with this? Well, I can get the process started. What I can do is I can put in a ticket to begin the cancellation process. All right. Then I need to know, do you need the data? Do you need a data return? What does that mean? What would happen is we would make the data available in a SQL database that you can download and take with you or give to someone else or anything like that. Do you need to take with you the data that you have in PC recruitment? No, I do not. However, do you all keep it? Is it up in the cloud somewhere? Or once we do this, is it gone? No, we keep it for, I think, a year. They keep it. Okay. And then after that, eventually, it'll be archived, whatever. Okay. Well, I'm a one-man band. It's just me, single dads. No, I don't need to take anything with me. Okay. Okay. And when do you want to – that effective, when do you want to cancel it? Today, ASAP. Okay, and you're just retiring, closing down the company? Yes. Okay. Well, I'm keeping the company. I'm just not going to be recruiting anymore. Okay, okay, okay. Very well. What are you doing instead? Whatever. I don't know. I'm just going to keep the company if I do, I don't know, if I wanted to do something totally else, you know? Perfect. No problem. Very well. Well, let me go ahead and get that ticket in, and then my accounting team is going to get in touch as to next steps, anything like that. But they can go ahead and get it closed. I'll put it effective today. That sounds good. Do you need anything else from me? I don't think so, but they'll let you know if they do. Okay. I appreciate your help. Okay. Thank you. Certainly. Thank you. Take care. Bye. You too. Bye....
