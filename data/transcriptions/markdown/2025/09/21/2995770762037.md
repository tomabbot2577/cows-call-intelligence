There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, Chrissy. How are you? Jim, can you hear me okay? I do. Do you hear me okay? I can. I can hear you. Excellent. Doing okay. How are you? I'm pretty well. I am pretty well. I am just kind of waiting on Jason here. Thanks for getting us in today and getting everything started. And your data is all moved in from Mike, right? That's correct. Yes. Awesome. So what we're going to do today, we're going to go through and kind of take a look at just a few questions with Jason. Jason is going to be your trainer. He's going to get you trained up on PCRecruiter and he is going to be the one who will get a couple of calls. I think he usually schedules a couple or three calls on this first initial consulting call. So we'll do that at the conclusion of the call. You would, if you ever need to add users or drop users or if there's anything you need that you don't know who to come to, come find me. I'm for adding, dropping users, upgrades, downgrades, anything like that. You can always reach to me as an account manager as well. And then Jason's going to get you trained and he'll be the one for how-tos and stuff like that. So I will turn the call over now to Jason to go through the few questions he has, get a little information from you, and then he'll get some initial calls scheduled for you in the coming week to two. Okay, thank you. Awesome. Hi, Chrissy. Like Jim said, I'm going to be your PCR trainer. The questions I have today are going to kind of just help guide what our training process is going to look like, just to provide some context to me. So the first question I have is going to be what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing, like permanent placement, contract placing, Like, what are you thinking? I only do permanent placement. Okay, perfect. And do you have a specific niche or industry you're working in? I work primarily in engineering. Engineering, okay. And have you worked as a recruiter before? 25 years. Oh, heck yeah. Okay. Within the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? No, I'm not anticipating it, but it could happen. So I'll definitely let you guys know if it does. Perfect. Okay. Who am I going to answer? I imagine you've worked with a CRM or an ATS before. So like which ones have you used before? I've actually used PCR before. Oh, perfect. I've used PCR and Crelate and a lot of other ones during my time in corporate. But primarily in the last 15 years in my own company, I've used PCR or Crelate. create or nothing just i'm a horrible save all the resumes in my in my emails and uh so but okay okay awesome um so this next one's going to kind of relate to the speed at which we go through our training sessions um hold on one second let me check how many hours uh okay so you have 10 hours of training. And each training session is traditionally an hour long. We have a fast, moderate, or a slow speed. Fast being three a week, moderate being two, and slow being one. How do you feel you'd like those to go? Is it, are you able to adjust that or is it one forever? You can change it whenever you like. Okay. I'm going to start with one. and we just FYI my husband and I were out of town last week it was our 25th wedding anniversary but we had an emergency earlier today and I'm so sorry that's why I rescheduled so I'm not sure what my schedule will be like for the next couple weeks but I can I can let you know. And I'll know more after, I'll know more in a couple of hours, but I appreciate your flexibility and I'm really sorry. Yeah, you do not need to apologize. I'm as flexible as you need me to be. If you ever need to move something around or reschedule, just let me know and I'll absolutely work with you. No issues, no concern. Chrissy, I have a question for you. Chrissy, when was your 25th anniversary? What day? Monday, the 16th. Oh, Monday, June 10th was my 25th wedding anniversary. No way. We're so close there, Jim. I mean, we didn't have a long call, right? Yeah. You said last week. I'm like, last week? I was just a week or so ago. I was a week or so ago. Well, congratulations, right? And congrats to you as well. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Okay. So, Chrissy, what operating system are you using? Is it like a Microsoft? Is it a Mac computer? It's a Windows HP. Windows? Yeah, it's a Microsoft Windows HP. Okay. Which browser are you currently using, like Chrome, Edge? I primarily use Chrome. I did have Canary for a long time, Canary on the Chrome, but I think right now I just have regular Chrome. Okay, perfect. And your email provider, is it Microsoft? Is it Gmail?
