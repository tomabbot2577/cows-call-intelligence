## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, man. Hey, how's it going? It's going. How about you? Pretty good. I like how you set your RingCentral phone to play the Beatles. Oh, I totally forgot about that. I never call myself, so I think I did that when we first switched phone systems and completely forgot that was in there. Yeah, very cool. Yeah, it's like the hold music for my line, I guess. Yeah. Let me look back at this. Oh, they're right, like they're out in Hudson. They're locals. Yep. Cool. So they pair advisors with job seekers to help them get employed. Single pipeline for the entire database. Okay, so they only have one job, basically. So they're not like doing, right, like job board, really. They're just doing registration and everybody goes into the same pipeline? Exactly. And the pipeline is just keeping track of that process of, you know, they need to fill out this form, meet with their advisor, do this with the advisor, do that with the advisor. Interesting. Okay. So in that case, probably then, so we don't really need to do a job board so much as we just need a registrations form. Yeah. Because they're not applying to anything, really. They're just going into the database. You probably could just do an automation that just puts them in the pipeline. In the inbox. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm wondering, because if there's only one job, because you can do an automation that adds people to a pipeline, right? I think you can. Let me double check that. That might be simpler, would be just to do registration, because they're not creating a login or anything like that. They're just putting themselves in the database. I'm looking at the automations, too. Let's see here. When action. I had to roll up. Maybe not. Yeah, I thought the pipeline something was tricky with it where they weren't able to do automations. All right. So basically it'll have to be a job board, but there will only be one job. So that's basically what I'll end up doing is just kind of set it up so that that's how it rolls through. Got it. So then she wants a separate form for registration for Monday night meetings. If they choose online during registration, they should get a link to a Zoom meeting. If they choose in person during registration, they should get a link to actually see that. So this is separate from doing the – so they've got – they're applying to this one pipeline. That's one thing. But then she wants a separate thing for them to be able to register for a meeting? Yeah, it sounds like it. And I was thinking I can have her do two separate profiles maybe. Well, because these wouldn't be – because the thing with a profile is the only way you can fill out a profile online would be while applying to the job. Oh, okay. You can't just put a profile on the web. Profiles have to be attached to a person. Now, you could do a custom form and have them fill that out. And I guess that still works. The only thing there is that now you're having people register twice because they're going to have to. They may fill out the one form and go into the database, and they may fill out the other form and also go into the database, because both of them are designed for adding a new person to the system. I don't know how the duplicate handling works in that regard, but as long as they're using the same name and email, I think it should function. Yeah. I mean, I imagine some people might be like, oh, here's my personal email for the Monday night meeting. and they get interested in working with them and then it's like, oh, well, here's my professional email for the – Is the Monday night meeting thing something that would only be useful to people who have applied? Can people register for the meetings without being in the database? Yeah, I think without being in the database is fine. I think that's like the – Because what I'm wondering is do you do the Monday night meeting thing as a profile that they get – And then when they so when they register, they get an email thanking them for registering. And that includes a link to the profile about the Monday night meetings that it's not on the Web site. It only gets to them if they have applied. That you could do, you know, OK. Yeah, I got to check with Kim again. I'm confused on what the Monday night meetings are. I think it might be like, let's invite a bunch of people to this meeting and hopefully we get a few out of that meeting to fill out our big form. of questions. Kind of like the outreach meeting in a way. But I might have that backwards. I could maybe check with her. Yeah. Because I mean, because effectively what we can do is two, sort of two different things. I mean, one is you do, let's see here. Let me look at the intake form thing. Because I haven't looked in their database yet. And you said there's already a profile of some sort going in there? Yeah. There's one profile called, I think it's just called Kim training and she just kept working on that one let's see what we got here kim training for training your kim ah okay...
