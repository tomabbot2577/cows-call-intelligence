## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, is this Fred? Yes, it is. Hi, Fred. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence, PC Recruiter. Hi, Robin. How are you? How are you? I'm good. So do we have a bad email for you? Yeah, I thought I had the Fred at FredAnthony.com there for years. I don't know why the other one popped up. Okay. Fred at Fred. I'm fixing this here. Fred at FredAnthony. Okay, I'm going to make sure I fix this going forward because anything we try to send to you is going to be a problem if we can't. Okay, Fred at FredAnthony.com. All right, so we got that part fixed. So you're having a problem getting into the portal? um yeah i use my uh username and my password and oh okay so the billing portal you have to click sign up it's not related to your pcr username and password at all um one because it's an external site but two also not everybody that even does billing is even a pc recruiter user. So in one of those invoices, I think I re-sent them. Do you have one of them? Yeah, I do. Hold on. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So they'll have like a link for the portal. When you go into that link, or even from my email, you'll first have to click sign up. okay i'll do that okay and then what you can do is then go in pay the invoices you can also do auto pay or if you want i could set up auto pay for you and then you could just do the sign up later if you want so nice about signing up for the account is if you ever you know need to change your card if you have one of those billing portal accounts there's once you sign up and then go into the site, there's a vault area to manage your card on file. So that way, like, you know, if it's going to expire or something like that, you can just kind of update it on your own. Well, let's set up auto paint right now. And then I'm on my way out. So I'll go on and set up the password later today. Okay. All right. So what is the name on the card? It's Fred W E I G A N D T. Oh, so Anthony is not even your last name, is it? No, Anthony is my stage name and the company name. Oh, okay. All right, because we have two Freds in here. One with the last name Anthony and one with W-E-I-G-A-N-T. Okay. And that one had the other email address. Okay. So that was not used for billing. Okay. I'm sorry, so Fred W-E-I-G-A-N-D-T is the name on the card? That's the name on the card. Okay, first name, last name. And then the card number? Card number is, hold on a second. It's 3795 Okay. 860 0825 100 0202. Okay, let me read that back to you. 3795-860-082-51002. Correct. Okay. Expiration? Expiration is, let me make this thing hard to read. I told you. 326. Oh, 326. And the security number? It is 664. Okay. What is the address on the card? 1-1-5-4 South Wells Street. Okay. Apartment 8, Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. Okay. 5-3-1-4-7. Okay, I'm going to add the card. And it's that number, right? 3-7-9-5-8-6-0-0-8-2-5-1-0-0-2? Correct. I'm reading right from the card. Okay, perfect. It just kind of seemed like a little short. Is that American Express? Yeah. Okay, that's why. Their grouping is a little bit different. That's why. Okay. Okay, so let me then turn on auto pay for you. We'll do it on due date. Okay, so there are currently three invoices. Actually, one of them has a late fee applied. Let me take that off for you. Okay, and one of them, I checked my American Express bill. The one dated 5-13 was charged to my American Express. Let me see on here. That might have been the April invoice, though. I know. It just came through 5-13 on my American Express. Yeah. Let's see. Yep. That was, there was a payment on 5-16 and that was for the April invoice. Okay. So what I'm going to do is take the late charge off the May one. So that was during the time I kind of, through the transition, we kind of had both. So our bookkeeper probably just applied one for the April invoice. but now we're strictly only on the new system. All the card stuff had to be re-entered. We couldn't, like, transfer it over. Okay, so there's three. Each one is 7823. I'll go ahead and process all three of these now, and then the account is current, and then you'll be set up in auto. You're now set up in autopay in our new system. Okay, I'm just looking at my American Express bill here, And the bill that I have in front of me is for June, and it shows 5-16-25 for 78-23. So you're saying that's for the April? That was for the 4-21 invoice. That was during the time where we kind of had access to both systems before the switch. So our bookkeeper probably saw the open one, tried to process the card. But now going forward, it all has to be done in a new system. Meaning that we had to put your card details in, because we couldn't. Yes, I'm showing that there's three open. Hold on one second here. Oh, wait a minute. Why is the one system showing that? Well, that's odd. Okay. I'm going to only process I guess these two. Where's the action list? Let's see. Okay. Alright, we're all set. As long as this goes through, you should get a ring. Yeah, I've approved it. Payment view. Why is th...
