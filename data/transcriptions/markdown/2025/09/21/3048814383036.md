## 💬 Full Transcript

 Tyler. Hello, Ms. Robin. Question for you. Are we doing people purchasing training hours any different now? Just no, not really. Just tag me. I'll make an invoice for you. And then I just kind of put a little reminder to myself to occasionally check and make sure they get paid. And then I let you know. Perfect. So the only difference is it's me generating the invoice and not Pat's here, Liz. Gotcha. Yeah, this person just emailed in that they want to schedule a training on setting up candidate applications, essentially like profiles. But they need to purchase training hours first. Okay. Setting up candidate applications. Yeah, they send them out. Job board. they send them out in form letters okay alright so it's not job board stuff for Drew nope yeah just whatever ticket tag me if I don't reply right away I'm usually pretty quick on those or just shoot me a message tag me in a ticket whatever and I will get it done well they do have the job board let me check out the website real quick because that shows that people word their requests and you're like, this is not what you asked for at all. Yeah. All right. All right. Just let me know. Also, who's the customer? HIP Workforce Solutions. because what i think is very helpful for me to know is if they've already like and i can tell you if they did but if they are set up for auto pay should i just go ahead and process it or do they want otherwise i could extend it like like 10 days or whatever yeah well the person that's HIP Workforce Solutions. Yeah, the person that's requesting it is the contract signer. So I'm just going to let them know. Oh, okay. Yeah, and they don't even have a stored payment. Why don't they have a stored payment? Invoices. Let me look up this. Oh, they pay annual, it looks like. yeah we would have to yeah just I would just set it like that they it would go to the billing email and then they'd have to put in a card it looks like they pay annually and it's what $95 an hour 95 an hour or 80 for 4 or more perfect alright thanks Robin no problem...
