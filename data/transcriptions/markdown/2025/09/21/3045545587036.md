## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Stormy. I am having trouble opening attachments instead of PCR underneath the global tab. Okay. Could be. Are you able to open up other attachments? Let me see if I can just go to the current record and open up. Yeah, absolutely. Because usually what that means is you have an issue with the Java launcher that are required to be installed on your computer. Any chance you're a new user or on a different new computer or did a big upgrade on your system? Honestly, I've been here for a year, and I haven't been able to open them for a while. I just thought it was a glitch and it was going to fix itself. Oh, okay. I'm sorry, sorry, what is your last name? Bryant, B-R-Y-A-N-T. Okay. Oh, you're a thread kite. Okay. It is probably a Java launcher issue. Do you happen to have RingCentral? I do. Okay. I'm going to start up a meeting, and I'm going to have you join. Okay. Let's see. Bear with me one second. Start. Okay. If you can open up your RingCentral app and go to video and then join. Video and then is it in, like, upcoming? meetings? It should be over at the right. I have start, schedule, and then join. But it'll be under upcoming meetings. There's like four icons at the top. Okay. So I'm going to give you a meeting ID and then when it tries to put you in, it'll ask you about joining with computer audio. Don't join with computer audio only because we're already on the phone. Otherwise, background interference. Okay. The meeting ID that you're going to put in is 050 394 810. Okay, join. Okay. All right, so you're in. And then what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of your screen click share. Okay. And then you're going to go over to where it says entire screen. Okay. Click on what screen to show. Okay. And then click share. share. Okay let's do this in your windows search area down at the very bottom and I might have to take you a couple ways because I never know if the version of Windows where it's found. Type in the word add ADD. Nope okay actually no That's the web version. Okay. Let's go to type in the word app, A-P-P. Okay. See where it says system settings at the very top? Yeah. Click that. This one? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let's go to apps over at the left. And go to installed apps. okay so let's see okay so don't have that okay cool let's go down they're going to be listed alphabetically let's go down to where it would have j i think starting with j we're gonna look for java that's okay all right let's go down to the p's i just installed java this morning because someone's like it could be your java and i was like oh okay and it's still not working Okay, let's go down. Yeah. Okay, I restarted it. Okay, so you don't have, so you got Java, but you don't have Peace Recruiter Launcher. Okay, you got to have both of them. They kind of work together. Okay, the launcher is what says open this up in Java. And okay, things like that. So okay, let's exit out of this window. And see over at the left of your database URL, where you've got like the circle, that'll just like reload the page. I'm going to get to your login page yeah right there that one yeah this one reload okay so don't log in yet once it's okay but see down at the very bottom left or says launch or install click where it says Windows so it's downloading up at the very top right of your browser and you're gonna okay go and click on that download icon click where it says peace recruiter launcher and you're going to see some a prompt says you want this okay you got that all right next I accept the terms and then next typical and then install now the first time that we log in we're going to see a couple extra prompts after this runs through. I'll talk you through those that way you don't get them every time you try to sign in. Okay. Okay hit finish. Okay so what I'm going to do is go ahead and sign into Peace Recruiter and this first time you're going to get again you're going to get a couple prompts here. Okay hit login. This is your browser wanting to know if it's okay to open that launcher which is open control. hit the always allow and then open then here click allow just because it's the first time that you're doing it so if you've been having an issue with the resume parsing screen popping up opening attachments receiving alarms it's going to fix all of that probably some other things too but those are the three most obvious ones okay go ahead okay I guess we're there so there's your alarms so if If you don't need the alarm, you would just hit Remove, and it would clear that one. And then you'd like it. You have four, it looks like. So the next time that it pops up, hit Remove on one, and then the next one. And then you can clear all those if you don't need those. OK, so let's try what you were trying to do before, and it should work. There we go. This one. Oh, yes, it did. Perfect. It opened up on my other screen, but yes. All right. You're all set. Thank you so much. You ar...
