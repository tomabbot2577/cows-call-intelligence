## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Hello, Paul. Do you hear me? Yes, I can. Can you hear me? I do. I do. I bet since you're on a phone, it probably overrode the call and just put you in the Zoom meeting. So I dialed into the Zoom meeting. That's no problem. Okay, so we're good to go. I can hear you. And at this stage, hold on, let me go back. How can I get out of this chat? Okay. Perfect. And you see my screen okay? Oh, I don't hear you anymore. Oh, you're muted. Okay, perfect, perfect, perfect. So this is PCRM. So this is the new interface, the new product here. It is going to run off the same database. It's just going to look a little bit different. So I'm going to go ahead and get logged in. And if you have any questions, just jump right in as we go. Can you hear me now? I do now. Yeah. Okay, good. I can hear you. still going to get me to all my people it's still going to show me the most recent number of people that I looked at each one of these records if I click their little circle icon there that'll slide it in from the right-hand side of the screen and that's going to give me my custom workspace I'm gonna see all my activities or my notes or what roll-up lists they're on or anything of that nature so I'm going to be able to look at all of their information and these tabs across the top that you see kind of replace the buttons at the top of the current PC recruiter the current PC recruiter record okay so okay um you're going to have a customizable workspace too so you can kind of design a basic workspace there so you can do that there but so same basic data just a little bit different format a little bit fresher of a format we've added some things like the ability to edit inline Hello? Okay, so I can go through and I can edit in line. I can contact them from here. I can add an activity, a note, add them to a roll-up. So the main screen is a little bit more configurable and interactive there. Okay. Some of the screens are going to look pretty similar, though. Like the schedule looks very similar. you're going to have your calendar at the top you'll be able to see any scheduled items on the bottom that's all going to look and work just the same but your roll-ups are going to look a little different so you're going to be able to look at the roll-ups here and I can see here's all my lists I can see names companies positions I can also click into any list right from there and then I'm going to be able to open the list right from there okay okay so those are going to look a little bit different now one thing that it adds is that deals pipeline it was mentioned on that pop-up when we logged in the deals pipeline is going to be almost like the interview pipeline you used to track interviews but it's going to let you put in a potential deals so you can put in various different companies that you might be working with and then you can move them through step by step as you're you're selling them you're closing the deal you're sending the contract whatever it might be and you can even schedule activities so if you wanted to put a call and then an email a couple weeks later, you can kind of set that up in that capacity. So you do gain... And that's automated from email? Excuse me, I'm going to interrupt as we go along, or do you want me to wait and then ask questions? Please jump right in. That's no problem. Okay. So at this stage, just so I understand, so when you're scheduling these, like the email, you can set up, write the email, and then schedule it to be sent on a specific day, and then it will automatically be sent? I think in this list, I don't think it's quite that automated. I think it just reminds you so you would go to it and then send the email there. That being said, you do have some sequencing automations. So you could design a sequence assigned to a roll-up list that would, as soon as you activated it, would send an email. And then maybe you could say three days later, send another email. and then if they reply to it, maybe add on my call list, but if they don't reply, send them yet another email in four days or something like that. So you do have the sequencing piece, so you could actually go ahead and build an email sequence in here. So if I go up to my templates, I can look at like this business development template here with branches, and I can go ahead and I can go pick my first form letter, and then I can say if they reply to it, they're done. if they don't interact in three days continue to the next step which is add them to a call list or maybe like if i make a call and leave a message that'll move to the next step which is another email so these sequences are going to be automated like drip campaigns and it might this one includes a call but they don't have to it could simply be send an email wait a week send another email wait two days, send a third, something like t...
