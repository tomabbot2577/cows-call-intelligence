## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling. This is Garrett. How may I help you? I'm sorry, you said Garrett? Yes. I'm having a tough time hearing you. Garrett, do you know Jared? Do you respond to him? Yes. He's no longer with the company. I understand that. I'm actually his uncle. I worked for the company for a while, but he's got an emergency situation and I need to get a hold of Gretchen. Do you happen to have Gretchen's phone number? I don't have Gretchen's number. Let me send you over to my supervisor, Nick. He might have more contact information for other people at the company. One second. Okay. Is Patsy in the office? Patsy's no longer with the company either. Oh, my. Okay. I'll take Nick. Yeah, one second. Let me see if he's available. Thank you....
