## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I am calling to see if you can help me with this. I'm trying to look for a report that could get me some data about my placements. And I keep running into some weird stuff. And so I thought I'd give you guys a call, see if I could save some time. Yeah, not a problem. So what type of information were you looking for? Well, I'm trying to run a report. Is it like a report that you already have in the database? Oh, well, I thought I did, but then when I run it, all the fields are not populated. So I'm trying to find out if my custom fields are working. I mean, you know, to be honest with you, I haven't really had a successful placement report yet. and I'm really confused about why when I do run a placement report, it's like it's duplicating all of the candidates in the end report. Anyway, so I just would like to kind of see if placement reports are going to be an answer to what I need at all or if I'm going to really need to focus on making sure that I create custom fields in position. Position reports run really well, but I'm really trying to get to – I want to be able to run a report on all my placements, like ever made every single search. I mean, we only have 232 completed searches, so we're not really high volume. But I do want to be able to run that kind of report. I can run a roll up. I mean, I can do a search and I can populate a roll up. But what I'm trying to do is get a report done. So at the end of every search that's completed, once we filled it and we place someone, we can send a report to an individual report to our accounting person to let them know this person's been placed. You can go ahead and invoice. There's a few custom fields in our placement window that we want to, you know, we've worked out a deal where they're going to get a bonus. you know, this kind of, that kind of information. And it's just like, I'm just, the only way I've been able to make it work is by creating a custom position report, not a placement report. So. Yeah. Let me pop in here and take a look. Now, which, which one were you running most recently? The placement report. um well like i said i haven't run a placement report that i use at all i've been trying i've been playing around with them i've created you can see in there i've created like five different custom reports yeah but i'm like i said i'm just trying to get to a place where when a search is filled and a placement is made we have a an admin who just you know runs a it's a custom position report that she's running right now. And if you want to, if we can run one real quick, you can see the data that it spits out about that specific search. Okay. So to give you the most recent, let's just go to a position ID number 25266. Oh, I guess we're just doing a report. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry. Let me look at the position too. I'll have that open. Okay, so 25266. And then you go to the placement. Open that window. And then you'll see that we have, you know, some of our fields are going to be, you know, from, you know, you guys, they're, I'm trying to think of what they're called. Whatever, standard fields that KPCR designed. predefined there you go and then i've created some myself um over on the accounting side so we don't use pcr for our all our accounting purposes and when we do clickbooks and whatever but i want the recruiter to capture the information that they have and sometimes you know starting salary is kind of you know it's the recruiter knows what the starting salary is the recruiter knows, as you see here, $18,525 was a bonus that was added on. And so we kind of do the math. We have the recruiter do the math and just plug it in here. So total cash compensation is the starting salary plus the additional guarantee compensation. And then they're supposed to take that fee percentage, do the math, and plug in the whole placement fee is $66,168. so one day I'm sure that we'll streamline that we don't have to have them always do the math but for right now they're just they're plugging in the numbers the recruiter is so when they when they fill all this out then the goal is to have our admin be able to to run a report and the way that we're doing it now is she goes to reports she's running a position report it's a closing position it's a custom position closing position accounting report I want to make sure are you following? yep okay cool and then selected we're doing it from a roll-up so the roll-up is going to be let's see what is she using closing she's using a roll up called closing underscore POS underscore reports you'll see that there's only one position in there at this moment yep so let me take a look all right for it. Okay. So you're kind of looking for that same information in a placement report or different information? Well, it would be ideal. I guess to me, I may misunderstand what placement report is because when I do run a replacement report with this specifi...
