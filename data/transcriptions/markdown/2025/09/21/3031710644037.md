## 💬 Full Transcript

 This call is being recorded. Please hold while I try to connect you. For Wealth, this is Gary. Hi, Gary. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hey, how are you? Good. You had an email question. I apologize because I... I wasn't sure if my message went through, so I called and talked to Mackenzie, and he was able to help me. Oh, okay. All right. Sure I'll handle it. Anything else? Well, you know, there is one thing that I, since you're here, perfect timing. So I had said the reason, one of the reasons I was talking earlier was I needed to send out a meeting request, which he helped me, but I need to amend the time. Is it easiest just to cancel that one and send out another one, or can you edit an existing? You would have to, well it would be on your PCR schedule, you would have to go to the PCR schedule to do an edit and then it would automatically update what they receive. So how do I go to the schedule? So there's a schedule option on the main toolbar. Yep. Do I have to have the client's name or just the schedule? If you go to the schedule you have to find the appointment. Yep. And then you click on it and select edit. Edit option, it's giving me a Where do I find the edit button? I'm so sorry. Oh my gosh. this is the season oh gosh allergies i'm so sorry about that so do you see the appointment on your schedule yep okay so when you click on it you still will pop up yep it says interview position name all account new account oh my gosh i'm so sorry um oh so you did this from an interview you know i don't know Let me do one real quick. I did it from the pipeline. Okay. Let me. I can pull up the meeting, but I don't see anywhere that says added. It just says. Okay. Let me see something here. Oh, there it is. Never mind. I'm sorry. I do it that way. I'm just trying to remember like where. I got it. That way. Okay. Okay, so then I should be able to check, just change the date. Yeah, that looks like it works. And then when you go and you edit that, then it should send that calendar invite. Now, you still need to change it in the pipeline. Okay. Thursday 11 okay so Thursday 11 Okay, so I've edited the meeting, so then I hit save. Yeah, let me make sure. I'm going to do, let's see. So if I go to schedule, I don't have one on my calendar like that. Okay, so if you go to, okay, so click on it from the schedule. You go to edit. You change like the date and time. That's what you're wanting to change, right? Okay, so let me change this to maybe the 29th. When I hit save, that should move it, but then it should also change on their calendar. Does it resend an alert? Yeah, it just kind of sends like an appointment updated type of option. You know, I never had hay fever. And then, I don't know, at some point I was doing something and exposed to grass for a long period of time. And then I had a horrible hay fever for about five years. I never had a problem until the past two years. And then it just went away. And I haven't had it for, it's been four or five years since I've even sniffled in the summer. So it's weird. It just was not. Then it was horrible. Then it was perfect again. So, okay, well, I see the edited on my schedule. So I'm assuming that I didn't get a message that said it was re-sent. Yeah, I believe it. Now, if you go to the recipient, whoever you had it was sent to, does it say in there like an email was sent? I believe the calendar invites you to just kind of update on their end too. Just a question. I'll just send them an email and just say I've updated the meeting. Yeah, I don't – I can't tell when it sends out a – all I got was last time just they accepted it, and then I could tell that it had gone out. but I don't think there was any way I could tell that it had gone out. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm assuming that worked. And then if I hear from them, I'll just ping them and say, hey, just make sure you saw the amended meeting request. So, okay. All right. Yeah. I believe that I've tried that before. By accident, I have someone where I don't have an email address on them, so they would not have gotten anything. But, yeah, I believe it automatically sends that. If you have others in the meeting, that it would include them. Okay. Okay, excellent. Well, I appreciate you following up. Thanks so much. All right. Thank you. Yeah. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
