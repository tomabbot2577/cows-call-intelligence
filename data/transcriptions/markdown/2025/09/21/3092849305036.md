Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Jay. Hey, Courtney, how are you? I am well. How are you? I am not too bad. You are living on the edge, my friend. Do you know why? Why? There was no reminder on this invite. Oh, no. Yeah. Luckily, I'm pretty type A, man. I knew about it, but I had reminded Heather as well. And she was like, oh, yeah, okay, no, I'll be up. Every time I see that, I'm like, how do we live? I don't know. It's okay. I'm glad that we got it. I was ready. I'm here. I said it like I always do. I don't know what happened. Yeah. Bear with me. I'm trying to quickly remove someone from our system. We had someone. This doesn't happen a lot, but evidently we just fired someone. and then he sent a uh company-wide email like a nasty gram company-wide email so i'm quickly removing him from oh no uh yikes yikes yikes um let me get out of here then excuse me hey henry i was just quickly removing someone from jaw batter and all the sort of things Yeah. Good. Smart. Nice. Nice, right? I feel bad for Kay. I don't know. I guess. I guess. So, Jim, are we going to be the only ones on camera? Do you want me to take myself off? I don't even have that up. Yeah, I don't go on camera usually. If you want to go on, go off, whichever. I'm not going to multitask, I promise. Someone said it was synchronous or something when like everybody's on or nobody's on or something else. We'll be in alignment here. That'll be good. I'm usually either taking notes or sharing my screen, so I don't usually keep it on. But yeah, so I want to show you the PC Recruiter a little bit. I wanted to first talk a couple minutes about what are you looking for? What are the main features, criteria, kind of what are the main things you need the software to do so I can make sure to kind of A, show you the right interface because we've got two now and B, kind of make sure to cover those as I show you around here. Amazing. Yes. Perfect. I've got a little spiel I will run through here. So we at Thinking Ahead, right, we did demo PFC Recruiter like a decade ago. We maybe almost went with it although at that time it was lacking some things i don't remember what they were right but um but it was uh so sorry uh let me text alani that yes uh yes uh cut off um sorry and so we we uh so we were a firm um we've been around gosh 35 40 years at the firm when I started here 20 years ago, by the way, we were using Outlook as our CRM. Then we had a proprietary system. And then we were on MaxTire for quite some time before MaxTire was purchased by Bullhorn. And then we went through a pretty thorough evaluation system 10, 11 years ago. And again, at that point, I connected with Brian and we looked seriously at we did go with jaw batter in 2015. And we've been on job at our sense for like a decade. Job batter is fine. Although what I will say is they have changed as a company, a decent amount in terms of they changed leadership a few times. Our point person has changed a number of times. And the last guy, quite frankly, I really, really liked. So it was just, it's just been a change. You know how, when you don't have a good point person, right? And so we've really started to wonder, is job adder really suiting our needs for what they are? What we feel like we're lacking with job adder, by the way, is the ability to do like sequencing campaigns, like email campaigns, automatic campaigns, or whatever you want to call it via the CRM. In addition to job adder, we do use Zoom Info as a company, a decent amount, a lot for data uh just data what am i looking for data lookup right like phone numbers emails but also so that's the way i use an info but many of our recruiters also use zoom info engage for those sequencing campaigns email campaigns it is a pretty big annoyance that those systems don't talk to each other the way we would like them to if that also makes sense um we have got 38 or 40 recruiters. We operate in 10 or 11 pretty different practice areas. Heather works on the nonprofit team. I work on the banking team, but we also kind of, we all, all of the recruiters operate in a standalone desk environment. We do often work together as a team on select assignments. As a company, we're headquartered in Nashville. The majority of our recruiters are remote. We do about a third to a half retainer engaged. The rest is contingent search work. We don't do any contract placements. I will say as a rule, the kind of CRMs that we gravitated toward last go around and the kind that we will gravitate toward are those that operate and work well with a, you know, we consider ourselves a boutique executive search agent, right? So like anything just like placement services or just email campaigns only, right? Those don't tend to align with our values incredibly well. And we do like and do like jo...
