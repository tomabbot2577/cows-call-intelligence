## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Mark Dillon from NADEC. How are you doing today? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Question for you. I have a second home up in the Adirondacks. I have my computer that I have all set up with PCR on it. And I was trying to, for whatever reason, my RingCentral is not connected to this one. How do I get it connected so that I can, you know, just when I click on the little phone icon, it can dial a name for me? Do you have their app installed on that computer? Yes, I do. Okay. Let's see. So what's happening, because it should still stay connected, because really the connection is kind of pulling from the logs. Is the problem the click to dial? Yes, not doing anything when I click on it. It doesn't, whereas like if I'm at my office and I click on it, you see the RingCentral little box pop up and start making the phone call. Is it a different computer? Say that again? Is it a different computer? Yes, it is. This is a different computer. okay we probably should do a screen share can you open up your ring central app and go to video and then select join okay I'm looking at text video click on video okay okay and then go over to join or join okay and then it's going to ask you for a meeting ID yep go ahead 050-394-810. Okay. And you don't have to join with computer audio. If you did, just mute yourself. Otherwise, you're going to get a little background noise since we're already on the phone. Okay. And then let's have you click share at the bottom of your meeting screen. Got it. And go over to entire screen. And then you'll have to click on this screen to show me. And then click share. It goes select tab. Now you'll have to, so go to entire screen first. Share. Yeah. Entire screen, got it. Okay. And then click on which one to show in case you have more than one. Okay. Yeah, so this is my PCR share. Okay. Show me your RingCentral app. All right, so the RingCentral is here. Okay, I wonder if that's just... I don't think you're joined through the app though. Like if you type the word ring, so if this is kind of like their web version, we can't integrate with that. It has to be the one you download to your computer. Can you, in your Windows search area, can you type the word ring? All right. Hang on. All right. So down here, just ring. Okay. All right. And I guess you can't see this. If I move it on this side, you can see that. So it's a Windows search option at the very bottom left of your computer. Yep. And that is, yeah, that's where, so when I hit ring. Hit the word ring. There it is. That's just taking you to their website. Okay. So let me get the link. You'd have to download their app because that's the one that we would integrate with. So let's see, RingCentral. Yeah, you'd have to go to RingCentral downloads. Right here, download. Can you see what I'm looking at? You know what? Go to their – let me see. What is the link? There's one page I prefer to go to because I see everything. This is www.ringcentral.com. Yeah, but I want to make sure it's giving you the right one. Exactly. Go to that page that says download. Let's see what's on there. Right here? No, go to just below that. Download the app? But I want to see which one it is. Maybe just try their download page. Otherwise, I'll just let me give me a moment. I'll look for the URL that you usually go to. OK, so it does download app, right? Or download. Hold on one second. I don't know which one it is. I know there's a page that has like they're different ones. I just want to make sure we're going to the right one, though. Where did I? Oh, because I've made it in a group. Downloads. Here we go. What is it called? Okay, can you replace the bar at the top, the search? Replace that with support.ringcentral.com slash download.html. okay you want the one that says download for PC yeah hit it yeah I feel like sometimes when people go other places they get something different that's why I just wanna make sure we get it all right and I mean yeah for sure on that so just so quick on it I know I think that's something else go back to your downloads it looks like it said that the download was blocked download for PC right yeah well it's already down look well see over at the top right it's kind of like grayed out right now up by where you would have your just below that right next to your picture unverified download block so somehow you have your computer restricting downloads where where is that just to the left of your picture Right there. It disappeared, the little circle. Want me to search it and see if it pops up in my search thing? It's probably in your downloads folder. So if you go to, like, your file folders, go to your downloads folder. Otherwise, it seems like you have some kind of safe browsing turned on or something. Oh, what the heck. From what it sounds like. But you'd have to download and run that file to set it up so they can recognize. Right, I can just go to apps, RingCentral. Well, it's not ...
