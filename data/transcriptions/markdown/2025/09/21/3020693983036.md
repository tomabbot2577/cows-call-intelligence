## 💬 Full Transcript

 Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi Teresa, is Kathy available? Yes, just a minute Robin. Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Robin? Yes. Can you hear me? Hold on. I have no sound. Is it me or you? Are you there? Yeah. Can you hear me? Hold on just a second. Can you hear me? okay i should have sound now can you hear me there yes yes thank you oh okay between you and me my headset i don't know who's what i have a problem that might have not been done right or whatever i don't know there's something you did because i can't remember if i asked you and i'd have to go through all my notes but I'm like just trying to get things through things quick right now can you in QuickBooks look up WJ I'm sorry JWP strategic let me get there I don't think I adjusted that invoice on my own. I can't say that I... Say again, what's the name? W-J? JWP. And I'm going to bring up their cancellation ticket, see if I can find that. Okay. cancellation effective 8-1-2025 yeah so occurring set to end 7 30 somehow for their july 1st invoice i guess they must have been invoiced for two i'm trying to like look through everything but they basically they paid for two it looks like invoice payment invoice payment invoice payment And it should have been one user, but then there's this row for 710 created by QuickBooks Online to adjust balance for deletion. I think something. Because it says that the invoice on 7-1 was $88.66. Yeah. And they paid $191.05. Yeah. So the balance does say $88.66. Let me look at the payment. So I don't know if I fixed it and didn't really look at the payment maybe. Hold on. It's got something added weird. So let me. Because basically he's looking for the amount refunded back. Let me check the payment and see if it really did charge that. Because the invoice of that extra is on 710. after the payment was made. So it doesn't seem to me like that would actually have charged that amount. Let's see. And the client is deleted, so I have to reactivate it or I can't see it. Okay. Bill or Jeannie, so hold on just a second. I'll make it active. and it could be that QuickBooks in its stupidity made that change after we went to go inactive yeah this thing does some weird stuff I wouldn't expect it to sometimes I remember Patsy always said Patsy would always tell me it's quirky I'm like, why is it doing this? It's quirky. Well, sometimes it's quirky because people are quirky. I'm quirky. That is very, very true. Sometimes it's quirky because people are quirky. But right now it's trying to use a lot of AI stuff, and we're finding that we're not happy with it, just to be honest. So it looks like there was a payment on 6-1, And then it does say 7-1. The payment was $191.05. Okay. And that was approved. So I would – let's see. I'm going to delete the 7-10 invoice that actually QuickBooks created. That's weird. QuickBooks created that on its own. It does say created by QuickBooks. Okay. And I'm going to delete this. So then the refund would be $102.39. That does end up. See, that's the weird thing is why would it have filled $191.05 when the only – was it – oh, no. Because the only invoice that was open on 7-1 was $88.66. Unless I went in and modified the users – after it really already processed. That could be what happened. Well, let me look at the invoice. And I'm going to look at the audit history. And see what exactly happened. Okay, let me see my notes. I was on I'd so okay it was not till August this started a long time ago rich um no well that wasn't me so you edited it on 7-1 which is the day that it was creating the invoice and okay let's see if it didn't say when remaining Oh, okay, yeah, here are some notes. Yeah, we did switch billing system so you need to add your card details for the first invoice from the new system. You've done this already so you're all set. You will have invoices dated 6-1 and 7-1 remaining, so this is back in May before the cancellation. I made sure the recurring invoices will end before the 8-1 cancellation date. Are you still at two users for the remainder of the agreement. I'm not using this system and I don't think they did either. We do have to bill for the remainder of the contract but I can lower it to one. You would appreciate that. And yeah, so probably on May 9th I would have lowered it to one user. yeah he paid for the June invoice was $85 so he paid $85 on June 1 because it went by credit card directly from Biller Genie and then on 7-1 it was $88.66 but it filled you know what it had been maybe the recurring was still at $177.31 that could be and then $88.61 Nope, it's $88.65 different. So, yeah, I'm not sure. But I can refund the $102.39 if that's what needs to happen. Yes, that's what needs to happen. Okay. Okay. So, let me. I think I have to do that. And I got most of those other ones. Never mind. Let me do that first. See a customer. jwp history refund 102 39 and i'll um the email is the jeff at jwp right yes yes Yes. OK. And I'll do that. Jeff at JWP Search. And h...
