## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. Hey, I am trying to use Capture on my PCR, and it's not working. So I'm thinking maybe I have to update it, but I'm not sure how to do that. When you go to the extension icon, the Manage Extension icon, it's like a black puzzle piece kind of at the top right. Hold on a second. There's a black puzzle piece. Yeah, tap right of your browser. Okay. Hit that. Click on that and go to Manage Extensions. Okay. Okay. And? Okay. Do you see PCR Capture listed as an extension? No, it just says access online forms, Google Docs, offline maps, directions, and PCR capture. Okay, so you do have PCR capture listed. Oh, yeah, yeah, I do. Okay, click details on that card, and what is the version number? 1.2.2. Okay, so that is the correct one. where it says pinned to toolbar. Is that turned on? I'm looking for that. Where's that at? So when you're in the details about the extension? It says on. The very top thing. So then you should be seeing your capture extension at the top right. It's a blue, green, and purple type of hexagon? No. I'm on a screen that just says PCR capture and it has on. Okay. So that was your managed extension screen. Now, next to, because if it says pinned to toolbar, right by that managed extensions icon, do you see the PCR capture extension? No. Do you want me to go back into it? Okay, so pen toolbar is on in that screen that I had you go into, right, with the details about capture? Here, let me, I'm going to turn it off, and then I'm going to turn it on. It says developer mode. Okay, so on the card that says PCR capture, you should have a details option, right? No. Okay, so when you click directly on your manage extensions icon. Well, here, let me go back. So I'm here. I'm under extensions. I'm under PCR capture 1.2.2. So I'll go into details. Well, first of all, it says service worker inactive underneath there. So you're, I think I'm wrong here. So at the very top right of your browser, you have the manage extensions icon, that black puzzle piece. When you click directly on that, do you see PCR capture listed? Yes. Okay. And is it pinned? Yes. Okay. So right up by your manage extensions black icon, you should see our extension icon. It's a blue, green, and purple hexagon. Right. Okay. Click on that. Click on that. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Is it connected to a database? Like what do you see? Do you see like a bunch of LinkedIn sites listed or is it asking for a URL? No, I see LinkedIn sites listed and it must be logged in because it has, you know, it's in basic mode, dark mode. Okay, so are those gray or those blue where it says basic mode, dark mode? Gray. Okay, so that's good. So when you go to somebody's LinkedIn page, you have to actually be in their profile. That's when it's popping up over at the right. Yeah, and it's not. And it just, this just started, like, I don't know, a couple days ago, which is weird. Okay. And I can't even do it on my laptop either. It's not working. Okay. Probably best we do a screen share. I'm sorry, what is your name? It's Jodi. And what is the last name? Knight. Knight. Is that with a K? Jodi Knight with a K? Yeah. Pinhook? I'm sorry. Yeah, pinhook. Okay. I'm going to send you a meeting invite. Okay. Or like a meeting link. I'm sorry. Sorry. I don't need to do it as an invite because we're not scheduling it for later. Where are you sending this? On my email? Yes. Okay. Let me get rid of... Okay. Okay, so Google Meet. Okay, so in that, you'll click on the link that I sent you. I did, and it says download Chrome or Firefox or Edge. It should recognize that you have a browser. What browser do you use? This is Safari. Okay, you'll have to, yeah. Do you have Chrome? You'll need to go over to Chrome. because if you're in Safari and on LinkedIn, you won't be able to use Capture. You have to be in – if you were in Chrome where that extension is, you have to go to somebody's LinkedIn page in Chrome, so that could be why it's not popping up. No, I'm in Chrome. When I'm doing the LinkedIn, I'm in Chrome. I just don't have my – hang on a second here. You're going to have to bear with me.
