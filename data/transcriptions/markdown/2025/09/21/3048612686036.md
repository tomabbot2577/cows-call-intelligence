## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hola. Howdy, Robin. I was on the phone when I saw you called. Okay. This is a ticket from Tino. I don't know if you got one, and I remember you walked in. It stars an agreement. I don't even know if I – You're next or Nick, Eric? We still need to put the new agreements. You or Nick? Mostly me. I do 95% of them. Okay. Can you go to ticket 102-253? Yeah, I got that. That came to me late yesterday. Yeah. New client. So this is Judy Walcott's office, WorkLink. Okay. So she's got two databases, WorkLink and this Tendergrass. So it sounds like Tendergrass is a person and company whatever that maybe she's just giving the database over as a new one. So I assume we would need something signed off by Judy. Yes. but I don't see a form in there. Yeah, we don't. Yeah, so what we need to do, we do need to create a contract, get his database created, but we'll also need sign-off from Judy. First. Yeah, well, yeah, we can get them signed and paid and create a contract, but we could do that before Judy, but we should probably get Judy signed off to make sure that she's cool with it. So what do we send her? Is there anything in PandaDoc? I've made them in PandaDoc manually, just thrown together a little signature that says, I, Judy Walcott, authorize the transfer of this name database to this person, and then I throw in a little signature page for her. So I've made them for people, or we just tell people we need something that just says, I, Judy Walcott, authorize the transfer of this to that person, and then just sign it. So if you know how to do that, can you do that for Judy and submit to Judy? Yeah, because I've done it. It doesn't take long. Okay. And then for this person, I guess we need a contract 250 setup fee, two users for $100 a month. Okay. So that would need to be a contract analytic sequencing PCR mail contract temp. Yes. that would be a contract which i can also that so that would be i assume one year yeah okay and then what else on here and i guess no training they would have to list that right because then that's there isn't that spots in a thing it is tino i think does his own training so he might be charging only the 250 setup fee for us and then charging them a separate training fee for himself to train him on his own okay that's kind of something he does separately so we just we just need the 250s for us to set off the database okay um i would ask you know if there's any training just to confirm okay because we'd want to charge more than 250 for giving them training yeah okay yeah i can send that once i found out if there's training okay can you confirm if there is training provided by us because then we need more for the setup fee right yeah should be more Yeah, so I can send Judy kind of a sign-up. I'll call her, too, because I signed her up. But I think he probably knows her from MRI. Okay. Okay, so we would need the dates or whatever. And you just kind of do the dates, like, whenever you generate it. Is that how you do it? Mm-hmm. Okay. And then this David Marin, I did start him in PandaDocs as a recipient. Okay. I did start that part. And then I got to the part of the actual contract, and I'm like, oh, gosh, I don't remember. I remember there was like, I think you had to pull in the block of stuff. I just didn't remember how to do it. Yeah, I can do it easy. Yeah. I have one that I just found out. Okay. Could you take a look at a contract and see what you think or if it's a screw-up? The company name is Integra Partners. They're in MySQL, and they have a contract. Oh, Ag OneSource? Oh, they've been a customer a long time. Well, they're canceling. Oh. And they're going to Crelate. but their contract says the initial term was June 1st, 2023 through December 1st, 2024. I don't know why they have an 18-month contract, but further down the contract it says it's a 12-month contract, a one-year agreement. So I don't know because he says he wants to keep PC Recruiter open for the remainder of the contract while the change goes through, but he thinks it goes through December. But I don't really know when it's going to happen. Oh, I don't know. You would think it should be June 1st of 2024. Yeah, and he signed on June 1st. But for some reason, it went through December. I'd say it's June. I'd say it's June, too. Because it says one year, and he signed in June, so that would be until next June. I have no idea. Is there a place that says it's an 18-month contract? Because that's what that would be. Nowhere. It's just it could have been that somebody meant to put 6-1-20-24 and they put 12-1-20-24. Yeah. Let's see. Liz did it. I think it's a Liz group. I think that happens sometimes. It happens everywhere. We all have been. Trust me. I've missed quite a few things. Yeah. So I think he's going to throw that in and we'll figure it out because I didn't tell him that. So we'll let him know. But yeah, he's leaving us. And he was very kind about it. He's like, we have no ill will. It's just the Krelate is, their AI is ...
