## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I was just having a little trouble with PC capture working. Sure. What's your name and what company are you with? Ian Horstead, R&P Group. Okay. Perfect. All right. So what issues are you having with the capture tool? When I click it, it doesn't pop up to add the record. Okay. Are you on LinkedIn or a different website? Okay. Go to the top right of your browser and click on the LinkedIn logo there in your extensions list. And does it show you a list of websites with toggles next to it, like LinkedIn and Indeed, or is it asking for a PCR web address? It shows the links. Okay, that's good. And then down at the bottom right, is basic mode turned off and to the left? Yep. Okay, good. All right. And then are you currently on a LinkedIn profile right now, pulled up? Yeah. Okay. Try hitting refresh on that page and see if the click to add button appears. Yep. Did that work? Yep. Okay. Yeah, sometimes there are so many elements on the page that need to load that the PCR capture tool eventually just times out and doesn't fully get to load. So usually we just say hit refresh and it should fix that. Yeah, it's doing the same thing as before. When I click to add, it's just the PCR logo is shaking like it's doing something, but it's not. Oh, okay. Usually that happens when basic mode is turned on. That's interesting. And you said for sure basic mode is turned off up in that menu that we were just looking at? Yes. Okay. Okay. Let's jump on a screen share here. Let's see. Go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And I have a meeting ID if it's prompting you for one. Okay, that's 363-238-067. Perfect. You can click the mute button at the bottom left so there's no echo, and then click the blue share button down at the bottom. and select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. Awesome. I can see that. All right. Yeah, I see it's just kind of dancing there. Let's try this. If you go to the three dots at the top right of your browser and go to Extensions, Manage Extensions, And let's toggle off some of these extensions that aren't the PCR capture tool just to see if they're interacting poorly. So, yeah, just turn off some of those. And, yeah, maybe do that. Just the Google Docs everybody has, so that one's fine to stay on. But everything else, yeah, is good to turn off. Okay. and then we'll jump back to LinkedIn and just hit refresh on this page again okay good and then click to add still just loading yeah it usually goes quicker than that okay sums up go back to that icon at the top right, the PCR next to that puzzle piece. Perfect. Database match. Let's have you maybe log out and log back into the capture tool. So go ahead and click log out. And that's good. Oh, wait. PCR group.com, PCR bit. Okay, so it looks like you're self, are you self-hosted user? Okay, awesome. Go ahead and log back in. I think I did PCR last time. Try the other one maybe? Oh yeah, this one looks, it looks right, like you have the right web address there. Yeah, let's see if that helps at all. Click to add. No, yeah, still something's off. I'm not sure if the, let's see, if the capture tool, if there's some compatibility issues with self-hosted that we aren't aware of. Maybe, here, I might have to make a ticket. Let's try it all. Yeah, we can. I was just going to say we can uninstall, reinstall. And then also we can try updating Chrome to see if you have the latest version of Chrome. Yeah, download the PC or capture. Perfect. All right, and then, yeah, click there to re-enter your PCR web address there in that field that's kind of just placeholder text currently. Do you have PCR open in a new tab? You can just copy and paste that. Oh. Yeah, let's see if that works, that web address there. And then actually click the little puzzle piece there at the top right of your browser. We just got to pin the capture tool so it stays up at the top right. There we go. Then click on that capture icon and paste in your web address. Oh, there we go. Yeah. Can't change it for some reason. Are you able to paste over top of that? Uh-uh, I can't. Oh. Yeah, the placeholder text won't go away until you either type or start pasting. Like that? It looks like it's kind of frozen on my end. Try closing out this latest tab you opened. And it might be that the central, there we go. Okay. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah. If you put your cursor in there and hit paste into the web address field, does that do anything? It seems like you got frozen again. It might be that you have too many tabs open for the RingCentral meeting to continue to share your screen. If you have any in there that you want to get rid of, maybe. Okay, yeah, I can see your screen moving around again. Okay, that works. So yeah, just click on that capture logo again at the top right. And if you put your cursor on like the H in HTTPS and type anything on your keyboard, it should overwrite that ...
