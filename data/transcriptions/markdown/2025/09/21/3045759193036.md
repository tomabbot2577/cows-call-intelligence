## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Carl. Good afternoon, Carl. This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Who's the name? This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I got an inquiry from you the other day. Hey, Jim. How are you doing? I'm pretty well. I'm pretty well. I wanted to kind of check in. I got your note from our website. I wanted to give a call, see how I could help. Yeah, so I have a lot of history with PC Recruiter. I worked at a company for 15 years and they use it. And then I went on to another company and I introduced them to it. And they implemented PC Recruiter. And now they use it for their hiring on a pretty big scale. And then I moved back to the company I was before, and they used PC Recruiter. But I'm also doing some independent work myself. And I tried a database. I'm not really happy with it. Because I have such familiarity with PC Recruiter, and I like the newer, you know, the newer look that's more similar to the CRMs that are out there, you know. Oh, yeah. The PCRM piece? Yeah, where you move them through the pipeline and all that stuff. I watched your video, and I thought, yeah, this looks pretty cool. And, you know, I'm looking more for a database just for me for when I find candidates that I might use between the various companies I work for because I have a couple of different agencies that I work for. And these would be, you know, my candidates. You know, if I find them on LinkedIn or someplace and they're in my database that I can use for whatever. And I don't really have that right now. so um but i don't need the full version of pc recruiter that you have so it seemed like it might be a a good idea so i wanted to find out a little more you know cost and setup and you know i you don't have to convince me that it's a good product like i said i've got 30 years and using it so for sure for sure well yeah so um yeah you could so if you didn't think you needed like the email campaigns and the sequences and the analytics reporting, which if it's just you, you probably really wouldn't need any kind of reporting and maybe not like sequences or anything like that. You could do kind of the enterprise package of PC Recruiter, which is just 95 bucks per month per user, and it's 500 to set it up. So that one is our enterprise package. I'm not going to pay $500 to set up the program. You advertise that you have a program that's left, but that's the same price as if you were using enterprise. I don't want that. I thought you had more of a simpler one. Well, we do. Well, actually, the normal setup is $750. So that $500. But that being said, if you've used PC Recruiter before... I paid $250 two years ago to set up the program. I was going to say that. I was going to say, if you've used it before, I'm not charging you $500 setup. You wouldn't need a lot of training. I can even do it for $200. so we could do 200 set up. That just covers creating the link. They throw a couple hours in there, training, if you need it. But that would kind of be a real basic set up of the database, so you'd have that. And it would have the new pipeline there. Were you talking about our new PCRM product? Have you seen that at all? That's the CRM piece, which is that new, not the top to bottom, the left to right? I think that's what I saw and what I was interested in. Let me bring up – let me open up PC Recruiter in general and look at – let's see. PCRM, yeah, I was looking at that. That's right, yes, the PCRM. So the PCRM, yeah, that's our newest product. That one, I could do that for $200 set up and $95 a month and get you the brand new PCRM, the new pipeline, and everything like that. That actually does have some of the advanced features, the premium features, but we could do that if you were looking to get set up that way. I don't really want to pay the set up fee. All the other companies that I work with in C, you just pay a monthly fee. I understand your program pretty well I actually was an administrator for it and the setup fee that you're charging is literally just money just money you guys are going to take there's no setup I don't do it so I don't know what all they need to do they're just charging an extra $200 because they want the money this does look a little bit different I get that, but I'm just an individual. I'm just, you know, I'm willing to pay a monthly fee for it, but to have you pay you for a setup for something that all you really got to do is, it's in the cloud. You create a link. I'm pretty technical, pretty knowledgeable. I've worked with Andrew at your company on a lot of technical things when I was working at my other company. and you're charging for something just because you can. And I don't have the budget for that. I'm an individual. That was the reason I was interested in finding out. Well, let me tell you what I can do. What I can do, let me, I don't really ever do this, but let me do no setup if I can do a $1.15 per user per month, the list price of what it is for the PCRM. If I can do your list pr...
