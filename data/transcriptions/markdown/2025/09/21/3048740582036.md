## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound, otherwise just You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning, this is Jim. Good morning. Oh, Hans, do you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you just fine. Excellent, excellent. Sometimes Zoom puts me in under mute initially, but not today. Fantastic. So, yeah, so I wanted to show you around, and I did get your RFP. I can take a look at that and fill that out later today, if that would work. Of course. Perfect, yeah, so I'll kind of go through there. So I wanted to show you around a little bit around PC Recruiter a little bit today. I wanted first to talk a bit about kind of main needs. What are your main requirements in a software package? What are the main things you really want to see? So I can make sure to cover those as we look through here. Yeah, so let me kind of give you an idea of what it is that we're looking at. So I'm not sure if we're going to have Maggie from my team on board. She might be busy with somebody right now, but I'll be more incapable of taking care of this myself. So Maggie is the person that's going to be using this the most from our company. So just to give you kind of a rundown, we are a plastic surgery clinic located in the U.S. We have multiple locations throughout the U.S. We're at 13 right now. And we have a lot of things in place on the HR side of the house for staffing. Right. So we use Paylocity and we use a whole, you know, a couple of other softwares, et cetera. But that is specifically on the HR side for staffing. So mostly it's there for the regular agent staffing needs. So our agents on the phone and, you know, et cetera, et cetera, our IT departments, anything you can think of that goes to our regular HR group. Maggie, on the other hand, is a solo person here who is in charge of recruiting and hiring just for our doctors and our CRNAs, which those are the anestheticians, in a sense, that are putting you to sleep during surgery. Okay. And that's a very, very, very different set of rules and things in place for that than HR. So our HR team at Meaesthetics doesn't handle that. It's only done through Maggie. I know that she uses very different methods to look for doctors and CRNAs. For doctors, I know she uses Doc Cafe or Doximity, if I'm not mistaken. For CRNAs, she uses a program or a company called Gas Work, which makes sense, right? The gas for everybody. But that's one of the locations. So the thing with us is we do get a lot of doctors that want to work for us. Just word of mouth at this point, we do get doctors that want to come work for us or see our needs, but we're not in all locations. We've got 13 locations company-wide, you know, just all across the U.S. Some doctors might be interested in joining us, but they want to work out of Ohio or California or a location where I yet to have a location. So we currently keep a database. Maggie is doing that, but she's doing it manually. So, I mean, she legitimately has notebooks of information or Excel documents with information. But as you can imagine, over the course of three years, it's a lot of information to have to dig through when you're looking for something or looking for a specific CRNA that's available on certain days, et cetera, et cetera. So what we're looking for is a platform that's going to make this easier for her. So a platform that can help with getting all the information together, helping with follow-ups and updates and keeping conversations together. So in some of these, we've noticed that it's able to retain emails and retain text messages and retain follow-ups and notes and everything on the one platform, which makes it extremely easy. Workforce management would be great if the system has it. So example with doctors less so because they do operate on a traditional Monday through Friday. The CRNAs don't. Some CRNAs are literally only available to work Wednesday and Friday every other week. And another one might be only able to do Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday once a month. And so we have to be able to categorize that kind of what location are you willing to travel or not to our different locations. And if you're not, what are the dates you can work? Because it's extremely difficult to hire CRNAs in today's state. Right. So it's more of like a, you know, that's kind of like a big end of what I'm looking for. A suite that's capable of handling all this kind of information and assisting with the hiring. Sure, okay, excellent. Yeah, so we are going to be something that would allow for that. So, PC Recruiter is going to allow you to track all of your candidates, pretty much everyone you're talking to. You can create different lists within the system. You can track follow-ups, notes on your conversations, activities. You can put it on a calendar if you need it. And then you can also put in custom fields and areas showing when they're available, what locations they can work at, anything l...
