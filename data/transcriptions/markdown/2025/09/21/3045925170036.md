## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi Robin, yeah this is Nick. I'm just calling in because I'm having issues like uploading this CSV file to PCR. Never had issues like this before and I've done this so many times. Okay. What is it? When you go to select the file in advance or, because there could be a few things. What is happening? I'm trying it again right now. I'm hitting the lightning bolt. I'm pressing name, import list, and then uploading a CSV. Okay. Anything odd about the name of the file? I know I've seen lists where if it said, and I'm sorry, what is your name? Nick. I mean, it says AJ's, so there's like an apostrophe in it. That's exactly what it is. Okay, let me just call this AJ Holorun, and I'll see what we can do about that. Yeah, as I say, certain characters will certainly cause an issue, and apostrophe is definitely one of them. I've run into that before. Okay, let me try it again, Robin. One moment here. Let's see if this works now. Oh, there we go. Just like you said. Okay, I should be getting that, Robin. Yeah, it depends like where it is. Sometimes if it's at that early stage, it's the file name. Sometimes when you advance further, it could be because maybe you have like, say like first space base name. But yeah, definitely the file name. And I'm so sorry because I know we have you listed as two different companies. Are you Ferrara or Craft? Are you calling in as? yeah i i called a while back and tried to cancel out everything regarding ferrara group ferrara group's like no longer a company my company got bought out by craft um so if ferrara group's even still around it it definitely shouldn't be i've already called and canceled everything yeah that's showing active okay i'm going to change this how this is set up here canceled because you did like a database move and everything too, right? Or no? Yeah, I mean, I literally called in and made a final invoice and canceled out my account. Like I don't even have access to the email for Ferrara. Right. You guys are still sending stuff? Yeah. Okay. No, I just need to clean up a little bit here. Okay. I'm going to make Ferrara Group. Yeah. I think there was just one thing that I needed to change here that wasn't done. Canceled. Okay. Now with craft services. Okay. Yeah, just one thing was overlooked. Perfect, Robin. Thank you so much. Oh, you are welcome. Have a good day or have a good weekend. You too. All righty.
