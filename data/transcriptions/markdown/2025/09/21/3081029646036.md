## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling Grice Group in Cary, North Carolina. If you're trying to reach Grice Whiteley, we'll try and connect you to Grice by ringing his office phone, as well as his mobile phone. In case Grice is on a call already, it will allow you to wait up to 60 seconds on hold for Grice to finish it up and switch to your call. If he's not available or can't switch over to your call, it will allow you to go to voicemail. Thanks for calling, and please hang on a moment. Let's jump on a screen share call. Okay. We'll have you just go to a new tab in your browser. Yeah. That is, let's see, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, meetings.ringcentral. Okay. And is it prompting you for a meeting ID? Yeah, it's a meeting. Perfect. That is 1-866-513-022. Okay, 1-865-13022. Fantastic. It's wanting me to open RingCentral. I mean, I use that as my phone system anyway, so. Oh, yeah, that's fine. You can either do that or keep it in the browser, whatever is easiest for you. All right. That's good. All right. Yeah, we're in the meeting now with you. Do you want me to hang up and let's just do this audio thing through the meeting or do you want me to stay on the phone with you? We can hang up. That works. Let me make sure it's working and okay that you can actually hear me in there before I do because my computer had to reset. I had an internet problem yesterday. Okay. I'm hearing an echo, so I'm hearing you through the meeting. I don't know if you're hearing me through the meeting. Okay. I'll mute and then I'll – Yeah, I can hear you. You're a little bit farther away sounding on the video part, but can you hear me? That's all right. Maybe we'll just mute the video and then we could just stay on the phone if that works. But I think you might be muted. Better now? Yeah. Now I can hear it. Yeah, that works. Okay. So I'm going to just let you do it this way. Use the phone and the meeting, I guess. Perfect. And then in the RingCentral meeting, just click the blue share button down at the bottom yeah and select your entire screen up at the top okay I got a two screen set up oh I guess yeah we could drag things over to whichever screen you choose to share yeah that'll work okay cool I can see you have ring central there yeah let's start by taking a look at your outlook setup with PCR the PCR Outlook portal so you want to open up Outlook and bring it to this screen here perfect all right and then start by going to the options button up at the top it's a green wrench under it's under the PC recruiter tab yeah yeah yeah right there perfect and then let's see says grace group and has your username that looks pretty good uh hit test connection up towards the top left there all right that's good okay hit okay and then um in the middle go to auto activities it's the third tab kind of right in the middle there yep okay okay and that has your email address selected that is good uh hit save and close at the bottom right. Okay. Okay, so that is connected up. It should just be automatically scanning everything. Do you have multiple email addresses that you're signed into inside of Outlook? Not that, I mean I've got a separate account that's like my personal emails in Outlook. This is whitely.vt.edu but I like sending stuff through Grice group is just like just that one. I've got multiple addresses where stuff can kind of come into somebody and it forwards it to Grice at Grice group, but everything is out from Grice at Grice group. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah. And it looks like Grice at Grice group was the one selected in the settings we were just looking at up at the top. So anything sent or received from there should be recording. Yeah. This is all this personal email stuff. Like just, you know, like whatever, just signing up for, you know, an airline ticket or something like that. Right. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay. And then let's go back to PCR as well, if you want to open that up. Oops. Let's see. Okay. I think it's actually running because I was, let me redo this. I was on my laptop because I had to go work off site yesterday. So let me log back in. Okay, and then go to the gear icon at the top right of the PCR, yep, and go to email underneath that. Okay. That'll open up PCR mail here, perfect. And we'll go to configure at the top left. Okay. And then go to mail servers right below that. Okay. Okay, so it does list two mail servers. One of them is an email that's hosted by Office 365. That one is not being monitored. It says active and for active, no. The other one looks like it is active, but it's like a web mail, probably through your domain or web host. I don't know why I've got two other than they set something up, I thought, for when I did my bulk emails, but that's through SendGrid. It's not through Microsoft. Okay, yeah, you don't happen to have SendGrid. Oh, yeah, you wouldn't have it. This is your incoming mail, so we would look for that in a different area. So what is coming into Outlook versus the one I pay for, you know,...
