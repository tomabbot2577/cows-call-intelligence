## 💬 Full Transcript

 Dave is away from his desk at this time. Please leave a voicemail, and it will be returned as soon as possible. Make it a great day. Hey, Dave, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. Just wanted to give you a quick call and follow-up. I got your voicemail yesterday, or picked it up today rather than last week. I think we figured everything out in the e-mail late last week, Friday. Just wanted to make sure everything was well and good. I think it puts on a due date by default in the new system, but as long as an auto-pay setup it's all good. But I just wanted to give you a call. I invite you to call me if there's anything else you needed or you had any other questions or had any more issues with that invoice. 440-856-0314. 440-856-0314. Thank you....
