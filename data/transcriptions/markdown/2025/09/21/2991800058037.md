## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** How may I help you?

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** It's Adam Consiglio out in New Mexico.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Good.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Hey, I am working with a form letter, and I can't seem to get the font to change regardless of what I put in the...

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** Oh, okay.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** And so maybe you can help me with that.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** If I can get logged in.

**[0:29] Speaker_00:** Hang on just a minute.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** Actually, in the hospital.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** I'm not in the hospital.

**[0:35] Speaker_00:** A friend of mine is in the hospital, and I'm working on my laptop, which is a challenge.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Gotcha.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** But it's not.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** My login screen is not here.

**[0:48] Speaker_00:** Where did it go to?

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** Maybe I'm logged in.

**[0:54] Speaker_00:** I hate laptops.

**[0:59] Speaker_00:** I don't know how to use the mouse pad.

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** Yeah, those are not fun for me either.

**[1:04] Speaker_01:** I always have to use the mouse.

**[1:06] Speaker_00:** Well, I normally bring one with me.

**[1:09] Speaker_01:** Gotcha.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** It could be that the hospital Wi-Fi is on a VPN, so it might give you some trouble logging in.

**[1:18] Speaker_01:** We could try clearing the cache.

**[1:20] Speaker_01:** I could walk you through that if the login screen.

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** It's just not taking me.

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** I mean, I pulled up PCR, but the little where the login field is supposed to be, it's blank.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** Yeah, let's try.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** Click the three dots at the top right of the browser.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** I'll do that.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** Hold on.

**[1:39] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I know how to do that.

**[1:40] Speaker_00:** Hold on.

**[1:46] Speaker_01:** Yeah, sometimes clearing cache when you're in a business is Wi-Fi.

**[1:52] Speaker_01:** It works.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** Okay, I'll go back.

**[2:22] Speaker_00:** I mean, the Wi-Fi is just slow.

**[2:24] Speaker_00:** Let's just take it off.

**[2:26] Speaker_00:** Time to load.

**[2:27] Speaker_00:** I mean, other stuff loaded.

**[2:30] Speaker_00:** Oh, here we go.
