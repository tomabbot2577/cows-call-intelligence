## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. Good morning. This is Gina with J-Powers. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Hey, Tyler, can you help me figure out what's going on with my PCR capture? Yeah. It says the field overview section are required. Ensure all, whatever, all they are contain data to continue. Yeah, so it sounds like, what fields do you have in the overview section? Okay, so let me see the overview. So the overview is under review company update. I have company name, contact information, under that is email address. What do you have in the overview of the name section? Okay, name. first name, last name, title, LinkedIn, email to home. Okay, so it sounds like you put some custom fields in there in the overview section. And so when you go to save a record, that overview section, you're marking those as required fields. So if you don't want them to be required when you sync them, you'll just have to adjust your capture layout. Okay. Because anything that overview is going to be required. Okay. In order to save the record. All right. So. And you can adjust your layout. So like if you're, you see that little pencil on the top right-hand corner of it? Yes. If you click that pencil, that's where you'll be able to, adjust your layouts. Okay. So, okay, I want the first name. So I'm on that. I just clicked the pencil. So I'm on the configuration now. So first name, last name, title, LinkedIn. And then there's a email home too. So I would get rid of the LinkedIn and the email home. The LinkedIn is going to come over automatically, no matter what. Okay. All right. And so you just click that little X next to each one to remove it. Okay. So I removed LinkedIn. Okay. And then first name, last name. Okay. And then there's a, oh, okay. I probably should take out the email. Yes. Okay. So I took that out. And then the second box where it says group title, contact info, email address, mobile phone. Yes, that's the standard. Okay. So I guess it's all good? Yep, you can hit save down at the bottom. That'll save that layout. Okay. Okay. All right. So now going back to this profile here, I'm going to add the rollup number. Okay. Okay, and then everything looks good. Submit. Okay, now it's fixed. Yep. Yeah, so there was just some custom fields in that overview section that normally don't get pulled in from LinkedIn or like any other site. So because of that, you would have had to manually enter data into those fields each time for it to be able to save. But now that those are gone, you should be good to go. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much. Have a good day. You too. Okay. Bye. Bye....
