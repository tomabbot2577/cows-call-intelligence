## 💬 Full Transcript

 VC3, this is Alex. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail that you're having trouble in PCR. Hi, yeah. I'm actually an MSP for a client of yours that uses it. They're called TradeWin LLC. And it seems like whenever the user tries to open up Outlook and then PCR, it's prompting her for saying that the license is expired. But I don't believe it is. And then when we try to use it, it prompts a couple errors, actually. But it seems to work. It's just we're wondering how to get rid of these errors from prompting. I don't know if that does explain that much to you. No, that makes sense. So, yeah, the license expiration, that happens once a year. Microsoft just requires us to renew the license. It doesn't have anything to do with, like, your billing or your standing with PCR with billing. So, yeah, just give us a call or shoot us an email that needs refreshed, and we will reset that. So I can do that now. Let me pull up. You said their company name is TradeWins LLC? Correct. And I could probably give you some information on their – I don't know if you need their serial key. I don't think there's a licensing number we have on there when we contact you guys for vendor support. But I'll try to find whatever I can. No, that's all right. So I have, let's see, I have a company called Tradewinds Power Corporation, Tradewinds Transportation, Tradewinds Mechanical. Tradewinds Services LLC, that's the name of them. I don't know if they were formally known as. Let me see if I can find any information on that. Or do you, what's the, maybe one of the main contacts there, their name? And I could look them up that way. It would be Scott, and let me get his last name for you. Perfect. Tradewinds. Oh, I found it here. Scott Herzl. Yep, Scott Herzl. That's it. Got it. Okay. So let me reset the Outlook portal license real quick here. And you said there were other errors that you were getting when you were inside of Outlook related to the plug-in. Yeah. So the other – and this is weird. So whenever she turns on her computer and she starts her day, she has to go to Task Manager and kill Outlook, the services, if it's open or anything, before she starts PCR and Outlook. Is that normal? Is that the standard operating procedure? She was just wondering if that step could be bypassed or if that's something that needs to be resolved. We've seen before people have success by disabling other add-ons inside of Outlook, things like Microsoft Teams or OneNote. Yeah, if there's a way to just kind of deselect those and disable those if they're not using them, that will help Outlook to close down fully when you exit it. So, yeah, we've seen people have success with that in the past. Okay, let me see if there was another picture or screenshot that we had an error for. I was working with her earlier today. Give me one second. I'll pull it up. Sure. Just to know about that other thing with the Microsoft licensing without the licensing, at least that will be resolved. And it's working for her, so it's not that she's been dealing with this, a few pop-ups. Gotcha. Yeah, I just reset that, so it won't bother you again with that pop-up until August of 2026. Okay, cool. I'll let the user know that. Ticket owners, me. Okay. And so the first thing was the licensing one, which she just took care of. Next, it does prompt her when she's in PCR for her password. She tried to enter the password that she has. I even tried entering my admin password that we have on our configurations, and neither one worked. Now, I don't know if that's something that you guys reset for the users. I don't think we have access to it. Because. So for the PCR login, if you're using Outlook like an older version of our plug in there, it started getting this bug where it would prompt for a password and wouldn't accept even the correct one. So we fixed that with our latest update of the Outlook portal plug in. So I could just email you. Let's see. Do I have your email address? Probably not. Yeah, I'll email you a link to download the latest version of the Outlook portal. And once you download that and run the installer, it'll it'll just kind of replace the old one and you'll stop getting that password prompt. OK, perfect. I think that was really the only error other than that that I saw that it was just that password prompt. So I can share my email whenever you're ready. Yeah, let me get a pen here. Okay, yeah, what's your email address? So it's going to be alex.asf, that's A-S as in Sam, E as in Edward, F as in Frank, at vc3. That's victorcharlie3.com. Perfect. Okay, cool. Yeah, I will send you the link to download the update on that Outlook portal, and everything else should be taken care of, especially the licensing pop-up. That's good. And, yeah, just let us know if you have any other questions or if something else comes up like this. Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you so much for your time. Yeah, no problem. Thanks. All right....
