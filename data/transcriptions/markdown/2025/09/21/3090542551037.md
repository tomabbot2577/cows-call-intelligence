## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good morning. Nabil speaking. How are you? Hello. Yeah, Nabil, do you hear me? Yes, I can hear you. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I am very well. Thank you, Jim. How are you? I'm pretty well. I wanted to give you a quick call and kind of check and see what your start date was looking like. Yeah, just keep it on the 1st of January, Jim. I'll be very upfront because I'm still waiting for the interview for my visa. And it is expected by the end of October or maybe in the beginning of November. And after that, it might take a month or maybe two days, up to two or three months, if this has been approved, to get me the visa on my passport. So what I'm looking at it by all timings and the delays and everything, it seems like that I will be able to use PCD report by 1st of January. And then there's also a move involved from Canada to the U.S., right? So there's a lot of ifs and buts, but I know after the interview, I will at least know that I'm getting a visa or not. Okay. So keeping all these things in mind, I would say please keep it at 1st of January because I don't know how I'm going to make it earlier as soon as possible. That is good. That's what I needed to know. I will update our ticket. And I'll touch base with you by mid-October, if that's okay. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. And in case if I'll be able to, because believe it or not, Jim, I've already started paying the rent of the physical office from 1st of September. so every month it's costing me about my rent money about my other stuff that I cannot change the contract that I already started type of thing and the end of rent I couldn't change I wanted to change that but they said well it's a signed lease and we couldn't push the start date and everything otherwise I wanted to do the same thing with my office rent so I'm I'm in a very panic more because as the time is passing by, I'm losing money every month on this. So once I'll get the visa, I will try to be there as soon as possible so that I can, you know, save some money on it. And maybe if I'll be able to make it, let's say, November 1st or let's say mid-November or whatever, or 1st of December, I'm going to let you know that if it's possible to start it a little bit earlier from 1st of January. if not then I'm just putting up a safe side and everything starting from the 1st of January okay perfect what I'll do I'll wait to hear from you but for now I'll pin it January 1st unless I hear otherwise alright fantastic thanks a lot for your help today take care of yourself you as well bye bye...
