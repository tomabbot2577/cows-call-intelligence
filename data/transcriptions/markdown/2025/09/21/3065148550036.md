## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Heather Schmiegel. I am having an issue with PCR. Yesterday I had to – I'm having some memory issues with my computer overall. So I cleared out caches and all that kind of stuff. So I've been trying to email, and it keeps telling me to go to system, email, set up, email, alias, list. So I did that, and it says the connection is fine, but it's still not working. Okay. I'll take a look. Which database are you in? Like PCR or what do you mean? So when you're on your login page. Yeah, there's one called MedVest Office, MedVest Recruiting. MedVest Recruiting. Okay, perfect. And what is your username for PCR? H. Schmiegel H-S-Z-M-I-G-I-E-L Okay Alright So I called our IT company We were messing around with it Trying to get it to work And we thought we had it fixed And then it didn't So I might have changed some things So correct whatever I did wrong Gotcha Okay, yes So we do need a reply to address on here. I'll update that. You're sending email at a blank reply to address. So I'll just copy and paste your from address there. Perfect. I think that helps at all. Check one other spot. Okay. and then what I can do is maybe I'll just create a quick name record for myself and try to email myself and see if there's any error messages that I can't decipher there am I going to need to log out and log back in to get the up I'm assuming you're correcting it on your end of my account um possibly you You might not need to though, we'll see. Okay. Let me just test this here. Here we go. Okay, there's a name record for me. Let me just email myself from your username. PCR support test. Outgoing. Okay, that one looks like it went through. Let me check my inbox here. Yep, I got that immediately. Okay, so it does look like it is sending out. Maybe it was just that reply to address needed updating. Do you want to do any tests? No, I just tried to send what I was sending and it's the same thing. name record are you sending an email to? Who am I sending the email to? Yeah. I'm sending it to five people, my typical five people that I send it. I'm trying to send an invoice submission, and it's through a placement, through a template. Okay. Try, let's see. Yeah, you might want to try maybe logging out of PCR and logging back in and see if that helps. That is a good troubleshooting step. All right, let me try that. And that's best recruiting. I'm under that database, so that's correct, right? I'm not, I had to, yeah, like I said, I kind of wiped my computer when I did the, cleared everything. Sony doesn't get into this. Excuse me. You know, I'm just going to submit to Tyler. And Matt. All right, let me just make a change here. If this doesn't work, we might have to jump on the screen and share something. So we did it this time. Now, hold on a second. Here, let me do this again. Hang on. I have all the information to be able to do this very quickly. Because it seems like when I fill out this whole form is when I have an issue. I just made like one little quick. All right, let me just do this real quick. Yeah, no worries. Amen. Amen. All right, let me try to send this, see if it works. Nope. See, as soon as I fill it, you know what? That is crazy. As soon as I fill out this form and add those multiple people, I get that message. Okay, let me do a screen share and take a look at what you're seeing. So if you want to just open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings.ringcentral.com. You said RingCentral? Yeah, meetings.ringcentral.com. All right. All right. Join the meeting. Yeah, let me know when you need the meeting ID. Yep, I'm ready for it. That is 910-641-105. 910-641-105. All right. Perfect. Awesome. And then if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. I'll just keep my phone muted. Okay, perfect. And then go to the blue button down at the bottom that says share and select your entire screen up at the top. All right, perfect. That's loading. Good. I can see that. All right. Let's jump back over to your PCR screen. Everything is, like, blocked. Get in there. Hit cancel on that. Okay. Okay. So it's this. So now I was able, I sent, like, a fake one to T. Blanton, and it was just him. And it went through. When I add these people and actually fill out the form appropriately, I keep getting this. Okay. And are these email addresses that you are hand typing in or are you selecting them from somewhere? I just copy and paste them from Google. But those are the correct email addresses. I bet you if you take off these four people and I send it to T. Blinn, it'll probably go through. Try closing that pop-up box and just remove one email address. Just choose any one. Try hitting send now. Okay, close that. go ahead and re-enter the one that you took off the NDE Jesus remove a different one maybe the DGlen one hit send let's re-add DGlen and then try...
