## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Hey, I just have a basic question about sending a bulk email and was hoping you might be able to help me. Okay. What is your name? Lori Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S? Yes. Okay. Oh, what company are you with? We have a couple. Yeah, the Colonial Group. There's more than one of me? Well, there's slight variations in spelling of the first name, but same last name. Gotcha. Okay, gotcha. I'm a Williamsburg Colonial Group. Okay, what can I help you with? Okay, so we're probably not using PCR correctly. I'll start by saying that, but the way we have our candidate field set up, we have several different sections for emails. So some of them are personal emails, work emails. And when we go to send a bulk email, it seems as though the only email field we can use is primary email address. And we were hoping to tap in and be able to send a bulk to some of the other email categories. So you can't do it at once. You would have to do separate ones. So let me see what's going on. Yeah, for some weird reason, when I pull it up to send a bulk, when I select the email field, it gives me primary, but then it says a bunch of weird stuff. It says like, yeah, so those work names. Yeah. So what happens with those? So there's really just one email field. It's kind of like a predefined field. Any other email field is considered custom, even if they gave it to you because it gets stored in another table. What database are you in? It is the MR Williamsburg 3 I think is what it says. MR Williamsburg 3. Okay, and what username? LH. LH, okay. I'm gonna see what's in your layout. Because sometimes like it's, if it's one of like our fields, how it displays is a little bit different when you go to pick it. So let me just see something here. Oh, are these you now? You might have an email alias. Let's see. Let me just see something. Email setup, email alias. Getting a little alert. That's one thing you want to have. A delay. Very important to have a delay in your emails. Oh, okay. Especially with Office 365 because like they're very strict on how many you can send and one of the things that happens is if you let's say you're emailing like 50 people what happens is it'll stop at 30 if you don't have any delay you got a space amount and the other thing is if like let's say you're sending it to a bunch of people on the same mail server like Gmail or Office 365 if the if the email starts being like oh here's a bunch of emails literally the same date and time and same message um they might flag you as spam so i made your delay between emails let me tell you about this first if you go to system on the main toolbar and then go down to email setup okay and then go to email alias list that's your settings for when you are logged in as yourself sending an email you had zero in the delay between emails i added the number 3 000 so what that'll do is if you're doing a bulk email it sends the first one then it waits three seconds that's what 3 000 is in milliseconds it waits three seconds and then passes over the next one so it spaces them out it'll slow it down but it certainly will help with delivery and possibly getting um so you don't get your account blocked. You still want to be kind of, you know, spending small batches with an Office 365. You don't want to, you know, long gone are the days of blasting your database. They just won't let you do that through their mail server. Okay, so next thing I'm going to do. I probably need to do that for all of our users then. Yeah, they'll have to log in and make sure the number, 3,000 is a good number. Okay. Okay, so tell me about, okay, so you've got email work. Let me, I'm going to go to the customize screen just to confirm if it's really are email underscore work. Okay. So I know what that means. It's a custom one that we did. Yeah, it's actually email underscore work is really kind of like one that we give you typically. Okay. If you are in a name rock, I'm sorry, if you are, let's say you're in like a roll up or something and you go to send an email, I'm going to tell you, let me bring it up and just confirm which one. In the email field, you're going to want, where there's primary email address, you're going to want work with name. So the ones that we give you, like email underscore work, email underscore home, those are what you're seeing there. So if you want to work when you go work name. anything else that you consider custom like um i don't know work email that's not like that one that says email that's going to be listed at the very bottom but it'll have um like the exact field name so you're going to want to choose the third one in that drop down if it's the work email so on like in a bulk letter if like if i'm in a roll up and I go to do, like right now I'm in a roll up, I go to do a bulk letter. Yes, you'll pick letter. In the email field, primary seems to be the one that works, but we want to do the work, we want to be able to use the work one. Yes, so pr...
