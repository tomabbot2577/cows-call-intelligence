So if it keeps filling in, I think it's that app data. So I'm going to have you clear that. Then we'll do an uninstall, reinstall again. Or actually, let's just try clearing the app data first. Let's see if that does anything. Do I need to use the, okay. Okay. So you're going to use the, yeah, you don't need camera.

Okay, let's try this. Where is it then? Hold on one second. Data. All right. And the PC Recruiter, the inhaler, several times. And every time it reinstalls, it's got exactly the same data in it. Like, it's got my license. I want it so, like, it's a complete, you know, new installation. Yeah. Which is why I want to get to, let's see, how to find. So when I reinstalled it, it looks exactly like it did before. and I want to strip out all this stuff just to re-register and all. And I'm not sure why that is. Try doing this. press your Windows key on your keyboard and then also hold down your R key. Okay, there it is. NCP.cpl. Okay, replace that with, God, this is so different than I'm doing it.
