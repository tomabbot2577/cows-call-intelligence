## 💬 Full Transcript

 Response technology partners. This is Stuart. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail from Shane that he was having trouble with PCR. He was, and it was a RingCentral integration, but I believe we figured out what it was. It's a user setting. So I think we're good to go. He's still working with the user, but I think we're okay. Okay, awesome. Yeah, if anything else comes up, just let me know. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Bye....
