## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology, the PC Recruiter software. I was just speaking with George. He said to give you a call about PCR connection. Yeah. Let me grab my computer here. We'll look at that real fast. Sure. So I was trying to figure out what would have happened, because I know I've been helping them with some website stuff, but we haven't made any DNS changes. Okay. Yeah, that was the first thing I suggested, just to make sure that it wasn't. So, basically, it is sending email out through PCR. I just did a test. I sent an email to myself. But there is this error message when you test the connection that says domain spoofing prohibited. It actually gives a couple numbers, 551.1.2.3, domain spoofing prohibited is kind of the error code that comes up when you test the email connection. So I just, even though it does send email and it does look like it's working, I was just wanted to bring that up to him as a concern, just in case he does get some kind of, I don't know, you know, blowback from the providers. Maybe he's getting put into spam somehow. I don't know what would be causing that domain spoofing prohibited then, because you said that the domain settings are all set up correctly. So it's kind of a... So are you guys hosting his email? Is his webmail going through his website currently? Yeah, we don't host any of the emails. It's going through a website called Vario.com. It says email host. Yep, and the SOA looks correct. The SPF looks like it's set correctly. Okay, that's good. Here, let me actually do a Google search on that exact error message I'm getting. see if there's any other suggestions on why that might come up yeah everything looks right website welcome me 3d and s SPF 26961280. That was right. Okay, yeah. I'm just, when I do a Google search on this error, it's just giving me kind of forums of people asking that same question. And then, you know, kind of non-experts giving answers. So these aren't too helpful. Let's see. Yeah. They're just saying, you know, maybe it's a problem with the mail delivery service, whoever you have for that. I don't know. Yeah. I haven't heard of Vario myself, so maybe it's, maybe it's just that. So Vario, It looks like Vario is a reseller from 2Cals. Oh, okay. That makes sense. Okay. Well, yeah, I mean, the good thing is he is still able to send email out of PCR, no problem. It just sent – I did a test a couple minutes ago, and that's in good shape. So I guess I would just keep that in the back of your mind, that it has that domain spoofing error. And if you start getting any, you know, hitting spams or any messages from your provider that something's wrong or something, I don't know, just maybe keep an eye on that part of it. But it is working on TCR. I'm helping him to build a new website, but we're still on the test server. We haven't touched anything in terms of DNS yet, aside from he just gave me a login. Okay, gotcha. You just gave me the login because I was just trying to locate everything so I knew where it was when it was time to need it. And I can see the DNS. I don't see – I haven't made any changes, and everything looks like it's right for how it's configured for Webmail currently. Okay. I'm not entirely sure why it's – I wonder if maybe they might have had a – outage or something. Could be. Yeah, it could be something with Vario itself was having issues. But yeah, I think they're in good shape. I'll give George a call back and let him know that the emails are working. And there is always a possibility that this is kind of like a false error or some kind of error that comes up when you test the connection that that shouldn't really even be showing. But, yeah, I'll just let them know that it is all working and we should be in good shape. Okay. Hold on. Let me check one more thing real fast. I want to check that SPF checker tool real quick. Make sure it is configured. Okay. Okay. It should be there. So it should be sending from this IP. Because it is a little bit of a different format, but I know some of those records can be a little different. Yeah, it says it allows SPF 1, and it includes that website, and that IP that I listed is allowed. Okay, good. Good, good, good. So while we're sending that IP, which is where it's configured for, it should be fully functional. We'll confirm the second IP listed here. That might be like their end mail server. And it's, yeah, both of them packed. Okay, good. All right, yeah, it should be in good shape then. It might just be a false error in the PCR test connection setup here. It looks like there's not a DMARC published, but all the SPF is configured correctly. Okay, gotcha. But that might just be how it's always been. Right. Right. That could be. That makes sense. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, that sounds good. I'll just give George a call back and let him know that it's working. And it might have just been a temporary outage with Vario where he couldn't send mail before. Yeah. That's what...
