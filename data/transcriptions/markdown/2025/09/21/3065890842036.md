So I'm enjoying the sunshine while I can, or trying to at least. Yep. Yesterday, since we're sort of new to Blairsville, I have found that my neighbors are out mowing. I need to be out mowing too because they know more about the weather than I do alright what did we have we had failed transactions for you right yeah that's what it was do I go to that website that billing account thing yeah we could do that or I could do it for you it's up to you what's nice about if you do sign up for the billing portal if you ever wanted to go in and change your card or view your invoices or print receipts, you can always do that. But if you want for today, I can just get you set up. Okay, yeah, let me go ahead. Well, we're going to do auto pay anyway. And most of the time, y'all do receipts. And, you know, I always, on my bank statements, I always have that as a copy. So I assume that's good enough for the CPA. He hasn't ever questioned it before. The card we had in file ended in 0154. Is that not the correct card? That is 0154. No, that is the correct card. Okay. 0154. Yes, that is the correct card. All right. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to turn off the auto pay for a moment. Let's just redo this because wasn't it yours? I was saying it was something with an address. Let me see. Declined. Transaction details. Address information not verified for domestic transactions. I don't know what that means. It's not Blairsville, Georgia anymore, right? No, it is Blairsville, Georgia. 30512? Correct. Straight at. Okay. That's the zip code. The address is 2817 Georgia, you know, GA Highway 180. Oh, it says 2801. I wonder if that's how you do it. No, it's 2817. Okay. Let's try this. I want to kind of see what it does. Let's see. let's go med staffing I'm going to take this card out and then we'll just kind of redo it let me turn this off okay advanced options okay because stored payment methods I'm going to take this card out and I'm just going to kind of redo it and let's see what happens okay It's a stored payment method. Okay. So the name on the card, is it Kay Crosby? No, the one that you have. I tell you what, I did not do that. Let me go and get my wallet and confirm, because Crosby and I have, I think, the same account, but different numbers. Hold on. Oh, interesting. What? I'm actually going to fix your address in another place. Tell me your address again. I wonder if that has something to do with it. What is your address? 828-17, Georgia. They used to have it as capital G, capital A, Highway 180. Okay. Okay. And then what is the city and state? Blairsville, Georgia. And is it B-L-A-I-R followed by an S? Yes. Blairsville, B-L-A-I-R-S-V-I-L-L-E. Okay. And the zip code is 30512. Okay. Let me fix this in the back end first. I wonder if that has anything to do with it. Okay. I'm also going to update your next invoice to have the correct address. I'm going to have to change. All right. No. That is my card number. 0154 is my card number. Okay. Well, I took that one out. I want to do this all from scratch. So 2817 GA Highway 180, Blairsville, Georgia, 30512. Okay. All right. Because I'm wondering, because the system itself had a different address for your address, and I'm wondering if it was kind of maybe thinking it was suspicious being in a different state.
