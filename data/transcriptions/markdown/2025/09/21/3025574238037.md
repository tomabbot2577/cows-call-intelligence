## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Otherwise, check. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning, this is Jim. Hey, Jim, how you doing? Good morning. I'm well. Christopher, how are you? I'm doing well. Nice to meet you. Fantastic, and good to meet you. I wanted to kind of talk with you a little bit through the process with PC Recruiter and Dimensional Search and talk about how those two are related and everything there. Are you part of the September class? Yes. I was, we're trying to get me in for August. Okay. Okay. August 4th. I think that is. Oh, that should still be here. I'm, I'm thinking a week short. Yeah. Christina has been kind of rushing me through it because August is, it's probably the better timeframe than waiting until September. September might be too long because at this point, I've already started doing a lot of the work. I still need a couple of things I got to get done. You know, my company name I've been working on with Darren, and I got to get that figured out. And I just got my market, my vertical market set up. So, you know, there's a couple of things I still need to do before getting into the training. Okay, excellent. So what we can do is we can get you going and underway with PC Recruiter quickly. So what I can do is, so I would be able to send over the paperwork today to sign to get everything started. It comes through like a DocuSign style agreement. It's PandaDoc, just a different name brand of that. And it is $7.50 set up, $50 per user per month. And it's just you, just one user for now? Yes, that's correct. Okay. And then what happens is once you sign the agreement, then they send the invoice for the setup in first month. Once that's paid, we will get a trainer here at PC Recruiter assigned to you. And that trainer is going to get two to three training sessions in before your dimensional search training. So they'll get you the basics on PC Recruiter, creating records, some of the setup. And another bonus is you get the dimensional search template. So there's some pre-populated information and templates in your database and stuff like that. So you would get that. And then, so we'll do a couple hours training. Then there will be the dimensional search will take some training for a while during your class. Then you'll come back to PC Recruiter and do a little bit of training. So they kind of bounce you back and forth. And we know what they do, and they know what we do. So they have a nicely coordinated training program there to get everything up and running. Okay. So all I need to do to email everything over to you to get signed and started is know your company name and email or your company name and street address. Even though I email, we just need a street address for tax purposes. Yeah, I have a street address, but I don't have my company name yet. The company name I'm still working on. Okay. And we can actually put that in your name. So we can put the contract in your name because you're the owner of the company and you'll be the signer. So that happens sometimes. Okay. Okay. Because right now I have a name that I set up on the business website for Sunbiz in Florida just to get, because I had to work on an SBA loan. And not until I spoke to people at the company did I find out that really I should choose something that's a little bit more generic as a name. Because I just used CJO Recruiting Solutions, LLC. and they figuring that, you know, I should try and get something a little bit more, I don't know how you would say it, just branded, something that I could brand a little bit easier than my initials. Okay, sure, sure. So yeah, so what we would do, we could just put it in your name. That's no problem there. So what would be the street address that I could make it under? It's 3307 Port Royal Drive South. The apartment is 206. I'm in Fort Lauderdale. That's Florida. 33308. 33308 and I think I have your email address in my system already yeah I do the gmail address well that's my personal email once I have a company name they're going to set me up with a business one I don't know if I can update that afterwards what will happen once you get your company name so I'll put everything under your name just Christopher Ortiz but once you get the company name let me know we can change that in our records I don't know that we'll change it on the actual URL of the database, but that's nothing anybody sees except you, so it wouldn't really matter anyway. And then we'll update your email address. Anything needs updated on our end, we can do that. So no problem to do that. Okay. Yeah, because I don't want to use my personal email for the business. I would rather use a company email. Okay. Yeah, after you get that new address, just let me know and I can update it here. So that's no problem there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Any other questions at all? I'm going to send everything over. Yeah, my assumption was that we were going to b...
