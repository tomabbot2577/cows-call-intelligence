 Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Melissa. Hi, is Kathy available? May I ask who's calling? Sure, this is Robin Montoni. Okay, just one second. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Kathy? Hi, it's Robin. Hello. Hi. I have a question I'm a little stumped on. Can I have you look up a customer for me? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. William Hague, H-A-G-U-E. Yep. he had auto pay set up when he paid the, when he made his payment on June 27th and it's gone. And he's like, okay, why did I get this 10 day notice thing? And I said, well, I see you have auto pay on. So I even did the click here if you wish to auto pay. And when I go to history and go to transactions, it's like, it's not even trying it though. Do you know what could be wrong? I've tried to click here to auto pay even twice I'm waiting a little bit before I even called you yep some reason Billard Uni is making me sign in like I have to click a link in my email just sign me in it's annoying isn't it I feel like it makes you do it at least once a day so William Pegg so it says under history yeah it's got the June process of 627 yeah so it should have automatically processed 727 and didn't it should have and then I went in the customer area the red banner is there I've tried it twice now I've waited like five ten minutes sometimes it's well yeah because sometimes it takes a couple of minutes for it to process because I've done that before and I did it twice and I was like, oh. But it's like not showing anything that's been at least 10 minutes now. Yeah, that's kind of weird. I don't know why. And it doesn't show that the auto pay failed. Let me check one other thing. Let me check the auto pay declines. I wasn't really sure where else to look. Oh, it says an error. It says an error response was sent from the gateway while trying to create a sale transaction. The credit card has expired. That's why it didn't pay because his credit card has expired. Okay. Let me see. Can I see? He needs to update the credit card because it says that it expires. I wish there was a way to see that. Well, yes, and there was a couple of notes. So if you look at... Oh, it is 0625. Okay. The store payment method. Yeah, but under reports, there is a... Okay. Let's see. Customer reports. It'll show you three different sections of items. And I saw that last week, and I meant to send it to you. and I give. So, come on, it's being really slow. It's thinking, thinking, thinking. Oh my goodness gracious. Why does it take this much thought? So reports and then customer reports. So when the card's expired, it doesn't even try to process. that okay no the no the expiration date is required it has to have a current expiration date okay so won't even come back declined and that's where things are messed up okay maybe that's what's going on there was another classroom like why didn't this process and it was a pretty decent was it Delta diversified maybe okay so well if you're able to pull up the customer reports under reports on there the first section tells you like just like all the customers that are in the system that has put their stuff in their emails confirmed the second group though says stored payment method and it tells you what is expired like world bridge partners Cleveland their card has expired and I And I'll tell you if it's auto-enabled, and it says William Hague and his expired in June. And they're red. And then you can see anybody that's red. Another one is Thomas Perry. His credit card has now expired. And I would have thought that an email would have gone out from Billergy, but they might not have paid attention. like the Bishop Group, theirs is now expired. Calent Partners, MRI Maryland, theirs expired. Sharp Solutions, theirs expired last month, so they probably have one outstanding plus potentially one in August, depending on when they bill. Yeah, so that's where to find, you know, if there's any, you know, question about if anything has expired and who's actually set up on auto pay because it will actually tell you on there if it's set up for auto pay or not. Okay. Mr. Cleveland downtown, he's expired. Mintz, North America. So it looks like I can do store payment method. I can sort it by expiration date too. There we go. I could sort it. Okay, well, this is a new list. Okay. Yeah. I'll have to add these to my collections list. Yeah, yeah. I've been going through. I've been emailing, getting in trouble for a couple. I don't know. I have no idea what happened. Somebody recluded me. I'm mad because, I don't know, I sent an email. or somebody sent an email telling them. Which one is? Recluda. I don't know. How do you spell that? R-E-C-L-U-T-A. I don't know. It's one of Tino's. Anytime it involves Tino, I swear I got half the answer. From Costa Rica. So, yeah, they haven't paid since a payment in May. so they haven't paid the May, June or July invoice. They had a sales receipt so I've been kind of looking for those to be honest if they have a payment method in QuickBooks tha...
