## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Amanda over at Ringside. How are you today? Good. How are you? Good. Good. I was... Go on, Sam. Okay. Sorry about that. Okay. Go on. No worries. So I was trying to send out a form letter to an email address, and I keep getting a pop up that says uh-oh you see our recruiter could not send email email address is restricted or opted out and I looked at our opted out list it's just one name yes okay it's just that I do first okay so what does the message say that it may be opted out yes it's restricted or opted out okay and that That probably means that it's in the opt-out list. I went there and I could not, I searched it and could not find it. Because I was going to say, if it's just one name, sometimes what you might need to do is look at the email address itself. Like, let's say like it's robin at main sequence dot net. Sometimes you would see, but it's usually the standard like, oh, your email alias is not connected. If you're missing like the at symbol or the dot, like something with a bad format. which database is this in? This is the ringside restore. Okay restore ringside search partners. Okay let me see what is the name of the person you're emailing? This is Steven Gerlach so it's a S T E P H E N and then Gerlach G E R L A C H. Okay, and there's an email address and an email other. I pulled it from the, I was using the. Is it from the email address field? Okay, let me see. Got the hotmail email address, okay. Steven Gerlach he just added 8-22-2025 yep he called in and I was trying to send him an email for a resume question and then like a questionnaire so I'm like yeah he's brand new he's not That is so odd. You know what? I'm going to go in. And you're sending it as you, right? And what is your email? I'm sorry. Not email address. What is your username? Amanda. Okay. Let me go into you. I was like, well, I could just send them from Outlook. But I'm trying to send the questionnaire. Obviously, you can't really do that. Yeah, I got it. Let me see. See my girl lock. Okay, I'm going to do something temporarily, and then I'll turn it off. Under international settings, it's where you can see name. Okay, there is a thing. There's no status. And it is a hotmail email address. Okay, let me turn that off. Yeah, that's not there. That's really weird. It's definitely not international. He's here. Yeah, well, there's, like, okay, I have it on for one moment. If you refresh his name record, if you go to the email field, you'll now see this, like, little caution thing. Right now there's no status. but if you were to click it you could see if he was opted out or things like that it would kind of look up if it was on the I see the caution if you click it it lets you manage so why would I'll turn that back off it allows somebody to put somebody like like on an opt-out list right from the record. It is a neat little feature. Also probably I can imagine some of our users probably abusing that like oh they didn't want me to call so I'm just going to take them off the opt-out. Right yeah so I'm going to turn that back off. Okay because it's not like a per user thing. Yes. Okay, so why would... There's no activities. Okay, you're NSU. Email alias list. Your authentication is fine. You're emailing other people just fine right? I believe so. I don't send too many from from PCR. I'm not exactly the form letter PCR super user. And you're using the back office account or the Amanda ad account? Like your default alias? Yeah the Amanda is my default. All right. I'm just gonna back off. This is more like our contractor compliance emails. Okay let me see. I think I sent a couple out last week with no letter were you what form letter were you sending um it is it is um sorry pulling it back up um it is ringside resume request dash name first name last for the um Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. Rank sign, okay. Oh, I think I have something in there saying thanks and then name. The, sorry? Oh, in your letter you got like thanks, name. Oh yeah, so that way we change the name of who's sending the letter. So like if another person wanted to send it out, they update name to John. Oh well it's already got the signature tag in there. So whoever's sending it put their signature in. Yes, yeah we have that in there as well. So that way they have that. but just that way there's like a less formal, I guess. Can I do a screen share with you? Because I'm sending it to myself. I got it. Not seeing it on the app. I wonder if it's going to do with Hotmail. Could Hotmail be blocking? We were making a joke about the Hotmail domain being old school and dating us. But I'm pretty certain it still works as far as emails go. Yes, Hotmail. Now, Outlook.com can block emails due to various reasons, including spam filters, sender reputation issues, suspicious links or attachments. Hmm. Can you try just a, have you talked to him and told him that you're getting, you're having an issue emailing him? Does h...
