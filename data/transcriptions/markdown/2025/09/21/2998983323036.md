## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Good morning. I am trying to align my email folders so that the emails actually populate the name record, email field, you know, to and from and everything. And I'm not able to get that done. and I'm doing something wrong, even though I've loaded my IMAP and my POP. So I need to take a look and make sure I'm doing it right or wrong. Sure. Yeah, let me fire up a screen share meeting. In a new tab in your browser, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Hey, do you know anything about this meetings at ringcentral.com? Is that like something that any RingCentral person can basically do? Yeah. Yeah, if you have the RingCentral app, you can start a meeting. Yeah, we do. We have the tie-in with the PCR, yeah. Oh, good. Yeah. All right. Meeting ID, personal link. Perfect. ID is 447-626-608. joining always open essential for that How do you join audio, computer? You can continue with the audio since we're already on the phone. Oh, okay. It makes more sense. and then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top perfect okay cool I can see that all right yeah you can close that there we Yeah. So PCR mail, I've got it running right now, updating. I ran that on the pop here. IMAP is already working down here. So that's, I think, up to date for the most part. This is the pop and it's still up to date, but it's just running the back stuff right now. But the problem I have is when I go here, let me start, so I know that these went out. These are the 15 names that I built an import device into. So these people came into the system and I know that in activity they got emailed right here this morning, but I don't see it here. OK, those that email tab is only usable with an IMAP connection. IMAP is what scans your sent folder, your inbox. So if you sent it with the email that you have set up as a POP, nothing will appear in the emails tab. No, I set it up with this one, my email here, which is the IMAP. OK. Let's see. Yeah, go to mail servers. That first one. OK, go to the action dropdown on the left and edit that mail server. and just hit test connection at the bottom. Okay, that's good. So you can close that and close this pop-up here and then go to email folders at the top center. Oh, sorry, back to configure to the right of that and then at the top center, yeah, there's email folders. Scroll down. Just what I think it's supposed to be. Okay. If you scroll down, let's look for the scent folder and the trash. Okay, those are mapped, so that's in good shape. Then go to preferences up at the top. And in the bottom frame, go to activities on the left. And we have both those set correctly, those dropdowns. Good. Okay, so everything's set up correctly. when was this email connection set up for the IMAP? Was it today? No, the IMAP was set up a week, two weeks ago. Okay. All right. So check your sent folder on the left for the IMAP. And let's see if we could find that email that was sent to, I think. None of them are populating here. They were all sent this morning. Oh, okay. So I have an automatic, I have an N8N, if you're familiar with that, an automatic trigger that pulls in these leads from physician job board, and they put it into PCR. Okay. And then it sends an email, triggers an email through my, well, should be triggering it through that IMF CEO at Liberty Health. So when I click on this guy, it shows the activity, again, of the email sent here. Okay. But it's not capturing here. and to your point, it's not capturing here either. And I know for a fact that at least I'm getting some of them out because I am getting responses. Like I don't see it in my scent folders either. Oh, so yeah. So all PCR can really do is scan your scent folder. So if it's not showing up there, that's why it wouldn't show up in PCR. Okay. So, yeah, I'm not sure what that, how that trigger is set up, but it doesn't look like the email is actually landing in your sent folder. So, if there's a way to make that happen with the trigger you're using, that would allow PCR then to scan the sent folder and see the email and write the activity. Got it. I'd probably have to send the body of it to the sent folder. All right. So that's where that is coming from. So PCR just basically replicates whatever the server is doing, right? Right, right. Okay. Then I guess the next question is you guys have a PCR capture inhaler, excuse me, CD inhaler. I set that up once a couple weeks ago on a PC it's for this email here and supposedly every time a CV comes into this folder it's supposed to check it and see if it's bad, see if it's a duplicate and then import it. That hasn't happened for a while Does the PC that is maintaining the resume inhaler, does that need to be like on and open all the time or is it set it and forget it and it just runs in the background kind of thing? And I know you work on a Mac, so. Right. No, yeah, ...
