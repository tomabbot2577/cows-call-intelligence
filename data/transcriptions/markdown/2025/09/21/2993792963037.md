## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Welcome to Zoom.

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Enter your meeting ID.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** Enter your participant ID.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** You are in the meeting now.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** There are two participants in the meeting.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** Hello, Robin and John.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** Yes, hello there.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Okay, perfect, perfect.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** Robin, do you hear me?

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** Do we hear you?

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Maybe.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** Robin, do you hear me at all?

**[0:54] Speaker_04:** Yes, I do now.

**[0:55] Speaker_04:** Awesome.

**[0:55] Speaker_04:** I'm plugging.

**[0:56] Speaker_04:** I need a new headset.

**[0:58] Speaker_04:** I've trampled this stupid long cord on it.

**[1:02] Speaker_04:** It's so long.

**[1:03] Speaker_04:** It's like, I don't know, six feet long.

**[1:05] Speaker_04:** So what ends up happening is I roll my chair over it, and it's getting a little, I'll just say sensitive.

**[1:14] Speaker_04:** And it doesn't always want to connect.

**[1:16] Speaker_04:** I've got to reconnect it sometimes.

**[1:18] Speaker_04:** I know.

**[1:19] Speaker_04:** I need a wireless, I think.

**[1:21] Speaker_04:** That's what I have.

**[1:22] Speaker_01:** It works pretty well.

**[1:23] Speaker_04:** Yeah, my chair just keeps trampling it.

**[1:27] Speaker_04:** Like every time you move, it like rolls over it.

**[1:30] Speaker_04:** And so there's some spots I think that every once in a while, if you move it just one way, it doesn't like it.

**[1:37] Speaker_04:** So anyway, that's my big problem for the day, which is good, right?

**[1:41] Speaker_04:** That's my biggest problem.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** I'm good.

**[1:44] Speaker_01:** Yeah, that's not too bad.

**[1:46] Speaker_04:** Yeah.

**[1:46] Speaker_01:** So, yeah, glad we could connect and wanted to kind of run through just a couple of questions here, John.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** So I would introduce you to Robin.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** She's going to be your trainer, getting up and running and trained on PC Recruiter.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** Hi, Robin.

**[2:01] Speaker_01:** And you've not used before, have you, John, or do you have some PC Recruiter experience?

**[2:07] Speaker_02:** I'm sorry?

**[2:09] Speaker_01:** Do you use or have you used PC Recruiter in the past at all?

**[2:15] Speaker_03:** I did, but it was so long ago.

**[2:18] Speaker_03:** It was like 15 years ago when I worked with an agency, and they used it.

**[2:24] Speaker_03:** So, yeah, not really.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** Perfect, perfect.

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** And Robin, do you have questions?

**[2:30] Speaker_01:** Do you want to use my questions?

**[2:32] Speaker_01:** How do you prefer to go about a call like this?

**[2:36] Speaker_04:** Let's start with yours, and then I'll jump in if I have any more.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** I'll go through and I'll just fill out that profile that we used to use back in the day.
