## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, you've reached Michelle Collins with Meritus Executive Search Excellence. I'm not available to take your call at the moment. Please leave your name, number, and message, and I'll return your call as soon as possible. Thank you. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. So sorry that we missed your call. I got your voicemail. what you were asking about with the capture tool is definitely possible. It would just involve changing your capture tool layout. And then you could add a group in there that says add to rollup. And that'll stay in your layout as you capture moving forward. You can even adjust in the layout editing screen and put a default rollup and select that in your layout so that every time you use it moving forward, people will go into that by default. I'll send you an email with some instructions. Maybe I can find a video on our learning center that can help with that. And just email me back if you have any questions. We could go from there. Thanks so much. Look out for an email from me....
