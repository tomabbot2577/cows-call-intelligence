## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSignals Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I am having problems with my PC recruiter interfacing with LinkedIn and Monster to import candidates. Oh, the capture tool? Yeah. Okay. What issue are you seeing? Well, whenever I pull up a new candidate, the capture icon does not pop up to capture them. Okay. So if you go to the top right of your browser and click on the little capture logo up there, does it open the capture menu or is it showing it like a strange error? So when you say capture, is that the extensions? Yeah, if you just click on the extension logo at the top right. Yeah, it doesn't show an error. Okay, no error. Okay, that's good at least. Let's see. Let's check to make sure you have the right version number. So if you click the three dots at the top right of your browser, look for extensions, manage extensions. Okay. And do you have Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge? The Google Chrome logo is like a circle with a blue dot in the middle and red, yellow, and green around it. Yeah, at the top left by extensions, it's the Google Chrome. Okay, good. So at the top right, it says developer mode. There's a little toggle. Make sure that's turned on. Hold on one second. Okay. Sorry about that. No problem. What were you saying? So at the top right, there's a toggle that says developer mode. Go ahead and switch that on if it's already. It is on. Awesome. So that will give us the version number of each one of your extensions. So if you go to PCR capture, what version number are you seeing next to that? Should be like a 1. Yeah, there you go. 1.2.1? Uh-huh. Okay, awesome. So that's the right one. And then also, yeah, go to your extension again at the top right, that little logo. Is it listing a list of websites or is it asking for the PCR URL? It's got Adobe, Cisco, PCR, and save email. Okay, yeah. So that's your list of extensions on this page. But if you go back up to the top right of your browser and click on that little PCR capture logo again, the extension, what do you see when it opens up? Is it a list of websites like LinkedIn, Indeed, CareerBuilder, or is it asking for a PCR URL? The problem is whenever I click on the PCR logo, it shows me just a narrow toolbar that I can't see everything. everything. Oh, okay, yeah, that's kind of the error one that people have been seeing. Okay, so if your computer kind of reacted that way to the newest update, we probably should just remove the tool and then reinstall it. I think that'll fix it. So if you're still looking at your list of extensions on the current page, there's a remove button under the PCR capture. Go ahead and click on that. Okay, hold on just a second. Okay, I'm going to remove it. Perfect. And then on the left of that page, it says discover more extensions and themes on the Chrome Web Store. You want to click on that. Okay. And then type in PCR capture in the search bar at the top and search for that. Okay. Got it. And then open up that first result there, the capture tool. And once you click on that, you should see add to Chrome at the top right. I do not see that. So what are you seeing on your screen currently? Oh, it popped up. Okay. Add to Chrome. Perfect. extension. Exactly, yep. And that will reinstall the tool and then we'll just get you signed into that tool again. So you should see it's like a white puzzle piece at the top right of the browser. If you hover over it, it does say the word extensions. If you click on that, it'll list all of your extensions and you can pin the PCR capture tool again up there. Okay, I'm looking for the area that you want me to hover over. So, yeah, it's top right, kind of where you were clicking on the PCR logo, the capture menu before, like a white puzzle piece directly next to that. Yeah. Click on that and make sure the PCR capture is pinned so that the capture logo is up and to the left of that puzzle piece. Okay. Got it. And when you click on that capture logo again, is it asking for a PCR URL? Let me get out of here. No. Okay. What do you see? Okay. When you click on it, what does it say? say just as PCR capture and then what's below that when I click on the PCR capture icon logo yeah what does it say when you click on that PCR capture oh now it's asking for the URL yes okay so that needs you to just open up PCR and a new tab you might already have that open and just copy that full web address and and paste it in there. Okay, I've copied the URL that you're saying open up a new window. So, yeah, are you looking at PCR right now, and then you copied that web address? I'm not looking at, you mean the PCR in general how to sign on? Yeah, that's the web address it needs so it can get to your account specifically when we sign in. Okay. Should I sign in now? You don't have to sign in. Just grab the web address up at the top. Okay, I've done that. Perfect. And then you can click on the PCR extension logo at the top right again so that it'll let you enter that...
