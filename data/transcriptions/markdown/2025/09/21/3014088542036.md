## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good morning. Chris, how are you? I'm doing well, brother. How are you? I'm all right. I'm all right. Yes, I wanted to, today, I think we were going to take a look at the AI suite. Can I talk a little bit about that? Yeah, man, just give me the rundown. I want to see if it's something that we can utilize. I guess I could have done my own research, but it's always more efficient for somebody that knows what the hell they're doing to tell you what the hell it does. Sure, I'll share my screen and kind of show you a little bit around what it does as well. So let me share that there. Get into my database here. So the AI Suite, what it does, have you seen it in your database yet? Because it's on there as kind of a trial for the summer. They've kind of enabled it. So where would I see it, I guess? Well, you see my screen, okay. what you'd be able to do any name record for example one click you'll see it is on the summary button or on the summary tab it's going to be this AI generator at the far right hand and that little icon it's like a purplish bluish PC recruiter icon so that icon so you'll see that on an email send screen candidate summary job description so there's a few different places you'd see it in the system there. I'm not seeing that. So I'm in edit name. And if you go to summary, if you go to any candidates record, go to summary. At the end of that long string of different controls, there should be that little AI suite, that little AI generator there. Okay, so summary is not pinned for me. Let me pin that. It may not be because it's not usually widely used up until now. That's why they put the AI generator there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. So bam, summary. And when I pin this for one person, it's going to pin it for everybody, right? Nope, just for you. Okay. No, no, no, no. What I mean is if I pin it, let's say, for example, I went to a guy named Tony. I went to summary. I pinned it to my task bar, basically, edit name, resume, interviews, activity, rollup, et cetera. Now that I've pinned it on him, it's going to pin it across all databases, across all of my names in my database. No, not unless you copy it. You can copy your user settings to all the other users, but it won't by default. Because that way it gives you the ability to kind of customize or personalize it if you wish. But anyone can do that if they wish. So if you're on that summary, do you see that little icon at the end of the line? Yep, and I'm in it. Okay, yeah. So what that will do, so it is on a trial basis right now. It does require you to do a premium upgrade because it really requires the premium package to run fully. So we can talk about that afterwards once I show you kind of what it does. But if you click that button, what it's going to do is I click it. It's going to take into account in this case, it will take into account the person's resume and all their field data and it's going to generate a summary. So it's going to generate a little bit of a candidate summary for them based on the info you have on them. And then if you save that summary, you can keep that in the summary area. It's going to be searchable data and it's also going to be something that you can search on. Maybe you want to email it out to someone or share it as part of a candidate presentation too. So it just generates a candidate description or a little summary. You can hit it again. It'll regenerate. So maybe it'll pull it into bullet points or something like that. So it kind of regenerates a little bit as you want. Okay. So that's one of the content generators. The other one, very similar, just a little bit different use on every position in the job description field. there is now going to be an AI button like that. So if you click that, that will generate a job description. Taking into account the details in the field, the details of the company, so it will generate a job description. So a job description generator is the second piece of that. The third piece is going to be an email generator. So if you're in PC Recruiter, anywhere you would go to send an email. So I'm just going to go to a record, go to an email send screen. You're going to see that same icon at the top. And if you click that icon, it pops up a new pop-up screen and it's going to give you a little bit, this one's a little bit more involved because you can say how you want your email to sound. Maybe I want formal. Maybe it's going to be a follow-up. Then it's going to generate an email. And then maybe you respond. I mentioned the interview last week. So I can add something in there, kind of add to it. It'll regenerate. And I think you can do it six or eight times. add qualifiers or by the ways or hey add this mention this anything like that so it's going to kind of generate some email content and then you can hit the reg...
