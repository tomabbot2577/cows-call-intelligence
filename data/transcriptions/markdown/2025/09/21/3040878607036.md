## 💬 Full Transcript

 welcome to zoom enter your hey guys no yelling I'm going on a call enter your participant ID followed by pass you are in the meeting now there is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, this is Jim. Hey Jim, Eric here. Hey Eric, how are you? Good, there's Matt. Hello. Hello, Matt, how are you? Good. Jim, how are you? I'm well, I'm well. Do you have a camera, Jim, or are you just calling in? Oh, no, I have a camera. I just always keep it off. Well, we're in the people business. We like to see faces. That's no worries. Pop it on right there. I just keep it off. There you go, real person. But not a demo today, so I don't have to keep it off for sure. Thank you, Jim, for doing that. No problem. We actually like seeing who we're talking with. Okay, so I think that's everybody. We don't have anybody else joining us, Jim. So, Jim, we – Eric, did you already update Jim as to what we're doing? Yeah, we had a conversation a couple weeks back, two, three weeks ago, I think, when it first came out, what we were trying to accomplish. So I had reached out to Jim early on just to at least get the ideas rolling. Okay, cool. So, Jim, you understand. Maybe you tell me what you understand, and then we can go from there. I think, as I recall, it was spinning off a new division, a new and separate division of TIGES still kind of under the umbrella, but a different division. I don't know if that's physical location or what or how many people were going or what. So I know the basics, I recall, when we spoke. Yes. So we're taking basically we've had different groups and we had a group or like an entity called Tigus Elite. And we're going to spend that under a new name. And that part that physically is here in Florida. And basically it's all the same people log in. Still have a different email, though. So you'll have to know that. But it's all the same people. It's going to run on the same MSP, but under a different way. We'll have access to it through the web. But we're basically just a group, the same group. But it's going to be a spinoff, a separate entity, if you were to call it that. So with that entity, then it would be billed separate, though. We want to keep the costs separate. So it wouldn't be billed to Eric anymore. It would be billed to what's called index search group. An index search group has will be able to process it. And I can be the responsible person for that at the moment. Cool. OK, so really what we're looking for is just the same tool and process we have today. You know, we use PC recruiter every day. It's not. and we have the same people that are logged in every day. We just log in under a different email and entity, and we would pay you from a slightly different entity or a different entity as well. Okay. And so what we're looking for is just how do we make that work without keeping two different emails and everything else? Perfect, perfect. And so my first question, so the primary URL you have right now is the Titus International. Is this going to remain a separate database under that URL, or were you looking to have a new URL created, totally separate URL account, et cetera? Or have you even thought that far? Yes, it's the latter. It will be a separate. We have a domain and everything up, and I can send you that, Jim. Perfect. It'll be indexsearch.com, everything like that. The email, my email will switch. Victoria, who runs our operations, She runs all the recruiters. She's listening, and she will be the one that has the team that reports into her. So she's listening to see how it might impact her group. For sure. For sure. Perfect. So what we'll need to do is we will need to have that whole new account created with the new URL and everything like that. Probably, since we'll need a main contact, we'll probably want to do a whole new contract under that new name to get a new signer, new payer, everything like that. almost run it like it's a brand new company in general uh there okay um so we'll need who would be the the contract signer on the new organization would that be you matt i i will be yeah it's you can send it to because jim we don't have the email set up yet so you just send it to matt.deon and then at tygus.com perfect okay i will do that and then say different company names So the company is going to be Index Search Group. Same address, the 5247 Discovery Park? Oh, no, we're in the Florida location. Oh, okay. So I can send that to you, but it's 820 A1A North. I can send it to you, Jim. Okay. You'll send me an email. I'll get you all the information you need. Perfect, yes. So I'll need that proper company name, the address. I'll send it to you. And then we'll do the same pricing, same package. How many users? It looks like we have you at 27 now in TIGES. How many of those are going to leave TIGES and move over to index? It's almost a split in half. I think it's going to end up being 13 users, and then I think we're keeping the remainder, the 14. And I can get an update also. I'll...
