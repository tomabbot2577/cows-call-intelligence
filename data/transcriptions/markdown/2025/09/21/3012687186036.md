 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. My name is Connie Rose, and I'm with Raymond Alexander. I'm part of Financial Recruiters International with subsidiary. What other information do you need to follow my account? Let's see. Preferred talent. Did you say preferred talent solutions? No. My company is a subsidiary, and that is Raymond James. Excuse me. Okay. No, no, no, no, no. Let's back up. Oh, sorry. Keep saying that because it did business with them. Alexander Raymond. Alexander Raymond. Alexander Raymond. Gotcha. It's getting late. Yeah, no problem. If you don't find them, we'll put in Financial Recruiters International, maybe under that name. Okay. I'm in a parent company there we go okay cool so got you pulled up here oh I'm Connie Rose so I'm not sure on your if you see me I'm a new hire this is my I just got here Monday and so um what's happening is as I enter a name which I I have one I'm looking at right now. Across my toolbar, when I basically do the drop arrow, and it gives me all that are pinned that typically remain hidden. And so what I'm missing is details, and that has a lot inside that detail folder. I don't know why I'm missing it. That's weird. But looking here at the toolbar, and if you them share screen, I'd be glad to do that. It's missing and I don't know how to find it. Okay, yeah absolutely. So you have a name record pulled up and you have on the left there it'll start with like edit name and then you might have a resume tab. So that's the the tabs you're looking at there and you're missing details and when you click um you click the three horizontal lines at at the end of that list of tabs, details is not listed in there either? No. And I even brought in the owner of my box, and he couldn't leave it either. Gotcha. It's not there, and I'm like, no. All right. I will, let's fire up a screen share meeting. I've been hesitant to put any more resumes in there. I mean, I've only put two because I've been playing videos and learning how to use your software, and you can put in a bunch of bad data or leave a bunch of data out and then find yourself backtracking. So I don't want to go there. Yeah, that is a good, that's a smart way of looking at it. A lot of people don't have that philosophy and they shoot themselves in the foot a little bit. But yeah, I have a new meeting fired up. So just go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, this takes me to a Google page. Meetings.ringcentral.com. Yeah, meetings, plural, with an S, .ringcentral.com. So it should take you to – I thought you said that. Oh, sorry. Yeah, meetings.ringcentral.com. It's still taking me to Google. I don't understand this. Oh, are you typing this in the web address field rather than the search field? Absolutely. I told you I was new. Hey, I told you I was new. No worries. Caller alert. No worries. I'm so used to just going through the browser, right? Yeah. Okay, meetings.reamcentral.com. Exactly, yeah. It says, oops, I couldn't find the information that answers your question. I'm in the search bar. I'm still not in the right place, I don't guess. I'm in the search bar right across from the toolbar. Oh, so it should be way up at the top, the web address bar. You should be using that. It's where you enter the www dot up at the top of your screen. Yeah, that's what I was just doing. Okay. go to let's see here meetings you put in the with an s plural right yep okay and then a period and then ring central calm okay I'm gonna get it I don't know why I did it before I had a blank you know I had a blank browser okay so if that's working out you should get it yeah okay The meeting ID is going to be 525-750-780. 525-750-780. Perfect. Yep. Here we go. All right. If it asks you about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Okay, there we go. There you are. Go ahead and click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. I think that got the right one. I'm still getting used to... There we go. Does it show the PPR? So I'm looking at the RingCentral screen now. So if you want to, you can, if you have PCR open on a different screen, you could drag it over to this screen or. Let me go back in. That's what I was having trouble with because I could not tell. Let me stop share for a second. It can get funky. It can get real funky.
