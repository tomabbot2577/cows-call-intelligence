## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Rick Wolf. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing, Rick? I'm not doing the greatest right now. So you and I had worked the other day on companies, employees, and I tried pressing the VCR, and then it makes contact through the portal, and I couldn't find them. And then I think it was you who said that there was no company information in their card and we had to make a dummy company. And that worked at the time, but I can't remember what the dummy company was that we created. Oh, was it that you just had to type one in? Let me see if I had any notes. how detailed I take notes. Let me see. Did I... We did a screen share. Oh boy, I didn't really take good notes on this. just do another session and I'll show you where I am today maybe if that works yeah I'm trying to remember and I don't really do that feature that that wasn't a ticket right it was just like a call-in yeah yeah okay that's pretty bad because I usually take good notes on what we talk about so I can refer back to and apparently I did not on that one well it's okay hey you might pass back to the corporate fathers that when you guys are all busy and it says leave a message and we'll get back to you it's kind of like maybe someday we will it's not like we saved your place in line and then when that's up we'll call you right away if you follow me yeah it kind of just depends because you got people calling in and you got scheduled meetings like trainings and stuff like that. It's not always... No. Let me see. Okay, so you don't have RingCentral, if I remember right, correct? Right, correct. Okay, so I did a Google Meet with you. Do you want me to send it to the at M-E or at willowwolf.com email? Yeah, M-E is fine. Okay. New meeting, start an incident. I kind of remember this, yeah, because it was like some people was working and I remember it. I can't remember what we did. You figured out that some of the people, they didn't have the company filled in on the VCD card or whatever you call it. Okay. So we had to fill that in, but then we created a dummy company because that apparently had happened to someone I didn't know about it. But I can't for the life of me remember what that dummy company was. I wonder if we were just using the name of, you know, like every database has the default company. Maybe we're just typing that name in. This was top 300. Is that correct? right yes what is the name of your default company in that database that means help us top 300 company name of your default oh why is the name of your default company called Gordon Reese. What happened here? I don't know. That's a mistake. Let me see. Did it get changed? On 7-31, admin user changed it. I must have screwed up. On default. But you only have two people in there. Which is very, very strange. Where would you access default company from? So basically what the default company is for is like when you're not picking, like say if you're parsing a resume and you're not picking a company or if people are applying online, it's that fake company record that people would go into. Yeah. It's a company record, but it's got a fake name. how you can easily tell what it is, is if you go to company, and then over at the very far right, there's that office building icon. It says display default company. The problem is with this one. All right. The problem is with the one that's, hold on a second, the one that's coming up, It only has two names, which seems really odd. So let me see. Is there an excessive amount of people at one other company? Do you have PCR job board by any chance? I missed that. What did you say? Do you have the PCR job board by any chance? I don't know what that is. Oh. Is that in the My ECR? Is that where that is? It would be like if you had your job showing on your website. No, I don't have that. Okay. That's just really weird. Okay, let me see. Is there anything in Recycle Bin if it was ever deleted? Let me just do a little. Sure. That default company would be really old. Let's see. When was this record originally created? That might even tell us. They just always put them into activities. Oh, you created one. why don't you have a default company? Okay, I'm going to do a little script here. You might need to add one if there was already one that was supposed to be in there. I might rather bring back where that is. I thought we created a default company the other day, but I couldn't remember whether it was default company was the name. Yeah, and I don't see it deleted. I wonder if it got renamed or... Sorry I'm taking a while here, but... Don't worry. I want to make sure we do it right. You had a lot of people come down with the flu or COVID lately in your area? Mm-mm. Not that I have been hearing too much about it, to be honest. Both my wife and I did. Oh. My cousin said she was sick, but... Oof. That was available... All value default. Okay, let's see. All value... Order by... changed I'm going to se...
