## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. This is Robin. Hello. We have an account as a company with TC Recruiter, and I'm having one issue that I wanted to check on. Okay. What is your name? Yep. My name is Christy, C-H-R-I-S-T-I-E. Can you hear me one second there? Yep. Can you appear in your last name? Burgess, B-U-R-G-E-S-S. Okay. with connective services yep that's correct okay what can i help you with yeah so i sent out a mass email yesterday and it's showing on all of my candidates that i sent out the email but i didn't get any bounce backs and it's not showing in my sent email so it's showing it went to candidates but i have no responses or anything which is typically uh you know an issue so where do you Yeah, we'll take that. Let's see. Is this in the database called Connective Services or FinTech? Connective Services. Okay. And what username do you log in as? Christy at FinancialRecruiters.com. Or FinancialRecruitersInt.com. The PCR username. It wouldn't be a full email address. Okay. I'm in my PCR. I don't know what you're asking. So if you, so like when you write an activity, for example, what are those 10 characters that it writes? Okay, hold on one second. Let me go back to that. Okay, activities. That's like one way to tell. Okay, geez. Or if you're in Peace Recruiter right now, like your tab for Peace Recruiter, it'll say Peace Recruiter. And then right after that, on the actual tab, it'll say your username slash the database name. Okay, so I'm in PCR, and I am, okay, so I see my PCR company name, position, schedule, system. Where am I supposed to go for that? If you just look at the top, the actual browser tab, it'll say PC Recruiter, and if you hover on it, it'll tell you which username and database name you're logged in as. Okay, well, this says Connective Services and Style Sheet, so I'm not in the right place. It'd be the tab right above that. Okay. I don't really know where there's a tab above that. So I'm in the very first stage PCR, PCR or PCRecruiter.net. So what am I going to ask? It'd be the tab right above that, the actual tab, like how you can flip through tabs in your browser. If you hover on the tab of your main PCR screen, Okay. Okay. Sorry. I'm not. Let me start over. Okay. So I just logged into now PCR Recruiter. Okay. What was that username that it? So it's my capital, capital, my name, C-H-R-A-S-T-I-E backslash Connective Services. Okay. Christy. Okay. Yeah, sorry. It wouldn't do that until I started over. Okay. Yeah, normally, like, when you're in, it'll say, and then when parentheses, that's just one way without making you go out. Yeah, it didn't do that way unless I started over, but that's okay. Okay. All right. So, let me see one of your email alias list, which is what you're using to actually send the email. Yep. So, I see you have three. Yeah, you've done this before with me and you guys are amazing. It just keeps showing to all of my 200 candidates that it went through, but then it's not showing anything on my email or anything. So yes, I'm going to let you help me trouble. So I see you have more than one email alias list, which means when you go to send an email, your from is actually a dropdown that you could switch from. To bulk. Okay, so it is the bulk one. So that would be your send grid. Yeah. Let me test that one. Because it showed, because I tested all the candidates and they all got it. But then I didn't get any responses or out of office. And I was like, something's going on. So that is passing it. If you're using that second one that says Christy Balk, that is passing it directly to SendGrid. Now, I see you do have analytics. Was this sent as a mail campaign? Yes. Tell me where I should go so I can follow with you. So do I go to my roll-up list? Do you want me to go to a candidate that I would have sent this to? What do you want me to look at with you? If it was sent as a mail campaign, what you can do is at the very top right of PC Recruiter, there's a gear icon. Yep, got it. It'd be like hovering on the edge. Yep. Click on that and click background cash. Got it. Okay. Hold on. I'm opening that now. And I've done this with you before, but typically I get a bunch of bounce backs or responses, and I know no one's responded. So there's something going on. And I don't know if I just. show the beginning stages so let's see what's going on here was it the one called atl am and e ae yep okay and i just opened background tag and then it's not really it's all kind of gray it's not showing anything so i'm on right okay so that's so that you're probably under queued which means the ones that are actually running currently okay two completed so those are the ones that sent. Okay. And then those are the two that you've done according to the filters that I see for your username this month. Yep. Okay. So when you click on the one that with the name and it has 147. Yep. So here it's showing that they were sent. Yeah. Which means we did connect it to the mail server. But I haven't ha...
