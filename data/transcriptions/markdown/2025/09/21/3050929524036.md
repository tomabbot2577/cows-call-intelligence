## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, hi. This is Stephen Jacobs with Healthcare Recruiters International. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. So I spoke with Tyler a few minutes ago. I'm switching from a PC to a Mac, which is not fun. But anyway, he sent me a couple of links, yeah, a couple of URLs to get me set up on my new computer. And everything seemed to work fine. So I see the DC Recruiter icon on my desktop under applications. But when I click into it, it doesn't open. Well, you still need your database URL. Is that what you're referring to, like how to actually get to the database? but yeah there's no login screen where i put in my password right so he probably gave you what's called um amazon if you're on a mac amazon corretto and then a piece recruiter launcher which is really just a controls pack but it's basically what causes things to open or remember settings so you really need your your database url bookmarks in your browser it sounds like Is your email steve.jacobs at hcrnetwork.com? It is. Okay. I'm going to send you an email. I don't. Let's see. Yeah, there's like actually just a hyperlink. It's something that you bookmark that actually takes you to your login page. Oh. those are just some extra steps that you need for things to work right once you get there okay sending that over to you let me know when you get it let's see here Let's refresh here and see. There it is, Robin. Okay, so did I just click into that? Yeah, you'll want to bookmark that. That's what actually takes you to your organization's login page. So you would want to have that bookmarked. Do I, remind me, I mean, I've bookmarked many times. Do I actually click into the URL first or do I right-click on the URL and not open it to bookmark it? I think I have to click it. If you click the link, it'll open that link up in your browser. Okay. Gotcha. And then I just bookmarked that. Okay. Okay. So now I see where I am. And then I just put in my regular stuff. Got it. Yeah. The first time you log in, you'll probably get a prompt about opening PCR URL and things like that. Did you do those other links that he sent you? I did. Okay, so the first time you log in, go ahead and log in now. Let's make sure you get them. Okay, let's see here. Because your browser is going to prompt you. Let me just bookmark it first. Here's the PC recruiter. Do it like that. Okay, let me just click in there. Let's see, username. Username. All right. Let's see what it does. All right. Open PCR URL. I'm going to say always. Yeah, check the box. And then open. And then the first time it will also ask you to allow an update. You'll hit allow. So the first thing it says is systems events. Would you like to access files in your documents folder? Yes. Yeah, definitely want to say yes there. I thought that came after. A newer version of the controls is required. Say allow. Yes, the allow one, yeah. I had the order of those two apparently flipped. I mean looking at a math it's it's just a foreign thing altogether it's not the same no I don't know what it's very different I don't know if it's doing anything I I mean I clicked into that okay yeah but you said allow yep okay try this this is how we'll know if it's working go to a name record that you know has an attachment? Well, oh, well, so it's all disappeared from my screen. So I don't, I don't have a way to access it. What do you mean? So are you in the database now? No. No, I'm staring at my desktop. What does it say? So the only thing I've got, so I've just got my desktop up and it's gone. So when I click that allow, it just, the little window disappeared. Okay. So go back to your login page. Try logging in again. This time you should not. Let's see. Do not show this in the future. Skip. Okay. Sounds like you're in. That sounded like one of our notes. That was really weird. Really weird. So I'm going to save my password. Password saved this device. To get your passwords, more in Chrome, the password will be saved. Well, I don't know if I want to sign into Chrome. Anyway, it looks like I'm in. Yeah, I don't know what's going to happen. Yeah, it looks like I'm in right now. So everything looks okay as far as I can tell. Let me just try company real quick. But I don't know what to do with signing into Chrome. I mean, it's just so different. Yeah, it's all there. It's all there. I just don't know. If I close this window, let me see where it is. So I'm going to have to go into Chrome each time. Unless you download Edge. And then look for my bookmarks. Yeah, you have to open up Edge, but then you're going to have to kind of save the bookmark in Edge. I don't know if you have that on your computer. Oh, Edge is in the browser? Yeah, so Chrome is a browser. Oh, yeah, I don't. Edge is the reason why I've got a Mac Pro. Edge is, I think everybody who developed Edge should be in federal penitentiary. So what happened was, you know, Edge used to be a fairly innocuous browser. But what M...
