## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. It's Brianna with Bradbury Miller. How are you this morning? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing all right, thanks. I really missed the chat feature that you guys had for help, but I guess a phone call will work too. Yeah. Is that not an option anymore? I know it was like one day. I don't know if they brought it back or not. a lot of things that go in there really shouldn't be in there. In the chat? Yeah. I get a lot of people, oh, what's my password? Oh. Oh, yeah. That's probably like half of them. I can't log in, what's my password? It's like, yeah, this isn't ideal here. No, that makes sense. Yeah, that's probably a big reason for it. now that your your support staff have better things to do than be like okay click on reset my password well it's also just a big security thing too so yeah um yeah we don't as you probably know we don't reset anybody's passwords um we don't like we the only way we reset a password for somebody well first of all they're they're masked they're not visible at all and then um people have to go to their administrator because there could be a reason that the password is not working. Right. And then, like, even if, like, if there was no way for any administrator to go in and set a password, we would only reset a password if the administrator, like the person that signed the contract, signs a form. So we're very, very cautious about that. So it's just. Yeah. There's a lot of personal information in this database. So I get it. Yeah. you get like some of the disgruntled employee wants to leave and, you know, they'll call us up. Oh, I need to be able to export. It's like, no, you better go to your administrator for changing your securities. Yeah. We don't change anything like that. So how to protect you guys. Right. No, we appreciate it. There's a lot, there's a lot of information in this thing. So anyways, I was having the reason for my call is because I, you know, like we use the presentations to share our candidate information with our clients. And sometimes the candidates don't have all of their paperwork completed. So typically what we do is we update the presentation and then let them know that the presentation has been updated. So I went into the candidate presentation overall list, found the presentation that I needed to update. I updated it. It looked good. Like I viewed the presentation through the candidate presentation overall list. But then when I go to view that presentation using the link that I sent the client, the update isn't happening. I refreshed my window. I opened it in an incognito tab. And still the document that I added is not there. But when I view it in the list, it's fine. And I can't create another list from that. So is there any way you can help me figure that out or does it not work like that? I'll be honest. I haven't done too much with changing a presentation. So there's edit existing link. Okay. Let me see what happens here. Where would I have this link? I'd probably have to play around with it. Now, when you make the change to the presentation, do you go, like, to the Canvas record and go to presentations and use the edit presentation link? No, because it's a presentation with 10 candidates in it. Okay. So do you start from the position and go to presentations and then edit? I go to system and then the system, presentations, candidate presentation overall list. Okay. I'm going to honestly have to play around with it to confirm or give you any further details. Okay. Can I do that and then get back to you? Yes, you can. And also, I've got your email about the other issue that I brought up a couple days ago about the automation. I'm going to forward that on to Karen so Karen can fix it. So thank you so much for the work that you did on that. I really appreciate it. No problem. And I'll follow up with an email just so it's tracked that. I got it. I appreciate it. But, yes, thank you so much for your – it's just been a crazy week. I get it. your that too um and um do you need me to open a ticket or will you open a ticket here you know i'm going to open one let's see yeah i'll be honest going me through emails anymore it's just there's just too many so tickets are easier because then they're gonna status okay so and that's brianna bradbury miller right that's your email okay so um changes to presentation hold on one second I got to answer somebody hey Jim can you hold for just a moment okay okay can just presentation sorry whatever okay and then you're going in there and you're like adding documents like from attachments is that what you're doing yes so the way that we have like the candidate like the presentation set up so they can see their resume and like a questionnaire or like a couple questionnaires and so you know when somebody doesn't turn their questionnaire in before i send the information we like to be able to update that link and i've had success doing it before so i don't know why it's no...
