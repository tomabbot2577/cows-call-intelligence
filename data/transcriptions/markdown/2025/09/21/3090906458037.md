## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Ashley McCarthy. I am a worker for CWP Technical. And so I'm fairly new, and I'm working through PCR. But there's a few options in PCR that I don't have access to that I'm hoping that maybe you can just kind of click a button for maybe, and you don't have to code or anything crazy. But I am actually missing the configure button to merge two or multiple profiles of the same person. And I also am having difficulty with the plug-in for the PCR capture. So I have the PCR capture installed, and then I've got it on my Chrome extensions, but then when I hit it, like, yeah, take me to this, it sends me to a website and it just says blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, PCR slash backslash my company. And I don't even know if that's the right, like. Oh, okay. Yeah, I can help you with that. So as far as permissions for users, we aren't able to adjust that for security reasons. Someone on your team, your system administrator, would have to give you or adjust your permissions. Okay. So right now I just checked for the Ashley username, allow record merging as it's set at no permission. So you could request that your system admin switches that to full permission for your username. When it comes to the capture tool, where it has that web address with my company at the end, it's kind of just placeholder text. So it actually needs your PCR web address. So if you have PCR pulled up in a new tab or something, you can just copy that full web address at the top and paste it into the capture tool to link the capture tool to your account. Okay. So let me, okay, hold on. Because when I pull up PC, so I need to be logged in the PCR period. So to start with. You can be either logged in or you can just go to the login page for PCR. That web address will work, whatever you see at the top there. Okay. Okay, I'll copy that and then you see I enter your PCR site URL. It's not even giving me the option to change it. Like it's letting me highlight it. It's kind of just placeholder text. As soon as you start typing, it'll disappear or if you paste something in there, it'll paste over top of it. So if you put like your cursor by the H in the HTTP and start typing, it'll go away. then I was asking for my username and password and database all over again. Is that? Yeah. Yeah. So enter your PCR username and password. Oh, I don't remember what those are because I already had those saved. Oh, um, I know that the username is Ashley, um, but we don't have access to passwords, unfortunately. Yeah. Oh, Ed. Okay. Uh, let me see if I can go figure this out. Uh, password. Um, There's no, like, little eyeball to tell me. Okay. Okay, well, at least I know how to fix this now, so I'll see if I can find this in my notes, and then, worst case, I'll just call Ed back. So, okay, great. So, basically, all of the issues are on our side, so that's perfect. So, okay. Well, thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, if you do have more questions or things come up, just let us know, and, yeah, we'll walk you through them. Awesome. Thank you, Garrett. I appreciate you. Have a good one. Bye. You too. Take care....
