## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Mr. Garrett, this is Tom Zeleny calling from Denver. I've got a really quick question for you that you'll probably be able to answer in 10 seconds. So real simple. Can a user run an integration like SourceWale through the PCR app, or does it have to be through a Chrome browser? Yeah, it would have to be through the Chrome browser. I don't think it connects through. Yeah, it doesn't connect to the app. I don't think any integration really works well with the app. Yeah, with the app, you can click on the little puzzle piece at the top and SourceWale is listed. And then if you do the three dots, you say integrate, but nothing happens. Gotcha, yeah. I think based on I think SourceWale is the one who made that integration. So, yeah, based on what I've seen, it doesn't really interact well and mobily. But, yeah, I think that's the case with most of the integrations with PCR. It all kind of requires the full version of PCR on the computer. OK. OK, well, I've just always used the app on my computer, because if I don't have to have the Chrome toolbar, I have more real estate that I can see on contacts and companies and things like that. I know it's minor. It takes like two lines, but I can get a lot in in two lines. That makes sense, yeah. So I like using the app on my PC for that reason, but I'll just switch over to using the browser version. Gotcha. Yeah, I think that would work better with the source whale piece. Okay. Sounds like a plan. Well, I knew you'd be able to answer it in a matter of moments. So thank you so much for confirming. Happy to help. Yeah, reach out if you have any other questions. Okay, will do. Thanks, Garrett. Thanks. Bye....
