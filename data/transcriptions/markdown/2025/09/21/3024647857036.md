## 💬 Full Transcript

 Here we go. That's right now. Hi, Jim. Hopefully this will be better. Hi there. Do you hear me okay? Yeah, we do. Awesome. Yeah, sometimes a speaker, it's trying to quiet it because it's hearing or something, the echoes sometimes cause that to act a little weird. Okay, so looking at PC Recruiter, so kind of one of the biggest changes is going to be that the menu bar is down the left-hand side. A lot of these are going to be the same terminology as you're used to. Some of them may be the same screen. So you see like the analytics and sequences, for example, those are the identical screen as is in PCR 9. Because when these two features were designed, we were already working on PCRM. So thus, they work just the same. So you'll be able to look at your exact same analytics, your exact same sequencing. Those two are very much the same. I think the schedule is also pretty much the same because that though it's pushed in the new interface, it kind of looks the same. But we have made some big changes to how the names, the companies and the positions look Something useful. We did is we took and we made it so that all three all three screens work the same. So if you go into the screen, you're going to have an area here where you see your most recently viewed records. You're going to have the ability to edit in line. So you can edit right on the main menu there. You could take a number of actions right from here. You can contact them via email, call, SMS. You can add an activity, add a note, add them to a roll-up. So you can do some different things through here right off of the main screen here. Then if you click on the icon, that's going to open the screen. It's going to slide in from the far right, and it's going to be entirely configurable. Now what's nice about this is if you know how to use the interface, you can go to Companies, all the same stuff, just Company Records. So it's going to be very easy for newer users to pick up and it's a lot easier to use, a lot easier to figure out. It just makes more sense is what people have told me. So if you're looking at the record, what we've now done, a lot of these areas up here are going to be the same terminology you're used to, resumes, activities, notes, keywords. But what we've added is we've actually added something called workspace. And that's going to essentially be your default workspace. When you land on a record, this is going to give you kind of your workspace, the main page you're going to look at. You can put kind of your commonly used fields, maybe the resume, maybe the activities. So you want to show some of the basic information right on that workspace. Then you can delve deeper into any of these if you want to look at what roll-up lists the person is on. Or you want to look at their notes or their resumes. One thing we've done is we've given you the ability to add, I think, unlimited resumes here. So you can kind of title additional resumes, put different tabs in here. Where you see I have two, you can keep adding them on through there. So you can have multiple resumes in there. Another cool thing we've done with the interface when you're looking at the keywords, if you're tagging people, you can actually right-click and you can tag that up in the main, kind of in the header. Up at the top, kind of next to Terry's name, I've got three keyword tags that I've put up there at the top. So it gives you some different tagging capabilities in there as well. Another thing I like about the records, if I go into details, I have a nice easy search here. So if I'm looking for phone number fields, I just type in phone. It's going to filter those instantly. Or if I need to see my foreign language fields, see what language he might speak, I can type in that. Or I can even type in any possible languages I might have. So I can kind of instantly search all the data, kind of zero in on what I'm looking for there. So a lot of these and these are cool because if you want to move your attachments over I just drag it It's going to snap over real time So you see the interface is a little easier to configure than it has been in the past Now you're still going to have your names your companies your positions the positions are still going to have the same pipeline So if I go into my position menu again same same Functionality is the name menu, but if I go into a position I'm going to be able to open up that position record. It is going to be configurable. It also has a workspace and then your details is all of your fields. The pipeline is going to remain the same. So the pipeline that you're working with there, same exact pipeline. It works within here so that's going to look and work just the same. Okay, so a lot of it is kind of familiar, same terminology, new layout, new format there. Some things that are new that have have been added to PCRM. One is going to be the deals workflow. So the deals workflow is going to be like a sales pipeline, a sales funnel, if you will. And it...
