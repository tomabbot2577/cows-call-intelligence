## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, you are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. That's me. Good afternoon, Mr. Jim. Hey, Jim. How's it going? Not bad. Not bad. How are you? Good. Doing well, thanks. Thanks. Appreciate you jumping on. You ready for the fourth? We are. We are. We are closing down the next couple of days, so we have a couple day-long weekend, so that's good. That's good. Yes, it is. That's great. Okay, and we're going to take a look today at PCRM. Brian's going to join us as well in a bit. We were just on a call a half hour ago, so I just talked with him. That was cool. Great. So I wanted to kind of see a little bit what you were thinking, what you'd heard. Is there things really that's lacking in PCRecruiter? What is your kind of general feel for things? yeah um so we we actually probably like 2021 started working with uh sales loft mainly for business development purposes um i think i was before sequencing was on pcr did a deal pipeline you know all those reasons so we started working heavily with that It costs money, right? So we've recently decided, and it's two different systems, so that's always an issue and an issue there. And so now we're looking for one system, right? And I know PCRM came out, which is great. So that interests us and the features there. We also, we do a couple of things, right? So we sell executive search and we sell a robust, transparent search process to our clients. So they see every candidate that we map, every candidate we vet, every candidate, you know, all the documents, all the screening forms. So, a client portal is important to us. And I know you all have an older version of that. I don't know if you have a newer version. And so, what's important to us at this point, right, is tracking our deals, the business development piece, you know, prospecting, getting people in our deal pipe, in our deal funnel to earn new business for new searches and being able to track all that and have a process for doing that and then being reminded. And then recruitment-wise is being able, you know, to run them through the, basically the recruitment pipeline and funnel, which we're very used to PCR. Our challenge with PCR, as you all know, and I'm giving you all my feedback on this. I appreciate it. But the challenge with PCR is there's a lot of clicks. Things can be hidden, right, behind just viewing-wise. That's a challenge for us with PCR. and then the client portal was a challenge with us. We did use the monday.com through Carbon Web. That was great, but there was a lot of duplicate efforts too. We had to kind of update things, right? It wasn't smooth and clean. And we sold that for a while, but that also was extra money as well. So we're at a point now of like, what's the best system for us at the lowest cost? And because we're a part of SRA, you know, there is Crelate is a big partner there. So we've taken a look at that and they offer a lot of great things. We saw PCRM and it seems like they've redone things to make the layout look better. some tagging features, right, organizational things that we really like. So, and all of our data is with PCR, right? And we worked with you all for so long, and we like you guys. And so we're at a point where we really need a system that does everything in one place. It's kind of our want. And I don't know if I missed anything, Dad, feel free to jump in. Well, let me add to that in that Julian has spent too much time administratively trying to make things connect together. So our goal is to get it where he doesn't have to do that because the system operates and therefore he can use his time for its most valuable is in connecting with clients and candidates. And as he's mentioned, you know, I've been on PCR since 2008, so a long time. We appreciate what's there, but it's apparent that PCRM may be getting there, getting it more streamlined to what other things we see in the marketplace. And we don't want changes to change. We'd rather work with PCR and just have it be more efficient. So I think that's what our goal is. Sure. Sure. I get that. Do you hear this from other people or not? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So a lot of what kind of seems what you're looking for, a lot of what we have. The only big thing we don't have right now is a client portal. So that is still something. I've heard discussions. I've heard people specking it out. There's demand. People are asking for it. I don't think there's anything currently in the pipeline for that. But we do have just about everything else. So the PCRM is going to give you a newer, less click-heavy interface. It's going to give you the same position pipeline that you've worked with, but it's also going to give you the new deals pipeline, which is kind of a separate area, like a sales funnel, a whole separate area, and it's going to give you the ability to track all your deals, see where everything stands. It's totally customizable. You...
