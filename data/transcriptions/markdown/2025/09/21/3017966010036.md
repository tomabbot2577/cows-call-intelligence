## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Brian. Brian, this is Dylan Andrews with Russ Attic Associates. How are you? Good, Dylan. What's going on? Well, I am attempting to try out your AI on our PCR database, and it's not allowing me to do it. What did tech support say? I can't get okay somebody just texted me and said thank you I'm able to nope that was somebody else my bad I couldn't get a hold of anybody that's the answer so I'm trying to follow the prompts on your website here it says go to do you know prompt one here hit this button to get to somebody on the phone so somehow it got me to you so I'd love to go Okay, so I'm in sales. You hit one, and that gets you to sales. And unfortunately, you got forwarded out to my cell phone because I'm out of the office. So I can't ring you back to support. But if you hit option two, when you dial that main number instead of one, you get tech support. If you don't get an answer, it means they're probably helping somebody else leave voicemail. You can also send an email to support at main sequence dot net. That will automatically open up a ticket. So that has to be resolved. So that's beneficial. Well, I did that yesterday and it did not and has not been contacted since yesterday. I apologize. That's a bummer. what part of which of the four AI sections are you trying to utilize I don't know they said that there's AI now for PCR so I'm trying to use anything have you requested that it be turned on in your database yet have we it was supposed to be supposed to be turned on but it's still not available oh okay so let me let's do this go to a name record. Okay. And you may or may not have this on your menu, but the summary section, if you could, it may be under edit name, notes, activities, that, that menu, but it may not be pinned. You may have to hit the three arrow, three lines. I went there. Okay. So the summary, the very last, icon on that menu is our is a version of our new image it's a hexagon are you seeing that yeah okay so what happens in the summary section if you click that it will create a summary of starting with of that person's record starting with their resume I believe it will also grab attachments and information in their field level so that's the first section that's the first area where AI plays part second area is searching so if you go that's what I want bar at the top if you go click on the bar the search bar at the top of the screen I'm there yeah okay and then you see the AI button and if you click that on no there's no a okay so this is not was the ai button in the summary section yeah okay okay but that's not okay interesting um let's do this um So, I'm going to say, was your first name Dylan? I apologize. Yeah, that's correct. Okay. I'm going to say, Dylan, that it probably hasn't been turned on yet. even though you're seeing it in that summary section. If it's not in the, if you don't see the AI button in the top left-hand corner of the quick search box when you click on that search box. Okay, so it hasn't, something somehow has not been turned on for you yet. So, Dylan, what was your last name? Andrews. I'm with SRA and Next Level Exchange is the name of the company that we all work with. So, Brian Denton is the one. If you could, Dylan, you are not in our database. is the name of the office that you are in? Russ Haddock Associates. Okay. Once again, we're under SRA, Sanford Road Associates. Right. Do you normally go through SRA for PCR support or do you normally call us directly? Well, we usually, they have abilities, their support team has abilities to do some things in PCR for us, but sometimes I have to go directly to main sequence for an answer. So that's the answer to that. Got it. So, Russ Haddock, H-A-D-D, I would assume. Not seeing that. One D. Is there another? One D. One D. R-U-S-S-H-A-D-I-T-K-A-N-D, Associates. I'm sorry, Dylan. I don't know what you were saying there. I wasn't tracking that. Could you start again? Russ space Haddock with one D. Okay. space a and got it found it found it thank you okay thank you apologize i was i was so that was the yeah you're good you're good all right um okay and you said you sent an email into support at Main Sequence asking to turn on it. Brian Denton did. Brian Denton did. Great. Okay. And copied me on it and Bob Haddock. Oh, that would be... Yeah. That's awesome. Would you mind forwarding that to me so I could utilize that to try and help get this resolved for you? My email is Brian, B-R-I-A-N at Brian M as in Michael Cain, C A I N E.com. So it's Brian at Brian M Cain.com C A I N E. You don't have a main sequence email. I do, but that's the one I use. I'm a contractor for them. I'm not an employee. I've been a contractor for them for 20 years. So I just use my own email and I have services I provide, you know, tech support, training and consultation, maximizing PCR, that kind of thing.
