## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Listen, I'm having a bit of an issue replying back to emails. Not sure if anybody else has reported this, but when you try to reply, the window doesn't show quite right, so you can't really send anything. Oh, yeah. So sometimes when we push a tiny update out to the software, certain computers will need a clearing of the cache to have everything displayed correctly again. I can walk you through those steps here. So pull up the page that is having the issue, so just anywhere in PCR. And then at the top right, go to the three dots at the top right of your browser. Go to More Tools, towards the bottom, Developer Tools. And that'll open up some coding and stuff that you could just kind of ignore. and then you want to go to right near your web address the WWW dot at the top to the left of that right click on the refresh button and if you right click on it it'll give you a drop down with a few options right so I'm stuck with just everything for a moment because I'm trying to get to develop developer tools which open developer tools okay so it opens up the tab with the developer tools is that what we're looking for yes if that will open up and you could just ignore that leave that off to the side and then right click on the refresh button to the left and then it'll give you the option empty cache and hard reload okay click on that it'll slowly reload the page and refresh it and you can then close the developer tools and then test that again see if it's still giving you the same display issue okay so now it's reloading okay cool okay now it's done reloading going back to the inbox and then I'm going to click on an email here and then reply oh it worked awesome yes okay yes that'll happen if If we, on some computers, you know, if we do push out an update, so clearing cache will help with that. Yeah. Any other issues you've been having or any other problems in PCR? Not really. Everything's been working just, I think, yesterday. I started having that trouble with other windows. But, yeah, when you replied to an email, it just kind of showed you, like, an empty window with a few buttons. And I thought that was weird, but it looks like that fixed it. So thank you for your help. Awesome. Yeah, no problem. I guess, yeah, just reach out if you have any other questions. Sounds good, Garrett. Thanks for your help. Thanks. Bye....
