## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Brianna. I'm calling from Mutual of Omaha Mortgage. We're working on a mortgage loan for a current employee of the company, and I'm struggling to determine how I can request an employment verification. Hopefully you can help. Oh, I am not sure on that. But who are you trying to reach? Your human resources department, your payroll department, anybody who's in the administrative side of the business. Okay. One second. Let me see here. All right. I couldn't get a hold of my supervisor. He must be on a call right now. I will send you to my supervisor's voicemail, and if you leave a message, She'll get back to you with the information you need. All right. Awesome. All right. Sending you over now. His name is Nick. And, yeah, he'll get back to you as soon as he gets the voicemail. Okay. All right. Have a great rest of your day. Bye....
