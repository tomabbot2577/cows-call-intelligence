## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. We spoke before. It's Elizabeth Frias. It's professionalemployment.com. And I was having trouble with my outlet again. And it's saying a pop-up window comes up that PC recruiter is in error. It's not connecting. So I was just going to ask you how to do that. Oh, okay. How do we connect? So you're opening Outlook Classic, right, not Outlook New? Well, I think we're trying to set up new, right? Or are we in classic? We're trying to do the new, although I've had the old previously. Okay, good. Yeah, so PCR Outlook Portal is only compatible with Outlook Classic. We won't be compatible with Outlook New. Oh, so then I only can use Outlook. Classic then. Okay. Right, with the PCR. Okay, so then I didn't know that. But that's good to know, because maybe I started having a problem with Outlook since Friday, and I couldn't figure out what's going on. But I've been on Classic all the time. We were just doing it right now to do the new, but I think we'll go back to the old then, the Classic. Okay. And then once I'm on there, how do I, because I was on there and it still had that error message, How do I get PC recruiters to start working on the Classic? I might have to take a look. We might have to do like a screen share. So the message is, is it saying that your license is expired, or is it saying that you need a serial number? It's an error message. And my husband, I'm not sure where he's at right now, but we'll go back to Classic, and then I'll call back. I'll have to call back because he's not there right now. Well, by now I'm trying to open it up, but it's not opening. No, because you're going to new Outlook. We have to go to classic. The best way to open classic is if you just want to use the search bar at the bottom of your screen by the Windows logo. Type in Outlook there. And you should see search results where you have Outlook classic and Outlook new as options. And just make sure to click on the classic one. Okay. Sometimes when you move to new. We're not doing the new. I know that. Okay. But when you press the button down there, it's automatically right now trying to open the new. Oh, that's easy to fix. You go back to Outlook. Oh, okay. I'll let you do that. All right. That's the classic. Okay. So then we have to go to, what is it saying? We detected a problem with launching your new Outlook. Please try again later. We don't want to go to new Outlook. We don't want to do that. Okay. So then just click okay because we don't want to do that. And then click skip. And then so then how do I get it to work again, the PC part? So do you see PC Recruiter listed in your main menu of Outlook at the top? Yes. It's up here. Yes. Okay. So you should be logged in. Does it say anywhere under that Easy Recruiter tab? It's already logged in. I'm in. I'm in. I think it fixed itself. Oh, good. I'm going to go back to old. Perfect. Just my sent file in Outlook is completely gone, so I'm going to have to go back to my hosting company for my email and ask them to help me on that. That's what I'm going to have to do. Oh, gotcha. Okay, well, thank you so, so much. Okay, yeah. Unless you can help me. Do you know, since I went back to Classic and my whole sent file was gone, don't leave me because you're my techie. Okay. So how do I, do you have any idea how I can get my sent file back? It's like one of the folders on your folder list on the left. That's missing. The sent folder is missing. The sent folder is missing. I am not sure. Yeah, that might be a connection between your email provider and Outlook type issue. Okay, I've got to go to the email. Okay, sounds good. I'll try that. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. I would definitely remove the Outlook new icon. It might be the one that's sitting on your taskbar at the bottom or on your desktop, so it doesn't try to open Outlook new each time. Okay, get rid of that one. Yeah. Yeah, and then maybe when you use the search bar at the bottom of your screen, you can look for Outlook Classic and find a way to pin that one instead. Yeah, it's pinned already. You're right. Oh, good. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. Reach out if you need anything else. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Thanks. Thank you....
