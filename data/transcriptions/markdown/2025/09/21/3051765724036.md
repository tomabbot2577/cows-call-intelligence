I know we worked on getting the bulk email set up for one of the employees. I want to know, are we able to do the same thing with the admin account? So can the admin have access to send out bulk emails as well? Yeah, let me pop into your account here. Take a look. So what's the email address that you'd be using for the admin account? It would be Heather at. So let me take a look here. Do you still have that API key saved that we copied before? Okay.
