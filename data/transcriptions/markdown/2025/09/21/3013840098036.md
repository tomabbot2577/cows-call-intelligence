## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling FloraSearch. If you know your party's extension, please enter it now. For a general inquiry, press 111. For Jack Farrell, 115. Bob Zara, 116. Martin Zara, dial 114. Judy Devine, 112. Lori Hollingsworth, 111. To hear this message again, dial 111. Floor Search, this is Lori. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a voicemail that you're having trouble in PCR. Yeah, from Friday. Awesome. Are you still having that issue? Yeah, I was just trying to export some data, and it always used to work, but it didn't work on Friday. Okay. I was able to do real small roll-ups, but not all of them. Gotcha. How many records were on the larger roll-ups that were giving you trouble? 49,000. Okay, yeah. Those will time out. Yeah, it won't be able to keep connecting to the server for that long to get that many records. So you probably would have to break those down into smaller roll-ups. I think people have been able to do like 9,000, 10,000 sometimes without the timing out, but 49,000 will definitely time you out. Okay. Yeah, for some reason I thought that I was able to do it before, but I guess not. Yeah, I'm doing it the other way. I just I thought that I had done it before. I just walked in the office. Sorry, I'm kind of scattered here. Yeah, no problem. Well, yeah, if you still are having trouble after breaking those down into a little bit smaller roll ups, just let us know and we'll continue to troubleshoot. OK, sounds good. I appreciate the call back. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye-bye....
