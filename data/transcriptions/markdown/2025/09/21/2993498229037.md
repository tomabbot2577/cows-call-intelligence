## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Robin.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** Hey, what's up?

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Sorry.

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Hey, no problem.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** Kevin Saylor, I talked to him.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Kevin Saylor can kiss it.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** Why can he kiss it?

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** Have you talked to him?

**[0:14] Speaker_00:** Have you ever worked with him?

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** Oh, yeah.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** He direct emails me all the time.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** He sent me an email.

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** Actually, he sent something.

**[0:21] Speaker_01:** I had one voicemail from him from 5 o'clock yesterday, and then he emails Nick saying nobody's on support.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** It's like, well, you literally called and hung up.

**[0:31] Speaker_01:** Didn't even leave a message.

**[0:33] Speaker_01:** Like, dude.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** He sent the email to me saying, what's going on with support?

**[0:39] Speaker_00:** I can't get anyone.

**[0:40] Speaker_00:** And I didn't see that he tried to do anything.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** There's nothing.

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** I'm like, Nick, could you call this person?

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** And he just sent them to you, I guess.

**[0:48] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[0:49] Speaker_00:** But then I just called.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** I emailed him back yesterday saying, well, okay, what do you need?

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** I received a missed call from you, but no message was recorded.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** and did you need assistance?

**[0:59] Speaker_01:** No reply.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so he's set up a new user.

**[1:05] Speaker_00:** He's actually added a bunch of users, but we hadn't been monitoring it, so we didn't know.

**[1:08] Speaker_00:** So I'm putting in a user ad ticket for him too.

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** But his new user, he needs to, I think, set up IMAP, I think.

**[1:15] Speaker_00:** He's saying like somebody did it before for him that getting the folders into PC Recruiter, as best I can understand, it sounds probably like IMAP, and then something about the API key to set up some caller thing.

**[1:29] Speaker_00:** There's no longer a sign-up.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** They just kind of, yeah, they just, there is no sign-up for it.

**[1:37] Speaker_01:** There is no API key needed anymore.

**[1:40] Speaker_01:** They just kind of put in their database, they need username, password, that's it.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** I tried to get from him kind of what it was to at least gauge what we needed for him and to give him a touch to get him pleased.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** And I told him, I said, so you know, I said, maybe he'd been emailing Josh.

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** I hadn't gotten any emails, but I said, Josh is no longer here.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** And he goes, oh, what about Tyler?

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** I'm like, he's no longer here either.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** So he may have been reaching out to people that weren't there.

**[2:08] Speaker_00:** So I said, we've had some changes, a little bit of reconfiguration.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** So we're still okay.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** And he was calm.

**[2:15] Speaker_00:** I was like, oh, okay.
