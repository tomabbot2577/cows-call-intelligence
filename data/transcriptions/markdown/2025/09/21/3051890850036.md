## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Good morning. I have a quick question for you. Yeah, what's going on? And I know I've called about this before, but I forget how to do it. So I just need to see where I can, like when I'm in a candidate record, where I can show the activity types that are visible and where it's set up throughout the entire system. yes so you just want to know like where the list of them are where you can set them yeah i like i can set i know where to set um why didn't that go yeah i need to see i thought i added one here linkedin message yeah um actually i thought i said yeah so i need to i know if i'm in activity types, I can hit add and I can set that up, but I need to see where the, where, you know, where I can select which activities I want visible. Cause some of the system stuff. And when I add somebody in, you know, like there's different things that I just don't need to see. It just, you know, makes it a lot of congested in there. So I just want to see the list, all the important activities for each record. Gotcha. So when you're on a name record, and you go to the activities screen. Yep. In that options menu, you'll see a default filters section. Activities. Is that in the drop down? Oh, default filters. Okay. And then those default activity types. Okay. Those are the ones that you can select, and those will be the ones that display. Gotcha. So I just take one from the available items and move it over to the selected items? Exactly. Okay. All right. Perfect. That's all I needed to know. All righty. You have yourself a great rest of the day. All right. Thanks, man. You do the same. Bye-bye....
