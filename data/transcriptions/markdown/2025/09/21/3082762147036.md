## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. How are you? Good. My name is Mark Goodstein. I'm with TechPros. And I had a question. I'm in the pipeline section. and I'm wondering why you know like when you so you can either do when you're sending you can either send a resume like you can either you can either do something and not excuse me and not send an email or you can send an email okay and you can toggle that over if you if you don't if you're not going to send an email to somebody and you just want to notate the movement in, in, um, okay. Then what's interesting is like, for example, if I'm doing this against a job, a job opening and like the person, the hiring manager is listed down below in the, you know, in the send email section. But when you, when you, when you do the drop-down menu, he's not listed there. So I have to type in his name to actually utilize that feature, and I'm just wondering if that's how it's supposed to be. Oh, is it the drop-down menu that has for the interviewer? Yep, it says add interviewers. And because his name is in the grayed-out area where it says send email or resume, okay his name doesn't show up in the drop down menu of adding interviewers okay so that interviewer drop down at first will show you anybody that is at the uh their name record is associated with that company that you're filling the job order for so if you pull up um the hiring authority uh if you pull up his name record does it have him listed at that company No. Oh, yes. Oh, okay. He's listed at the company. I mean, I'll double check, but I just don't understand why his name should show up in that drop-down menu. Let me just double check. Right. As long as his name is at that company that the job order is for. Yeah, he's only in one record. so his name should show up in that drop-down menu and it doesn't. Okay, let me pull up your database. I'll take a look. Okay. Logging in now. And then what is the hiring authority's name? His name is Gary Hofstein. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, his name record is at Security Lock Distributors. Is that the company you're fulfilling the position for? Yeah, so I'm actually in the pipeline section. I'm trying to send the resume of Jeremy Morgan. And I noticed this yesterday, but, you know, like, I just, like, it just seems odd that his name doesn't show up in that drop-down list. Right, so Gary's is not showing up? Exactly. But if you look at the, like, the send email section, his name is in there, but it's grayed out. Okay. security lock distributors. So I'm looking at the security lock distributors company record, and there are not any position records associated with it. So your, your job order, your position is not with security lock distributors. That must be why, you know, that he, Gary is with that company, but the position is not listed with that company. Hold on a sec. Yeah, I have it. I have the position, and it's listed with the company. What's the position's name? It's DeskSide Help Desk Engineer Dallas. oh i found it so that uh position record is associated with a company called sc clock c clock yeah that is a different um position it's a different company record than where gary's at Gary's associated with a company record called Security Lock Distributors, which is different than SC Clock. Okay, let me just – oh, that's interesting. Okay, so let me just look for a second. So SecLock names. Okay, so let me get back. The position and Gary were both – that's where he would appear on the drop-down for interviewers. Let me just go to Security Lux. So if I – that explains it. Okay. So I need to change – can I edit the name and how do I – let's see. I'm going to go to Gary's name record. There should be in the action menu a change company button. Can I merge companies? Oh, yeah, yeah, you could do that. Hold on. I'm changing the name to Seclock to his company. Hold on a sec. So let me now... So now the two names... okay so that's the one that explains the whole thing I really appreciate it thank you yeah no problem anything else you've been having trouble with nope that's it thank you all right have a great rest of your day reach out if you need anything else okay thank you bye...
