## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Maureen Cunningham, and I work for Human Capital Pursuit. And we are, I'm just getting my central phone set up and everything. And I also need the PCR capture. I have it on my LinkedIn, but not on my resume. I can't seem to get the resumes to upload. and I also use the... So the PCR capture is only for like when you're on like LinkedIn or Zoom info. It doesn't do resumes. Oh, because it used to. I used to just click on a resume and it would populate into PCR for me. Yeah, not with capture. Did you maybe have the Outlook portal add in? Well, that's what I need to help with. I need the PCR for Outlook. Maybe that's why it's not working. Yeah, that's a different tool than Capture. Capture is just like when you go to LinkedIn and you get that thing that pops up at the right. So there are different channels. Do you have the RingCentral app already? Yeah, we don't. Yeah, I'm new to it, though. So I'm connected right now through RingCentral. Okay, so you've downloaded their app already? Yes. Okay. Okay, so if you can go to video and then select join. It's easier for me to do it through RingCentral if you have it in case I need to take over screen control. Okay. Okay, so let me know when you... Schedule video meeting Gmail or Outlook? No, you're going to go over to join. I did join meeting. Okay, and it's going to ask you for a meeting ID? Yes. Okay, meeting ID is 050-394-810. Okay, and click join. Yeah. Okay, so what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of your meeting screen, if you can click share, but go over to entire screen. And then you'll have to select which screen to share. Okay. Join audio by computers coming up. on that or um I'm sorry what is it so you want to share it I've got a screen and then I'll show you like a preview especially if you have more than one monitor you have to click on well right now I've got a I've got a box that says choose how to join audio oh continue without audio since we're on the phone okay gotcha okay sorry so message me I got a little distracted there for a moment. So now I'm looking and it shows my screen and you and what am I supposed to click on? So if you go to share down at the bottom, go to entire screen. Choose which screen. Okay. Yeah. Make sure you select entire screen. And then especially if you have more than one monitor, which one you want to show me? Okay. So click on which one you want to show me. So would that be the one with PCR on it? No, probably whatever is going to be like your main Windows screen probably. Okay, okay, the laptop screen. Okay, screen one and then share. Okay, flipping over now. All right, so here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to ask for remote control because you might also need Java, launch or there's a few things that you might need. Yeah, I know I downloaded a couple of things, but Alyssa said, just call Main Sequence. Yeah, now as far as setting up RingCentral, there's going to be some things that they will need to do for you, like putting in your account. We're not really supposed to be touching any settings for any users. I think I'm all set with the RingCentral. I think it's really, I just need the PCR for Outlook. Okay. Yeah. What's going on here? Is this, there it goes. Okay, so let's see. You have Amazon Coreto. Okay. You either want that or. Alyssa did a bunch of stuff for me. Okay. Yeah, you either want that or Java. Okay, so you got that. That's good. Because even if you were to, oh, wait a minute. Okay. I just thought, hold on one second. Okay. Okay, launcher is there. Okay, so that's good. Portal, you should have it then. Let's see. Okay. Now, one thing you have to be using is the classic Outlook. Yeah, she told me I can't have new. Yeah, they don't support the com add-ins. Okay. And that's, unfortunately, like, if there is an option, would it basically have to be completely rewritten, which is a huge underkicking. I don't know. Yeah. I was looking it up. I was looking it up. It's like, yeah, it would be like a whole new program rewrite if it would even be supported. Okay. Outlook Classic. This is the one that we want. So we want the one. Okay. So that's their new. Okay. I have both. Yeah, you'd want to use this. I always forget which one's which this way. Yeah, I used email. I flipped off. I flipped the off switch for the new. Okay. Yeah, you still have it installed. So you just got to make sure like down here you're going into this one. So there's probably something in the setup here. I wonder if she had to run it as an administrator or it could be disabled. Okay, so let's see what's going on here. if you run it as an administrator you gotta kind of manually edit in that parts done that's good add-ins probably here under disabled for some reason that's exactly what happened okay go I should flip it to disabled first Sometimes when you have a bunch of add-ins, they might get slow to load and Outlook just I always think of Swayze and Disab...
