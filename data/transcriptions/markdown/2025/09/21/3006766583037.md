## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is Mary. Hi, Mary. It's Robin Montoni with Main Sequence, PC Recruiter. Hi, Robin. How are you? Yeah, thanks for getting back to me. Yeah, can you check on the status of my credit card and if it's showing an expiration date? It only shows me, so I only can see the last four digits. Is that the one starting with 3-3 something? Wait, wait. Oh, shoot, I just had this up. Hold on one second. Let me pull it back up. I literally just hit up next and I closed it. It's $33.27. That's the only thing it lets me see. All right. So I'm concerned. Apparently Visa has a system that if people see that, you know, the same vendor's been using the same card and the only difference is that the month is, you know, lapsed after, you know, five-year period, right, that a lot of times Visa will inform the vendor without going through me. But then sometimes I notice that certain vendors aren't getting that alert. So should we redo or what should we do to make sure that next, because my card is supposedly same number, but different expiration at the end of June, hence my call. So it is probably better for me to walk you through like where you would maintain it from what I'm experiencing. I'm going to send you an invite right now. Okay. All right. Okay. Let me get on my clip. Let me get on this. I'm analog. I still do the phone thing. So I didn't have my computer up, but I will get it up real fast. Bear with me. Mary at biotech.com, right? Yes. Okay. Hang on. I'm not sure if I even know off hand what my... Bear with me. Just coming in from outside. It is so sunny out that my eyes are adjusting. Bear with me. several days of that it was pretty darn nice here in Cleveland to experience that now it's raining again of course good did you so for the 4th of July did you have any happening oh it was gorgeous all weekend okay beautiful 90 almost like too hot it's like 90 yeah great okay let's see here with me. We found this one fabulous winery and it was so hot but it was wonderful. Great band playing, beautiful place, great food. Every weekend should be a long weekend I think. I know I really enjoyed it. So let's see let me see main PCR let's see if I can um hang on so what i sent you so this new billing system that we have it has this customer billing portal and which is really nice so that way like when your card expires if you just want to use a different one you could go in any time and change it um it just seems like it wants you to change it rather than me. So what I did is I sent you an invite to it. The email will come from billing at main sequence dot net. Let me know when you get that email because I have to walk you through some steps. Okay. All right. I am looking at the email. Should I hit the so what you'll need to do yeah there's a link in there or actually you have to click sign up when you click the link you'll have to click sign up or is it sign up or create an account I forgot how it's called okay and then when you create the account you'll have to do it as Mary at biotech or calm because that's the email that we have for your billing all right all right and then I need to make up a password that's different than what I'm using on the other. It could be, it could be whatever you want. It's just this is completely separate because it's, it's completely separate. Okay, yeah, so it could be whatever you want. You could make it be the same if it's easier for you. All right, that's up to you but all right hang on let me go let me come up with Let me try this. So I'm going to come up with a new password. Yeah, whatever you wanted to do. It may not fit for you because it's got some restrictions on what it can be. All right. And then let's see. Hold on. All right. It's weird that it doesn't let you see what you just typed. Hopefully, you know, it doesn't give you the option to see what you've just done. So hopefully I typed it the way I thought I typed it. I think if you have, like, Google, I think it'll ask you, it'll prompt you, do you want to say what they believe? Yes, yes, and it's secure to log in. All right. Now what it usually does is it sends you an email just to make sure it's you. Okay an email will be sent. Okay let's do it. There it is and we're going to watch this is some code confirm email just by click here to get the email and let's see. Okay, I'm in a thing that says invoices history profile vault. Okay, so what you're going to want to do is go to the vault area. That's where you can manage your payment method. Okay, all right, and let's see if it lets me just do my, it doesn't let me interestingly it doesn't ask me for the expiration it only asks me for the so I'm same thing as you it shows let me see I go on it's not a new card it does ask for my you know, my CV number, which, by the way, hold on, I have to run to the other room. That's my first thing. Okay. Okay. It shows the same last number, and it wants, it's odd that it doesn't ask about expiration. Is there an edit option? No, it's not. It goe...
