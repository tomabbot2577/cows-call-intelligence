## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hey, this is Rebecca. I am looking to actually add a seat in PCR. I just wanted to see what the process was to do that. Like a new user? Yes. Or are you thinking about maybe the, what's it called, the portal licensing tool? I'm adding somebody to my team, and so I need to have a seat for her. oh okay so you want to actually add like a user to your account i see um that's kind of like a sales question i think um let me see um you mind holding for a sec i think i want to ping my salesman and be like and ask him because i'm kind of new to that question i've never heard that question before sorry sure uh one second Rebecca, let me figure this out. Hello, are you there? I'm here. I think he's at lunch, unfortunately. It went straight to voicemail. So adding a user, you know what? Let me ask my boss. I'm going to just try this one more time. Sorry, Rebecca. Sure. Give me one second. Thank you. All right. No one is answering their phone. Do you know how to create a username, Rebecca? I don't know. Okay. Well, here, we can do this. If you want to create a new username, I can help you through that for your new employee. And then we can deal with the billing aspect maybe, like, later through the ticketing system. I can make a ticket say, like, hey, Rebecca called in. We created a new user. She wants to add one more user to her account. And I'll put the billing and sales department on it, and they'll reach out to you through that. Does that sound like a reasonable plan? Yes, that sounds good. Okay, great. So are you an admin user of PC Recruiter? I am. Cool, cool. You've never created a username before for anyone? I have, but it's been, I mean, a couple years. Okay. All right, one second, Rebecca. Rebecca, let me find you and log in as like your user or whatever so I can see exactly what you see. What company are you with? Expanded Talent Solutions. Expanded Talent Solutions. Give me one second. Let me find you. Expanded Talent Solutions. There you go. Rebecca Thompson. Is that what I saw? It was very fast. It's Rebecca Thornton. Thornton. Sorry. My eyes just went to the most common TH name. It flashed on my screen and then went away. All right, so I'm logging in. What's the username you log in as? Hang on. Let me see if I can log in. I'll get back in. It might not matter. I think admin works for me. I logged in as the admin user. So I'm just going to walk you through adding a user. Okay, so I just need to log into the admin portal? No, you can log in as Rebecca. It looks like your username can do this. It has permission to create users. Okay. Well, I mean, it is an admin, so I guess let's just continue with this. Sure. All right. So inside PCR, you're going to want to click System at the top, the main toolbar option. Uh-huh. And then under that, there's Users on the left. And then when you click Users, Manage Users will appear in, like, the middle area of the top frame. Mm-hmm. From there, there's an action called add user on the top right in the action menu, or perhaps left when you've moved it over. And then a window will open. So here, you're going to want to fill out all this stuff. Not all of it. Not all relevant, but we can go through it. So the full name will be like the person. That's not the username. Give it a name. If you want to give their email address in there as well, that would be helpful for a couple of the features of the software. But under security information, you'll see username, password, and verify password. Those are like the three most important ones, I'd say. You can create the user, give it a password, verify the password, and then don't hit save quite yet. When you've gotten that far, let me know. Okay. Okay, so the left-hand side, there's like different tabs. Could you click on security? Uh-huh. And then there is kind of like your decision here now on like how much access to the software you want this new person to have. I don't want them to have full administrator access. but I want them to be able to add in stuff, just add in records to the database. We don't do a ton of work in PCR, so just enough so that she can maybe import a list into PCR, do a sequence if she wants, but I don't think she needs full admin. Let me explain a bit about how these permissions work. System administrator, do you see that at the very top? Yes. It says no permission. Don't let that like daunt you or anything that can stay at no permission. That's, that's basically a setting that if you set that to full permission, it will override all the other settings. If you say, if you set that to full permission, basically all the other settings don't matter because you've given them full system admin permission. So you can leave that at no permission. but you want them to be able to add in records. Those would be like all the individual permissions underneath it. Okay. You know what, here. I still want to delete anything. And you k...
