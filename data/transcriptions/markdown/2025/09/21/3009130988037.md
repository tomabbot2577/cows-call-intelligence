## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hey, so yeah, we have somebody on the line here. Awesome. Yeah. Oscar, are you there? Yes, I am. Excellent. Not at the beach, but I am here. All right. Yeah. So, and Garrett, you're still there? yes cool I just want to make sure I parked that call and I've never done that before and I just kind of made up how to get it back because I didn't know how to get it back but there it was so it worked um yeah so I wanted to um kind of introduce Oscar you to Garrett he's going to be your trainer here PC recruiter so um he's going to be the one that's going to get you up and running on the system generally we'll do a couple to three sessions before your dimensional search training. So we will kind of go through and get those scheduled at the end of the call today. I'm going to, we are going to run through a quick question, a quick couple of questions for you about how you want to use the system, some of the add-ons you want to set up since your dimensional search. We already know some of them this time, so we know some of the basics there. But I'm going to be a person, if you ever need to add a user, drop a user, or if there's anything and you don't know who to talk to, reach out to me, and I can either help you or get you to someone who can. Garrett's going to be the one to get you up and running and trained on the system. He's going to work hand-in-hand with the team over at Dimensional Search to get you trained on here. So I will turn it over to Garrett to go through the questions and get the first couple of trainings on the schedule. So I'll go ahead and turn that over to Garrett. Nice to meet you. So yeah, I'll be your trainer, like Jim mentioned, and the way it works with Dimensional Search is I'll take a the trainings where I'm showing you how to use the software. And then I'll pass you over to dimensional search for some more of the, you know, philosophy behind recruiting. And then they'll pass you back to me. So we'll just bounce back and forth during this full training process. So let's start here with some of these questions. What industry will you be recruiting in? So the industry is human resources software. Perfect. Okay. And then have you used any recruiting software before PCR or even like an Excel spreadsheet or something like that to track things? No, it isn't. Okay. Got it. And then are you going to have any other admin users on your PCR database or maybe bring them down the line, some more admin users? Right now it's just an army of people. Got it. All right. And then what operating system do you use, a Windows or a Mac? Windows. Perfect. And then your preferred browser, are you using Chrome or Edge? Meter.gov. Okay, so for PCR, you'll have to use either Chrome or Edge for PCR to function, as well as our PCR capture tool, which is kind of a browser extension that allows you to grab people from places like LinkedIn, ZoomInfo, and then bring them into the database. So I would recommend either installing Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge for use with PCR. And then let's see, who is your email provider? Is it like a Microsoft Office or Gmail? Yeah, so I use Microsoft Edge. Oh, perfect. Along with my . Gotcha. Okay, so Microsoft Edge, I'll make a note there. And then you can say you use Outlook as your provider for email, Microsoft. And then so Dimensional Search does usually recommend or set you up with HireEasy as a third-party tool, ZoomInfo, and then even RingCentral as a phone system. Are there any other ones that you've heard of or plan to use for your recruiting? So I heard of nven.ai, the company. It's similar to Zoom Info. Without the Zoom Info, this kind of rate is much cheaper. I received a memo yesterday and I haven't received one yet from Zoom Info, but I am scheduled to get a call with them shortly. Okay, cool. But I do think that in the future I might go with either placing one more together or just adding Inven to my repository. Okay, cool. And what was that AI one you said? Can you spell that? Inven, I-N-V-E-N, Inven, like inventory. Oh, okay. .ai. Awesome. All right. And then let's see, do you have a website that you plan on using where you can post jobs for people to apply to? Yes. So it's being built, but the domain is a company name, Trustform.ai. Perfect. Okay. So we will cover that in our training. It's called the Job Board feature, where you basically create positions in your database, and then they'll show up on your website through the Job Board so people can apply. Awesome. I'll just mark down that the website might not be fully ready yet, but that's quite all right. Okay, I think that's all the questions I have. Let's schedule the first two trainings now, and then after that I'll pass you over to dimensional search. Let me pull up my calendar here. What time zone are you in? We're on Eastern. Correct, Eastern. Okay, good. That'll be easy then. All right. All right. So I have a lot of openings starting next week, the 14th. Is there a day that you prefer? All right. So I...
