## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Teresa with WorldBridge Partners in Omaha, Nebraska. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Thanks. I have, so we recently earlier this year installed Zoom Phone, and I have an employee that's starting on Monday that is going to be using a different database. And when I'm in that database, I try to launch the phone and it says it's not there. So I don't know if there's something you guys need to do. Not sure. Okay. Let's see. I'll go to your databases here. All right, so which database is having the trouble? Omaha, Maine. Omaha, Maine. All right, we'll just log in there. And what's your username for that database? Oh, golly, wolly. TLH. TLH. Awesome. Okay, that works. And I'm going to double check if there's anything that needs turned on on our end for the Zoom phone. I have some internal documents on the setup for that. One second. Okay, I do need to activate it for the database. I see. Okay. So Omaha, Maine. Got it. Okay. It has, yeah, it has been activated for your database now, the use of Zoom with Omaha, Maine. Okay. So the setup should flow normally now. Were there any other databases that you wanted me to turn that on for? If you want to check, I'm pretty sure we did this, but if you want to check WBP Legal, I'm pretty sure it's already set up, but let's just double check it. Yeah, I'll double check. Okay, let's see. WBP Legal. Okay, there it is. That one's in good shape. Okay. Yeah, it's turned on for both of those. Excellent. Okay. And then, excuse me, I installed, I was in his... on his computer and I installed the PCR Outlook thingy. Okay. And it's not, it's still not connecting. Any idea what I might have missed? Okay. So when you open Outlook, is it showing the PCR tab in the main menu of Outlook next to like file or home or? No, no. Okay, so that's not even connected in, I see. Is this user, do they have Outlook Classic installed on their computer rather than Outlook New? Yes, we have Outlook Classic. Good, okay. I'm going to walk back to his computer, so bear with me. I don't know if I don't shit and lose you, but sometimes my headset doesn't have the best range on it. So let's just see here. Are you still there? Yeah. Can you still hear me? Hello? Yep. Okay. Hello? Okay, cool. Yeah. Okay. Let me get logged in here. Email. Okay, so the Outlook is not there. I already installed the launcher. Oh, but I got to check. I'm pretty sure I did this the other day, but let me just double-check. The optimize for compatibility, right? Right, okay, that's good. Do you have Java installed on the computer as well? Oh, yes. I think the latest version of Java would help. Okay, that's good. Hang on. It says there's an update available. Oh, okay. Should I go ahead and update it? Yeah, maybe updating would help. Was there anything else in the Outlook? Java did not install. Oh, okay. I may have to go delete it. Let me go in. Oh, you know what? and then reinstall it. Go ahead. Yeah, I usually go to add, remove, like you're saying, add, remove programs, get rid of anything Java, and then do a fresh install from java.com whenever that happens. Okay. Oops. Java. Uninstall. Uninstall. Uninstall. Oops. Java.com. Yeah, just go to Java.com, and towards the bottom should be a button that says Download Java for Desktops. Okay, yeah. And then probably that same button will appear on page two, and then it'll start the download. and yeah when the download completes open the file and hopefully the installation works this time around now that you cleared out the older version Okay, worked that time. Good. All right, so yeah, if you do have Outlook open currently, I would close it out completely and then relaunch Outlook. Before or after I launch CR? I don't think it would matter either way. You could just, yeah, just close out of Outlook and then reopen it. Okay. It's still not there. Okay. And are you getting prompted for a serial number at all? No. Okay. So we do have a trick to manually install it since the automatic installation didn't work. Let me get my instructions on that. All right. So if you go to File in the main menu of Outlook. Okay. And then go to Options at the bottom left. Okay. And then go to add-ins on the left. Okay. And then go towards the bottom in the center. There's a button that says go. Oh, yeah. Yep. And currently, does it list PCR underscore Outlook in that list of add-ins? No, it does not. Okay. That's fine. Go to, there's an add button on the right. Yep. And then navigate your C drive. So if it says like this computer on the left listed there. Yep. Look for the C drive. Yep. Program files. Okay, so in the C drive, we're looking at RAM files 86 or x86. Okay, and then there should be a folder called main sequence technologies. Yep. And then PCR portal as well. Okay. Or Outlook portal, maybe it's called a different folder. Is that listed in there? I'm sorry, say that again. PCR. Sorry, got it c...
