## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. How are you doing? I've got a quick question for you. I've got a – when I have candidates pull up to the cell phone and work phone, they don't put any dashes in there. It's just all one number. How do I put a dash in there? Every time I put a dash, it never saves it as a dash. So I think the format's different. Yeah, let me pop it into your database and take a look here. Do you have an example of one that I could take a look at? Sure. I've got one right now, yeah. Gary Suarez. I just put him in there. Let me see what your international settings are set to. Oh, it's because your phone number is set to international formatting. Okay, how do we change that? So if you go to system Okay And then in that little search bar that comes up If you just start typing international And you'll see international settings Yep Okay And then you'll see phone formatting Phone formatting Yeah, it says international format where do I change that to? So if you wanted to just be like US and Canada? Yep. And then just hit save when you're done. I did, I did. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, it works better. All right, I appreciate it, man. That's all I needed. Yep, no problem. You have a great day. Thank you. You too, babe. Bye....
