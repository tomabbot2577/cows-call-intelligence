 Jim how are you I'm well Nabil how are you I am very well thank you believe that you saw my my email I did I got that there so you're looking to see if we could kind of get everything delayed till January which shouldn't be a problem I'm just waiting on final confirmation because I think they did the year was covering September through September it was due to be invoiced in September I'm gonna make sure they can delay that shouldn't be a problem no but I'll work yeah if you want to do the revising voice I can do and everyone anything for my sign a new contract i can do that the problem is only probably i can tell you that i applied in uh in july um and then i'm just waiting because and then i sent him a bunch of emails saying that can you do you have any updates or something and this is not about us consulate any constant investing they never get back to you until they they have some you know they they go through their own time it doesn't matter what you signed a contract you sign anything it's not only one contract. I have offices. I have a lot of different things that I need to delay or something because there is no way like it's just two weeks left and they haven't done the interview yet. I don't know what's going to happen, when they're going to. Maybe they will schedule in September. And then after that, I have a full apartment here. So there is no way I will be able to move in like three weeks or month time. There is no way. It's going to go wasted. That's the only thing. Maybe if things go smoothly, let's say in the next two or three weeks, let's say they've done it. Maybe I can see myself being there in November or December. And then I will ask you if you can think to do it early. If not, then it's okay. But for the safe side, I'm adding the time and everything, keeping it in January, because that will be the better way to do it. That's what I think. But if anything, I get an update as soon as I hear, I will let you know about that for sure. Perfect. And I'll let you know just to make sure we can do it. I think we can. I just need to talk with Robin so we can put everything on hold. Yeah, yeah. Just let them know about my situation. and if they wanted to approve on that, I can definitely send you those emails and I'll keep sending it to the investing counsel. But just for sure, if you mean the record is a genuine issue, I will not be using it, right? So what I'm going to do with this, like until I get the visa done and then I physically move there, I will not be using it at all. So that's the only thing, you know. Okay. Yeah, should be no problem at all, but I'll confirm it. Let me know once you know more or if anything's going on. Yeah, I will 100%. I'll definitely give you a portion on those things, okay? Fantastic. All right. We'll talk to you soon. All right, Jim. All right. Thanks a lot. Take care. Have a good day. Cheers. Bye. You too. Bye....
