## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hey, Jim. Hello. How are you, Tiffany? How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm pretty well. Pretty well. Thanks for joining me this morning. Is it just you joining today? It's just me today. All right. All right. So I guess what we're going to take a look at today is the premium features, notably the sequencing, kind of some of the newer stuff that you don't have with PC Recruiter. Is that correct? Yeah. So I have a marketing person now, and I wanted to have her look into PCR and dig into it to get some emails going where we can send those out to people. And so when we called, it turned out I don't have the premium, I guess, to be able to do that. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I guess sequencing is part of that or something. And so that's where I'm just I'm not sure. Okay. Yeah. So we do have – you have – right now, you have the Enterprise Package. And in the Enterprise Package, you do have the ability to send bulk emails. But they're just that. It's an older technology to send bulk emails. But the newer version that will allow you to send bulk emails, email campaigns actually, not only allows you to pull like reports so you can see when you sent the campaign, you can see who opened, who replied, how many times they opened it, what they clicked. With that, you're going to be able to see the information, but then moreover, you're also going to be able to set up sequences so that you are able to say, send an email to everyone on this list, and then if they open it, add them to my call list. But if they don't acknowledge it in three days or five days, send them this second email, and then maybe if they don't acknowledge that, take them off the list, or maybe if they do, add them to my call list, maybe send them a text through RingCentral or something like that. So you do have a lot of automation that you could set up if you wanted to within within PC Recruiter. OK, so that where I pay. Go ahead. So I was going to say, let me show you around a little bit. You currently don't have that package. So you have the enterprise package of PC Recruiter. So it looks like I'm going to pull up your actual paperwork here to see what's going on there. So we have the ability to send bulk emails. It just doesn't track anything or give you any information. You just hit send and it goes out to cyberspace and you never know anything about it. Yeah. Yeah. You just kind of send it home. You don't see if they open it or see how many times or anything like that. So does this work even with like, So if we send it to a client list, I mean, it's the same whether whoever we're sending it to, if they opened it, and when you said, are you saying they respond, are you just saying that we sent something that would ask a question or whatever? Yeah, so what you can do, you can see. So let me show you, actually. Let me share my screen here. Okay, great. So I'll kind of just play it. And one question real fast. When we get this option, do I pay per person, or is it something I pay for that is just part of then the package that I pay for with PCR? It's per person. Upgrade the package, but you have to upgrade everyone. You can't keep other people out of it, so it would kind of – it includes several things, but it would be an upgrade for the whole package. It would be $20 more per user per month and a one-time 500 setup. The 500 setup includes turning on all the new features and six hours training. okay okay so to kind of show you around a bit so if you're sending a bulk email let me see i've got a girl that i may want to add to this call one second if you don't mind not at all let me see if i can get a hold of her real fast because she you know if i needed to add her as a user, I could, and then she could probably, you know, okay, give me one second. I'm sorry. Sure, no problem. I don't have her phone on my phone for some reason. Okay, one second. Hey, are you available by chance right now for 30 minutes? Okay. Can I add you into a Zoom? I'll send you the invite or hat, Jim, but I'm on the phone with PCR, and he was going to kind of show me their sequencing with PCR, where like if we send out an email and then someone replies or opens it, it shows us and then we can create some kind of campaign. And so, okay, all right, I'll have him send you the invite. Thank you, bye. Okay, can you send this to your invite you sent me or I guess I can just forward it, right? So, yeah, you could just forward it. It'll come through, and you can just click the button and join right in. Yeah, let me just do that real fast. Thanks. For sure. I'll just send her the invite. her name's Christine and she's kind of been doing her marketing and she'll understand a lot more of this than you know I mean I will understand it but you know what I mean sure sure yeah Thank you. Give her some new ideas and everything. Yeah. Okay, she should be here in a second. Thank you. T...
