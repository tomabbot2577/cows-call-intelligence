## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainState. This is Robin. Oh, hey, Robin. This is Jason Gibson. I just had a question for you regarding my signature. I can't change the signature in Outlook. I can change it in Outlook, but the way the image works, it's all like always wonky. Okay. Let me see. Let me see what. sunset transportation remember it right i'm sorry what's your company sunset yes yeah let me see what you got uh what database are you at bgc or sunset uh sunset okay what username let me take a look at what you have right now and Jay Gibson, but I would also need to change D La Rocha as well. D La Rocha, I think it's, I think it's, I just said typo. Hold on one second. Okay, so let's see what you have in there right now. System. so are you trying to use an image as your signature um not as my signature but see the little here i'm gonna i'm gonna do this this will probably help so i just crack i just see when i try to edit the signature i can't i can't take what i have from my Outlook and just paste in there. I don't know what someone played with it before. Is it an image that you have in there? Or like what, because what happens with Outlook, Outlook has its own source code. So let's do a screen share. You want me to share? Okay. Yeah. Do you have RingCentral or? Yeah. You do? Okay. Let's do RingCentral. When people have RingCentral, I like doing it through there because then I can take over mouse control maybe. Okay, so let's see. Let me start up a meeting for you. Okay, so if you go into your RingCentral app, go to video and select join. So download for Gmail or download for Outlook? no you have the ring central app right yeah okay so in your like you're on windows right if you type in the word ring yeah just open your ring central app then you'll see video at the top left join at the right and then let me know when you're ready for the meeting id um okay i'm ready for the meeting id okay zero five zero three nine four 810. Okay. Join. All right. Now, when you join, you don't need audio because, or at least. Continue without audio. Yeah, continue without audio. Perfect. So, it's around the phone. Let's get some, like, background stuff. Okay. So, let's have you do this. At the bottom of your meeting screen, click share. Mm-hmm. and you're going to want to make sure that under entire screen you pick which monitor to show and then click share I assume everybody's multiple monitors anymore okay all right show me what's in your outlook signature that you want to copy yes okay all right here's what I would recommend right click on that image. Does it give you a right click? Yeah we want to save picture because the problem is probably with a picture right? Your guess was good. Okay give it a simple name because sometimes when you copy paste or upload sometimes it I'm going to see what happens but let's go ahead and just save it as a PNG okay okay and then hit save okay let's take what you have here like if you go into that signature area do like a control a let's see what happens there because we'll probably just have to look at the source code. So if you do control A it should select everything in that box. Yeah it didn't. Let me try this. Control A. Nope. Okay. All right. Let's kind of drag the mouse over all the text and then copy. Try that. Going all the way down. All the way down? Yeah, because you want that image too, right? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to to see what happens if we do it this way. Right click and select copy. Okay. All right. Let's minimize or close this area. Okay. Let's go to email signature. Okay. So you got the new document at the top? Paste what you have there. Oh, shit. I just hit copy. Fuck. But I just hit control C. Oh, but you had the thing before. If you right click and hit select paste, do you have any text there? No, because I accidentally hit... Oh. Okay. Now, let's not save this in case we want to revert back but see how there's the less than and greater than up at the upper right because basically what's going on is we're trying to switch this from microsoft code okay let's see that those are paragraphs doesn't get the image though okay all right let's exit out of here. Well, there's no image there. Okay, so here's what we'll do. At the end of, don't save it, don't save it. Here, I want to show you. When I copied this signature, when you had me do this, when I went to paste it in the new box, instead of hitting control D, I actually hit control C. So let me try that again. Okay. And move this out. Okay, let's do the new. Yeah, try it now. Let's see what we got. And scroll down. Nothing. And I don't know why. Not grabbing that. Okay. So what we could do is clean up the text. But then what we could do is upload that image to what's called the server image store. That's where you had your image before. Ah. Yeah. So let's go ahead and refresh my memory here. At the end of Jason Gibson, click on there and hit enter. Okay. Now hit delete to bring that other line up. Okay. Try enter now. Oka...
