## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. I'm Connie Rose. I'm with Alexander Raymond. You have me under Connected Services. And I'm having a little trouble getting PCR capture to engage with LinkedIn. Oh, okay. I can help with that. Yeah, absolutely. I had a training session, and it worked fine on the training session. So I went to make certain it was still installed. that showed installed, but when I click, yeah, I'm in and I'm linked in all the time. And so it's a great thing for me to transfer people over, especially new connections. And I open up the full profile because it said in the directions that I listen, I actually listen to the new information on the video. And I opened up the profile of a first connection and double clicked the icon on the toolbar and it just sits there with the PCR capture video staring at that. But I don't see – let me go back here. I'm just going to pull another random person. Okay. Once you pull up a LinkedIn profile, you shouldn't have to click on the logo at the top right of the browser. You should actually halfway down the screen on the right see a click to add button appear. Is that the button that's not appearing for you, to click to add. That's the button. It's not appearing. There's no, I got the whole profile open. I go all the way to the bottom. I don't see it. When I did a training session with a person that's on my team, I saw that button pop up so I know what I'm looking for. Okay. It just shows the profile of the guy. It doesn't really show anything except, you know, the LinkedIn logo and a bell. Gotcha. Okay. So, if you go to the PCR capture menu, so the, at the top right of your browser click on that PCR logo that's up there. It should open the PCR capture menu. Now are you talking about the software PCR logo or the PCR capture logo? PCR capture logo. So it's kind of top right by the white puzzle piece icon. Actually it's on my toolbar but I don't have it on the... It says extensions that have a puzzle piece. Okay. Once I click on the puzzle piece. Okay. You can pin that capture tool by clicking the pin to the right of it. That'll put the logo up to the left of the puzzle piece. Just did. Excellent. So if you click on that. Hang on. Hang on just a second. Okay. I do that. Then a box opens that says capture, and then it says enter your PCR site, and it's got the site already in there with a login option. So that's what the issue is. You're not currently logged into the tool. And the website that's listed in there might just be the placeholder text that you have to type over. Does it have the words my company at the end or something like that? Yes, it does. It does. I can't even get in there to change it. I can't even change it. Yeah, that's if you put your cursor in there and start typing, it'll it'll type over it. OK, but you'll want to just go to PCR in your browser and copy that Web address from your PCR and paste it into that. OK, the the PCR that has connected services on it. Yeah. OK, copy. I would have never got through this. No worries. That's why we're here to help. Okay. Let me go in here. Let me go back. I can't remember any of my logins. That's why I have a spreadsheet. Okay. We'll keep putting the password and all this stuff. I'm hoping when I click away to the spreadsheet that I don't lose my capture window. So let me see what it tells me here to do. Okay, it gives you my name. I'm going to have to highlight this. I'm going to have to copy and paste this. Copy. Copy. It gave me a pretty crazy... It's not crazy, but it's long. Yeah, that makes sense. Is it case sensitive? Yes. The password is not the username. The username is always all caps. Okay. Let's see if I can get it. And also make sure to select your database from the drop-down when you're entering your username and password as well. Okay. You know what's interesting? This box right here popped up before, and it told me to log out. Before... Okay. What box does it show? What does it show? It's showing PCR capture. Capture, it's got Capture and Match, and then it's got all the buttons turned on for Recruiter, Recruiter Lite, Sales, LinkedIn, all that. So that is the actual Capture menu. You don't want to click on Logout. That would log you out of the tool, and that's what happens. No, but what I'm saying is when it opened before, it didn't show, it didn't give me an option to log out. So I was evidently logged in. You see what I'm talking about? I saw that before when I clicked. Yeah. Yeah. If it asks you to put in your PCR URL, that means you've been logged out. And if you're seeing these list of websites, then you are logged in. So you should be in good shape now. If you just want to click the X at the top right of this menu, you can close it and jump over to LinkedIn and try capturing somebody again. So once I get to LinkedIn, what do I do? Just look inside? I mean, I don't know what to do. I can just pull them up. If you already...
