 Hey Robin, what's up? Hey, how much, how are you? Hold on one second, I'm trying to do my input and contact footy. He asked me about how to clear cache to get PCR mail icons to work. I'm just and then her, she was here at Monaghan. Trying to keep up on my notes, my activities and stuff. I know. Thankfully having a little like AI thing at least is helpful for my meetings because I lose, jumping from thing to thing, I would lose stuff all the time. What's up? I wonder if I did that and then we kind of stopped because of all the like, let's find out. I don't think that's a Kathy change. That looks like me screwing around, my guess. Because Kathy was going to... Initially, it was there. So if you... Did you adjust... Would you have adjusted it afterwards? Is that what you're saying? I'm thinking, yeah, because I know what I've seen with Kathy, she does not do it. A credit like that is not going to automatically get applied. You'd have to kind of take a payment from... Generate the next invoice, and none of that's done. We don't keep up. Let's see. When the next invoice gets generated, though, is it going to... It doesn't automatically apply. No, it does not. You have to basically generate the invoice. Excuse me. You basically have to generate the invoice, take that credit as a payment, like that overpayment, and as a payment for the next one. But then it's kind of weird how you have to do it. And then you have to skip the next invoice, like the next recurring. it's kind of like a little clunky my opinion but whatever that's how we have to do it so i don't i'm so confused on this because i swear to god they were saying like they say one thing and then they say something else and then i think i figured it out i think that the problem is so they're not actually in the city of chicago so i think that's why they don't have to um pay for the that's why they don't have to pay to they don't pay tax I tried to I couldn't find the exact like whatever yeah it has something to do with I found whatever the description was like basically Chicago like if you're using software like if you're using software it's like online Chicago still wants their money wait bill said it was whoops yeah that one's specific to chicago but if they're the state of illinois doesn't do that it's local only so i'm thinking it's probably a particular like they don't have to we don't have to do the state tax because they're not somebody not downloading but then there's some other ones that all of a sudden are popping up in that tax menu um like who is the one shit who was it called hold on one second I need to fix this first of all because then there was one email like oh it's about a threshold and I'm like well that's kind of contradicting what you said I don't know it feels like it's not that complicated but then you'll see it is complicated I'm like, well, I just got to be able to explain, like, why. And he goes, well, then tell them to call whoever their rep is for their, you know, wherever they live. We don't make the laws. We just got to follow them. Okay. So this is WorldBridge, right? So I have to change this more than. WorldBridge partner is Chicago. That's not it. I hate, she wanted to say World Bridge. I'm like, oh, there's like so many different World Bridge here. This is just World Bridge Partners Inc. Yeah, they're just World Bridge Partners Inc. Yeah. I know. They were something else before, and she was like, I don't want to say this. I'm like, all right. And then I'm like, all right. Yeah, I think they were World Bridge Partners-Chicago or something like that. Or SC Chicago Downtown. Yeah, Downtown might have been, yeah, that sounds right. Okay, so this invoice. So now, like, there's not just the Chicago one, which is kind of what was leading to all those other issues. There's like Morton, Illinois, O'Fallon, Illinois, Park Ridge, Illinois, South Elgin, Sycamore. So what are they called? Oakbrook? Oakbrook. I don't see that as an option. so then they don't that's why they don't pay taxes so then for the next invoice because they're on auto recurring okay so let me go into the recurring here I am going to put in this note area not in Chicago they are in Obrook It's not an out-of-state tax. So I'm just going to put this note in there. Okay. So what I have to do, bear with me. I'm so sorry about this. I've got to think here. See, somebody checked the box. They were saying tax, Chicago tax. No. No. I'm just going to take that out. I'll just say automatic calculation, do that. Okay, so now I've got to figure out, bear with me one second. I'm going to go to, and might as well make sure this is fixed. They are 15 users, right? Yes. Okay. just in case because if they have been going in, as we know, some are kind of screwed up. I'm still waiting for – I've called today, and I've emailed her a couple times. I got two refunds I need issued, and I don't know why she's ignoring me. That's so helpful. I'm sure – I mean, she's super busy, but I rea...
