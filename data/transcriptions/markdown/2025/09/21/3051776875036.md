## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yeah. Hey, Robin. Dave Snowberger. Is this a bad time? No, it's fine. What's up? I was having some trouble with Capture and I uninstalled it, reinstalled it, and it pops up to add somebody on LinkedIn, but it doesn't deploy. You know, I can't, it doesn't go to the add-in. screen. Could be something missing on the profile possibly. A couple things that could be. Do you have any of RingCentral? I don't use it. Okay. I'll have to offer that kind of screen share. If not, we'll just do a Google Meet. Let me see what's going on there with your capture. New meeting. Okay. Bear with me one second. I'll send you a link to join here. Okay. And it's Dave at todaysactuary.com, right? Correct. Okay. Okay. Okay, should have an email from any moment. Okay. Which link do you want me to... I should say, like, just click to join or... Join call? Yeah, I think that's how they word it. I feel like they word it differently when I send it that way. links and other functionality have been disabled because it came into the junk folder okay is there a prompt at the top to say not junk when do i came as junk well even if i do that um let me see never block sender okay you blacked me in the inbox no thanks absolutely not a lot of times when i do move it over like this um it still won't work but uh we'll see no it's blocking it again okay i guess i could read off the link to you. Okay. Go to, open up a browser. Mm-hmm. Go and type in meet.google.com and then a slash. Okay. And then this one gets a little weird. R-B-C dash Y-C-I-H-P-K-T. T like in tango? The last letter, yes, is that T as in tango. Okay. The last three letters should be Paul, Kevin, tango. Okay. Allow notifications, I guess. I guess so. Yeah. Okay. Ask to join. Okay. Admit. Okay. Let's see. So what I'm going to have you do is at the bottom of the meeting screen, you're going to click share screen. It's the rectangle with the arrow in the middle. That's going to open up another window. Let me know when you're there. Let me turn off the sound because I think you're coming in on the... Oh, okay. I'll mute. Yes. Yeah. Okay. I'll open up that window. Okay. And then you're going to go over at the right where it says entire screen. Okay. And then select the screen to show, especially if you have more than one monitor. Very important. Which one? Let's see where we are with that. LinkedIn. It's this one. And then once you click on that screen, there you go. All right. So let's do this. Let's go at the very top right where it says Manage Extensions. Let me get back on that page. Okay. Yeah, I got it. Okay. Let's go to one of your other tabs. I want to keep this Meeting tab open, but I want to just go over to a different tab. Okay, there's manage extensions. Are you on a different screen? I see you. Yeah, I opened up another screen, another browser. Okay, I'm not seeing that. Can you slide that over on top of the meeting screen? You might be, that might be on another monitor maybe. There we go. Okay. So let's see what we got going on here. OK, that's good. OK, at the top right of your browser, can you click the Manage Extensions icon? I'm sorry. Yeah, click Manage Extensions. I have to go to Extensions first, right? Yeah, there we are. Actually, no. Actually, just click directly on the extension icon. It's that kind of black-looking puzzle piece. OK, let's hit the pushpin for PCR capture. Perfect. Okay. And then you kind of click off that, close that pop-up. Let's click directly on the extension for PCR capture. It's the purple green up at the very top right of your browser. There you go. Okay. You're connected as admin. Oh, you might have basic mode on. Okay. You like to get the review, I assume, right? where you see how the information pulled rather than just capturing and go okay so turn basic mode off i wish that was removed but we'd make a couple people upset i don't like the feature at all that just means like i want to just capture and go and you don't get any preview and then we want to get yeah you want to read out everything in that we add everything on there and then take it into the their profile okay go ahead so i think that could be one thing and then do you like to get their company or just have people go to the default? I like to get their company. Okay, so turn that last option off as well. Okay, and then what site are you using this on? You're on LinkedIn? Yeah. Okay, and all of those are selected. Perfect. Okay, let's go over to somebody's LinkedIn profile now. It could be one of those settings that was causing the issue. I'm just refreshing Kate McCoy while you can't see her but okay click the update that looks better yep yep there it is yes I think it was probably that basic mode being on probably that okay super yeah it was basically probably captured but you just didn't like you probably would have had a confirmation down at the bottom if your chrome extensions are on at least or chrome notifications so i...
