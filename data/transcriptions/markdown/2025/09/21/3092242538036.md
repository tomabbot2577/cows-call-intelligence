## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah. Hi, Tyler. I'd be happy to work with you, but Garrett is familiar with my problem. I didn't know if he was available. He is on the other line right now. I've been actually helping Garrett with your having the capture issue, correct? yeah so he sent me an email and I just wanted to I'm kind of when I'm trying to follow it I'm getting these kind of intimidating messages and I was hoping you could walk me through it yeah with clearing your site data yes so you know he has me going so I'm on a LinkedIn profile and I went to that toggle. And so the options I have, connection is secure, pop-up and redress, automatic download. Redress site settings. Yes. Okay, I went there. And then he told me there's a, onto the right, there's like a whole thing, delete data. Yep. So when I click that, it says, you know, you'll be signed out of this site, including open tabs. Any offline will be deleted data that affects ad personalization is deleted. Yep. And then you just hit delete there. Okay. I did. And then you'd go back to the LinkedIn page. There. And it will have you sign in again. I did. And then you'll go ahead and go to a LinkedIn profile. And then once you get to the profile... Hold on, it's making me verify. It's making me verify. Check your LinkedIn app. We sent a notification to your sign-in devices. We know that you recently tried. I'm looking for the LinkedIn app. Sorry. No, not a problem. It should give you an option to send a text message there as well. Verify using SMS. Is that the option for text? Yep. Got it. Thank you for your help. Yep, not a problem. Okay, we're there. All right. So now go ahead and go to a LinkedIn profile and then refresh the page. Damn, didn't work. because when me and Garrett have been looking at this it's something with either your we think it has to do with your browser or maybe like settings you have in your browsers because we were able to log into your account yesterday and the capture tool worked completely fine on LinkedIn so there's something going on with your specific computer that's causing this I believe you what do I I mean how do I you know what kind of settings that's what we're trying to figure out okay I appreciate that what's interesting when I go to recruiter light you know then I could you know, I can, it allows me if I go to somebody it allows me to do that. Yeah. Which doesn't make a lot of sense. Well, that leads us to believe it's something like a setting you have with that specific site. That's why we tried clearing out those site settings. Should I reboot the system? Would that help? Yeah, you can give it a try. One thing I want you to do as well, click those dots at the top and go to view site settings. What I did before, you mean? Yep. Go to site settings. Yep. And then under delete data, you'll see it says reset permissions. Yes. Click on that. Hit that. Yep. The next time you visit LinkedIn, that will use default permissions. Yep, then use reset. And then go ahead and exit out of your LinkedIn tab. Okay. And then open up a new tab and go to LinkedIn. And then once you're on the new LinkedIn tab, go ahead and go to a profile. All right. I'm at a profile. Is it popping up on the side for you? No. Now, Garrett had mentioned that it worked for you part of the day yesterday. In the morning. How old is your computer? I'll tell you I have the receipt. It's a few years old. Now, when you're logged in on Chrome, are you logged in with your work email or a personal email? For LinkedIn, it's my work email. not LinkedIn for like the whole profile like your whole Chrome profile I think it uses my Gmail account my personal Gmail account if I'm answering your question yeah Just trying to think of what else. be causing it here Did you have time to hop on a quick screen share? Absolutely. I look, I appreciate your help. Trust me. Yeah, I think there's a few settings I want to check here. Ringcentral.com? Yeah, I'll just email you a link here. Oh, okay. well let me have appreciative of your help I absolutely have time it's not a problem right taken care of yeah I just emailed that link on over to you get here in just a second I got it just came now perfect do you want me to join no you don't continue without audio Yeah, I see you. All right. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of that meeting window. It says share. Share. Yep. And you'll want to share your screen. You got it. It's like you've done this a time or two. Yeah. All right. I think we're sharing now. Yep. So go ahead and click over the top right-hand corner of your browser. There's that little profile picture of you. Here? Nope, very top right corner. Oh, got it, here. Yep, go ahead and click that. And then go to manage your Google account. I don't know. Maybe I did something inadvertently because I hadn't had this problem. Go to where it says personal info over on the left. And then is that the top Gmail account?...
