 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. you you you you you Good morning. Good morning. Shereen, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I am well. I see Kirk just joined as well. Yep. Okay. Okay. Hello Kirk, how are you? Mm-hmm. How are you? Pretty well. Pretty well. Okay, so we have both of you online here. Wanted to kind of open up a dialogue here and start off with what you're looking for, what you're using now, and kind of what problems you're looking to solve, perhaps with PC Recruiter. um well we're looking at a lot of different stuff right now we've used them we actually have our own proprietary system that we're using with the company i'm with uh but i'm looking at going uh on my own and with me and shireen are starting our own business so you know we need a couple of different things i don't know i'm interested in learning about you know i know PC Recruiter has been around a while. I don't know what you integrate with. I don't know if you integrate with LinkedIn, if you integrate with any other kind of systems. Jim, would you call PC Recruiter a CRM or an ATS? Both, certainly both. PC Recruiter has always been both, and we actually now have a new CRM product that comes with PC Recruiter. So you're going to have a whole sales pipeline and everything there. Okay. What kind of integrations do you do? Do you integrate with anything like Apollo, Lusha, LinkedIn, any of those type of companies? Well, we integrate with LinkedIn. We actually have a capture app, which is going to allow you to pull people and records in from LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, Resume Library, Career Builder, Zoom Info, a few others. So that is going to give you the ability to pull people into the system, populate your database. We don't have any direct integration with Lusha or any of those others. but with our open API that might be something you could write or we integrate with Zapier so you might be able to integrate PC Recruiter and anything through Zapier so that's another option there we also can allow if you wanted to post jobs to indeed, Zip Recruiter we post jobs to feed them to LinkedIn as well you could even post jobs to your own website and have candidates applying online or merely submitting their information to be considered so they don't even need to be applying to a proper job they can just submit their information in general. Okay. So let's say that someone sends in a resume to me. Does the system automatically upload and populate that, or is it something I need to do manually? Well, it's almost kind of in between. So if somebody emails a resume to you, it comes in, let's say, to your Outlook. You can right-click on that attachment and say, parse it right into PC Recruiter. Or we have a Resume Inhaler, which is a bulk parsing tool, which you can have that you, at the end of each day, just point it to your inbox and say, inhale every one of those resumes. It'll bring each one in, create a record for each one, index each resume for searching as well. And then also, you could have people uploading their resume through your website, put themselves directly into the database. So the only piece we don't do is we don't have an email address that you can just email it and it just turns up in your database. So we don't have that, but candidates can put it in online, or you can right-click or parse it into the system. You can even drag and drop it into our parsing utility. So a few different ways you can parse records in. Okay. Why don't you kind of show us some stuff here, kind of give us a walkthrough on how things work and what we can do. For sure. Have you seen PC Recruiter? Have you used it in the past at all? I've seen it a few times, but I don't know a whole lot about it. Okay, perfect, perfect. So I'll show you a couple of different options here. Like I said, the PC Recruiter, I'm going to start with the classic PC Recruiter. It's been around for 10 plus years. That is tried and true. Let me share my screen here. I'm going to go ahead and log in and kind of give you a general, just kind of few highlights of this version here. So, looking at this system, all cloud-based, it's going to be something you can connect to on a PC or a Mac. There's a mobile app. Username and password gets you in. And this is going to give you this interface. You're going to have the main menu bar at the top. That's going to be kind of some of the main access to the main elements of the system. So you're going to be able to track names, companies, positions. Those are our three main record types within the system. Names are going to be your contacts at your client companies as well as your candidates. So we're going to allow you to track both contacts, candidates. Pretty much anyone you need to track is going to be placed in a PC Recruiter under that name type. Companies are going to be companies you'r...
