## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling. I'll give this to Tyler. I want to help you. Tyler, Rob Houghton. Hey, man, I got a problem with my email, and I think I had this a couple months ago, and I can't remember what the issue was. But anyways, so I called earlier. Nobody answered. You sent me a text back, so I'm calling you back. And it's my email. So when I click on the email to hit reply, I get this little tiny box in the middle of the screen and I can't see what I'm doing sounds like you need to clear your browser cache right so how do I hold on I'm going to write this stuff right now so I don't have to keep going yeah I think that's what happened last night clear browser Yep, yeah, clear in the browser cache. Okay, how do you do that? All right. So are you on your PCR mail page right now? Yes, I am. Okay, perfect. And you're using Chrome as your browser, correct? That's correct, I'll tell you. Perfect. So in the top right hand corner of Chrome, you're going to see those three vertical dots. Yep. Got it. You're going to click on those dots and go down to where it says clear browsing data. And then once that box is open, it'll... Hold on for a second. Let me find that thing. I was writing it down. Clear. Yep. Clear browsing data. I don't see. Is it under something else like extensions or delete browsing data? Nope, it's right under extensions. It'll have that little trash can icon. Right under. Let me start over again. Click on the three dots. And then where do I go? Delete browsing data. All right, so I do go to delete browsing data. If you delete. Okay. And then once that box opens up, you'll want to make sure it's set to advanced. And the time range is set to all time. Right, yep, it is. That's the default. And then the only box that you want to have checked is the one that says Cached Images and Files. Cached Images. Yep, so that will be the only one that has a blue check. Okay, and then hit Delete Data, right? Yep. Yeah, I think this one we did the last time there. Do I have to restart it or anything or just try it? Yeah, so once it's done, go exit out of PCR mail and then log out of PC Recruiter and then log back in and reopen PCR mail. Yeah, I think this is what we did the last time. I think it's because maybe an update was done or something, right? Is that right? Not always. The whole point of the image cache is to try and help pages load quicker. Yeah. But then when you have frames inside of pages and that cache gets gummed up, it can cause things to actually not load properly because it's trying to load old images improperly. Yeah. There you go. It works now, man. Perfect. You're a game-saver, brother. Thank you. I'm more than happy to help. If you need anything else, just let us know. All right, Tyler. Thanks, man. I appreciate all you do. Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a good one. Bye. Bye....
