## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Yeah, hi, McKenzie. My name is David Hill down here in San Antonio. I'm almost 20 years with you guys. How are you doing? I'm doing fine, David. How are you? I'm doing great and I was trying to solve this problem it it's one I had a long time ago but now my wife has it and I can't remember why I think we let our server company that holds our account or something like that go a day late and it screwed up the tie-in to PCR email and so I think hers is goofed up because it's not downloading properly her her emails any longer so I was hoping you could help me with that Mackenzie maybe even share the screen with me uh sure give me a minute here let me pull up your account and get logged in as you Okay, it's under Riverwalk down here in San Antonio. Riverwalk, two words. Okay. Thank you. Hold on one moment, please. Let me catch up to that. Riverwalk. Executive search. yes and you probably can see me working I think it might have been with Matt or somebody a while ago when I had the same problem and I think it's the same problem now for her I believe but maybe not I'm just guessing I'm not a techie guy Mackenzie but you know it's something with the whatever that acronym is, STP, blah, blah, blah. It starts to connect everything, and it doesn't seem – I think that's the issue. Okay. Okay. One second. There's two databases. Are you on the MR Riverwalk or the restored version of MR Riverwalk? Or she, sorry. Well, we're both on the same one. I guess the most recent one is what it is. The restored version. The restored version, okay. I'm pretty sure. And what's the username that she logs in with? She logs in with K-H-I-L-L, Kay Hill. All right. Thank you. I'm trying to log in. What's going on here? Oh, I was just taking a second to load. All right. Okay. So when you log in, you're going to PCR mail, right? You go to the top right menu and click email, and then that opens up a new tab, and you're in PCR mail. Okay, I'm logged in as Kay Hill, and I'm looking at her connection, and it says the password's invalid. Oh, password's invalid? Well, you want me to tell you what it is, the password? You don't have to do that. Maybe, maybe, not yet, though. Okay. I mean, I've got it because I just signed in, but it populates it automatically in my Google, but I can find it in Google. so for her username i think if i think an easy fix is just her to go in and re-establish her password i don't know if she changed her password or anything like that but it's saying the password is in there well here here's what i do know i'm looking at her email right now and the last email that she got downloaded from her Outlook that it's tied in from would have been 7-3, July 3rd. So she's had this problem about a month, and she's been bugging me to help her, and I'm just now getting on it. I'm not a good husband. Okay. You just mentioned Outlook for the first time. So is this in Outlook or PCR mail or both? No, it's just in PCR mail. She gets it in Outlook, but it doesn't convert it to PCR mail. Okay. Yeah, it looks like the most recent email inside the PCR mail is December 1, 2016. That's quite a long time ago. No, her thing is all messed up too, and I don't know. we had some consultant a while back screw it up you got to go under if you can see in the left hand column of her PCR mail where it says in bold it says christy.hill at high quality leadership at the very bottom of the left hand column of the folder list I don't see a Christy in the folder list. The last thing that says Texan Hills. Are we not in the same place? Oh, you know what? Maybe that's not. Maybe you're in the wrong PCR. You should have gone to the other one, I guess. I gave you bad data on that. No Texan Hills on this one. Okay. I think I do need a screen share because I think we're in different places. Yeah. Why don't you screen share? You want to screen share? Just tell me what to do. Sure. I use Google Meet. So if you could please go to meet.google.com. Okay. And I'm going to start a new meeting here. And then for you, you'll have to enter in – there's like a – A code? It says enter in code or password. Yeah. And you go to meet.google.com. I'm going to give you 10 letters. Okay. Get my phonetic alphabet in case I need it. Okay, so, all right, we got 10 letters. Are you ready? Yep. Do they have to be alphabet? I mean, uppercase or lowercase, it doesn't matter. Just lowercase is fine. Okay. So we have U as in uniform. Okay. T. X. Okay. Okay. D as in Delta. Okay. W. Okay. C as in Charlie. Okay. Q as in Quebec. Yep. Another Q. Okay. And then W-N as in November. Okay. And then just hit join? Yeah. And then it'll ask you if you want to join. You can mute yourself in the Google Meet. We don't need to hear you twice. And then you could also hide your camera. And then at the bottom of the Google Meet, there will be a present button or share screen button. It's like a little rectangle with an up arr...
