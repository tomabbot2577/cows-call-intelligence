## 💬 Full Transcript

 I'm sorry I missed your call. Please leave a message or text me. Thank you. Hello, Art. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just following up with you. Checking in to see if you still wanted to put your PC Recruiter account on hold. I think Robinhead emails you to offer you a special deal for just $10 a month to put that on hold. But I wanted to follow up to see if that was of interest to you. And if it is, let me know. I can put a ticket in and have them get over the necessary paperwork to put that account on hold for you. My phone number is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye....
