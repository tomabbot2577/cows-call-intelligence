## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. It's Cliff Rusnak from MWorks Search. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. Doing okay. Thanks. I spoke to Garrett earlier because I've got new computers, so I'm setting everything up, and the last thing I was working on is the RingCentral. So I installed the RingCentral app. I updated Java. I updated the RingCentral launcher, and I'm trying to do a sample text out of PCR, and it's not working. Okay. So I don't know if I did something wrong. Do you have a new RingCentral account? No. So the RingCentral account is not new. It's the same one. Okay. And you have gone through their TRC or TCR process, like you can directly text out of RingCentral? Well, I don't know. See, because when this was set up years and years ago, I don't remember how I did it. All I know is it was set up and it worked. I would first try, in the meantime I'm going to look at stuff, go over to your RingCentral app. Yeah. And make sure you can send a text out of there. Oh, out of the app, not on the website. All right, let's see. Yeah. Text. Because now with business accounts or whatever, I guess you have to register. to be like a texter and yeah it's not a ccr issue oh you did all that yeah i did all that like a year or two ago um okay so let's see people go oh i didn't know i had to do that and like yeah you can't text that yeah because they were pretty like adamant about it so let's see send new text and i'm trying to i'm sending a text out of ring central but not connected to not connected to uh pcr this is a test all right let's see yeah i got it okay let me see what might be in here so and you have the ring central app that you have installed on your computer right yeah so i just sent that out of the ring Central app, which is the new one with the square logo versus the round logo, which was the old one I had in there. Well, how do you make your phone calls? Well, almost all of them I make using a hard phone. I use the soft phone when I do interviews that I transcribe using the transcription function in Ring Central. Because here's what I see. You have it set to IP phone, which means you're making calls through like that phone that they give you, I guess. The hard phone, like a desktop phone. Yes. So because of that, we cannot, so there's also what's called the RingCentral app, which would be like that all-in-one tool that you would install on your desktop. Because you're using the IP phone, you actually have to just download what's called their RingCentral phone, which was the original app. Do you know if you have that. Well, see, that's what I had. I think that's what I had on my old computer because I was on the line about a month ago at RingCentral and they were like, you don't have the right app. So I put this new app on the phone so I could do this call transcription. So now when I do an interview, I use the soft phone in this new app. I make the call and I transcribe it. But then that other app was the one every time I would text that would engage. So I'd click on the text in PCR and that would open up the old app. Yeah. So if you would, like if you go to system and then go to user. In Peace Recruiter, go to system. All right, hold on. System. Yeah, I'm in there. And you go to users and then you go to manage users. Yeah. Click on your username. Okay. And then click the gear icon next to your contact phone field and then go into the RingCentral tab. So I clicked on my name. I go on the bottom. So it, where's the gear, where's the gear located? To the right of the contact phone field once you open up your user card. All right. So I opened up contact phone and then there's a gear next to the contact phone. Yeah. So when you click that, it opens your telephone center screen. Got it. So in the ring central section at the left, what's happening is when you're making a call, right now it's passing that number over to your IP phone. Okay. Which means we don't know that you even have the newer app. So if you were passing everything, the call and the text, over to the new app, you'd be selecting RingCentral app instead of IP phone. Since you're using that IP phone, we can't pass it over to the new app. You have to have that RingCentral phone, the original option. Let me see. Hold on one second. Let me see if I can find that download link. Yeah, because I'm in the RingCentral desktop apps. I think that's the one. It only gives me one option, and that's the new app. Yes, I might have to see if we can still get you RingCentral phone, which was like their original. RingCentral app for end users. RingCentral. Did they? RingCentral meetings. Did they take it off the site? They must have taken it off the site. It only looks like there's one RingCentral app in there. RingCentral app for end users. They used to have the old one on their site, and it looks like they took it off. looking at the app gallery rc phone vmware i don't know what that means i don't ...
