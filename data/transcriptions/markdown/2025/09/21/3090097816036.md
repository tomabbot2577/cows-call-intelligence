## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello. Hi, is this Keith? Yeah. Hi, Keith. It's Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. How are you? Doing good. Thanks for the call. Oh, no problem. What can I help you with? Yeah, I'm just wondering about that note that I got. Obviously, there was a little bit of an increase in the price of, you know, a PC recruiter. and just wondering do I need to do anything to actually go in there and have this set up for auto pay like it always has been or is it already yeah yeah so the reason you have to go in and do it is we change billing system so we kind of been probably if it wasn't being paid and we still had a card noses we're probably processing that way but you'll want to go in use that invoice let me make sure it's right though yours your license for three users right right yeah okay let me just make sure yeah your license for three users it's a little bit of an increase is that CPI it's like a basically like the cost of living increase kind of stuff yes you're not protesting that I'm just wondering if there's anything I need to do yeah so on that invoice that was sent you do you have it it should have it would have been I've got a copy printed out I'm not right at my desk right now but yeah okay I can send it to you if you'd like I'll just hit resend it Keith at GC services calm right yeah that's right okay it looks like it's copied to Liz okay I'll just go ahead and send it to you in that invoice when you get it there's going to be a view and pay option and then all All you'll need to do is click on that, put in the card information, and then it'll enroll you in AutoPay as you're checking out. And then you'll be set up in AutoPay, just kind of like how you were like before, but in our new system. The new system is much nicer because you can get reminders automatically. There's actually now a, I believe, I don't know if it's in that invoice. I'll send it to you as well. But you can actually sign up for an account in our billing portal. I'll send that link over to you as well. So that way, if you ever need a change of a card, you can just do it right in the vault area of this billing portal. It doesn't use your PCR credentials. All right, I'll take care of it. Okay, yeah, it doesn't use your PCR credentials. So you'll just have to make sure you hit sign up on that customer portal link. Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks for the call back. Oh, no problem. And if you want, I don't know if you have the card handy, I can set it up with you, for you. It's up to you. I mean, I do have it. If I give you the number here, you want to just do that? Yeah. Yeah, if that's okay with you. Okay. So let me make sure. Are you ready? Let me make sure I got you up. Gilbert Consulting Services. Yes, this is you. Okay. I want to make sure I'm not putting your card on somebody else's because sometimes they have multiple screens open. Okay. What is the name on the card? Keith Gilbert. Okay. And then the card number? Yeah, 4246-3152. Okay. 2151-0561. 0561. And the expiration month and year? 728. 728. The security number? 704. Okay. And it's coming up with P.O. Box 1317, Araya Grande, California 93421. That's correct? Yes. Okay. So I will add the card. All right. And then I will go over here and I will set it to process on the due date. Okay. Update customer. Okay. And then, so the invoice that you have is $265.97. I'll go ahead and try to process that one now. Is that okay? Yes. Okay. And it usually takes a moment to sync. As long as everything goes fine, you're going to get a receipt emailed to you. If it doesn't, I'll reach out in a few minutes and let you know, but I won't keep you on the phone for that. You should get an invoice receipt emailed to you. Yeah, okay. That's great. so you can ignore paying the one I already sent because it should be paid. Okay, so I don't have to do anything, right? Correct. Now, if you want to, though, that one link that I sent you, the second email I just sent while we've been on the phone, that was the one to the customer portal. If you go into that one, you click sign up, and then you'll create a, you'll want to make sure you're using the Keith at GCServices.com email because that's the primary email for your billing. but then what you can do is if you ever want to go in and take a look at your invoices print them out change the card that's in the vault area okie doke appreciate your help thank you you are welcome have a great day you too bye-bye all right thanks bye-bye...
