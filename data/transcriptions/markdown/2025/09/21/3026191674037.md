Hey. Hey, how are you? Good. Yourself? I'm well. Well, I think we're just waiting on Jason, the trainer, to join us. He should be in momentarily. Sounds good. Now, I read your email. This shouldn't take too long, right? No, no, no. Just a quick intro call. So I'll have a few, just a couple things at the beginning. Jason has some questions to learn a little bit more about you and how you want to use it, what you're doing. And then we'll get the first couple of training sessions on the schedule. sounds good perfect yeah so so yeah so i'll be the one if you ever have to add users drop users change anything with regard to your contract or anything um i'm the one to go to for that uh how to's or training related issues would be jason and then also you can always dial the main support line or chat us or uh email us or anything like that that sounds good perfect perfect so it looks like jason has joined us uh he is your trainer jason are you hearing us Yeah, yeah, I can hear you guys. Awesome. Awesome. Very well. So yeah, so John, this is Jason. He's going to be your trainer on PC Recruiter. And he, I already told you kind of my role from here forward. So I wanted to turn everything over to Jason. He's just got a few questions for you today. Won't be long. We'll just go through and run through those and then get the first couple of calls on the schedule for you to get started on your training. Sounds good. okay awesome hi john i'm jason i'm going to be uh handling your pcr training um the questions i have are just going to kind of help me shape what our training sessions are going to look like and just make sure i hit all of the the beats that we want to make sure we hit um the first question is going to be uh what types of placements are you anticipating doing um like uh full-time placements contract placements like what what's your uh like permanent placements what are you thinking Yep. It'd be, it'd be for the most part permanent. It's, it's by gosh, I guess it's by need. So the way we operate is we'll have a company signed, but then once they're signed, it's always just until whatever they need or until it's terminated. So more so case by case basis. I'm not sure if that's the answer you're looking for, but that's how we kind of run. Okay. Okay, cool. That makes sense. And is there a specific industry that you're going to be working in? Yeah. So specifically, the majority of it is within the banking world, but then there is some crossover onto the legal side of things, but the primary focus is in banking. Okay. And have you worked as a recruiter before? Oh, yeah. Yep. I've been doing this for quite a while now. I've used PC recruiting in the past for about six, seven years. Okay. Yeah. So familiar. Now there is, like when Jim and I first connected, there is just obviously some updates and it's definitely looks easier to use. So all good things. But so I'll need to understand kind of like functionality, I guess, as an update. But again, it's something I'm definitely familiar with and I've used in the past. Okay, perfect. Are you going to have any other admin level users or is it just yourself? It'll be just me. okay in the next 12 months are you anticipating adding any additional users no no no okay um sure to answer myself okay so this next one's gonna revolve around like training speed and how quickly we get through things um so we have a fast moderate and slow pace fast would be three trainings a week moderate would be too slow would be one so in terms of that how are you feeling how many trainings do you want to knock out a week? How long does each one last? They're each going to be an hour long and you have a total of 10 hours. Okay. Give me one sec just to think about that. Would there be, because I am familiar, that's why I'm curious kind of what you think might make sense. So it's also flexible. Like we don't have to lock in on, if we say we want to do three we don't have to stay at three like if you knock out four sessions and you're like hey i think i'm good for a minute let's follow up in a week or two and we'll we'll pick up um because especially being that you've used pc recruiter before there's already some context there with you yeah um so i don't want to just like burn the hours because we have the time so um i would say like we probably maybe want to start at least moderate and then we can we can adjust the pacing as we go. Like it's very flexible. Yeah, we'll do that then. Yeah. Start with a copy. Cool. So let me just get through the rest of the questions I have and then we'll get something scheduled. What operating system are you using? Windows or Mac? Mac. Mac. Okay. And do you have a preferred browser? I use Google Chrome. Okay. Perfect. And who's going to be your email host? So that, yeah, I'm g...
