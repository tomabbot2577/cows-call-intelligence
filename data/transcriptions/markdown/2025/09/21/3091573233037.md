## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, how are you doing? This is Nick. Yeah, man, I just wanted to call in. Pretty urgent project. I was emailing Robin, and I was even on the phone with Brian Kane, and Brian told me to reach out to you specifically. Okay. But our team is just really looking to unlock more of PCR. And it would probably take us maybe like an hour or so on a call, if not two hours, but looking to just get a full understanding of our PCR and really just try to unlock what we're trying to do. If I can quickly explain to you, we're trying to do a couple of things. Currently, our team is only using PCR for email marketing, right? Okay. I'm pretty sure, like, you've helped me and other people at PCR have helped me on the phone a couple times to get things going with analytics, email marketing. That's what our team's currently using. I don't think we're using, like, we're probably using 5% of PCR right now. We're looking, because our team's growing. It's no longer, like, a little staffing agency of three guys. like we're about to have um i think eight people in total running actively on pcr starting on monday and i'm trying to basically use it as like a crm tool like for our game like a full-blown crm tool and i have like the map of what we want it to look like if i can quickly explain to you we're trying to have it be to where like the first thing that you see when you log in is the overall team's metrics. The second thing that you see is everybody's individual profiles. The third thing that we see is their individual performance, which would be like individual metrics. The fourth thing that we see is under one of the metrics, you actually see like key metrics like calls, links and in-mails, bulks. And then the fifth thing that we see is things like clients, pipelines, hot jobs, which you guys would probably call positions, candidates, and then the very last thing that we are able to see is like templates. So if that makes sense, we're trying to use PCR as like a full-blown CRM tool. Does that make sense? Yeah. So those options are all throughout like the main menu of PCR. The customization on what you see when you first open the page isn't really that advanced where you can, you know, see certain things and not see other things. But you can navigate to each one of those pieces just in the main menu, like your profile, I mean, your pipelines. And you can see where candidates are in the hiring process. You can see your clients under the companies. And then there's an analytics area to see your metrics for each user, even KPIs. So all those pieces do exist. And you can get to all of them from the main menu, it sounds like. Gotcha. And one of my concerns is I think that when I uploaded pretty much every client into the database, I'm pretty sure I did a name upload and not a company upload. That's one of my biggest concerns. It's okay that it doesn't look exactly like I explained it. I was even, because I'm the COO here, the CEO, gave me the vision. I was trying to explain to him that, you know, hey, I don't think it's going to look exactly like that, but I'm pretty sure we can get it. It just won't look exactly like that. And so we're willing to pay, though, Garrett, for a couple hours if you have time today. You could send me an invoice if you want to send me an invoice. but I'm really trying to get this project at least started today. Do you have any availability at all today to get this project started? Not today. I'm actually off the clock in about five minutes, but we can schedule a time in the future for a training if you need training hours. I've got availability tomorrow and the next day, as well as a lot of availability next week. Gotcha. What availability do you have? Let's just say tomorrow. Tomorrow I have 10 a.m. Eastern, 11.30 a.m. Eastern and those same slots are available on Friday the 19th. Gotcha. Why don't we just book tomorrow out like both of those slots for tomorrow? If we can, I mean, is that a 10 to 11 or Yeah, it would be like an hour's fun. yeah i would say i need about two hours like roughly two hours okay um would it be possible to maybe break those up instead of just doing a two-hour marathon uh training i think it might be um a lot to to cover in terms of trying to do two hours at once we usually just do hour blocks of training yeah i mean we could cover two um whatever you think like works best um and then If we don't get it all done tomorrow, we'd probably have to just go into Friday. Okay. But, yeah, whatever works best, so just let me know. So, yeah. That sounds good. Yeah, let's do the 10 a.m. Eastern tomorrow. I will have billing send over the invoice, and then I'll get you an invite sent out. And then whatever we don't cover, we can just schedule there next time for maybe Friday for an additional hour. Do you want to for sure have the invoice charge you for two hours or do you want to just start by getting ch...
