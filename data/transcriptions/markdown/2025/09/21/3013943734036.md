## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good morning, this is Jim. Jim, good morning. Craig Pickett, how are you? I'm well, Craig. How are you? I am good. What's happening in Ohio today? Oh, nothing. Just a little bit rainy and a little bit gloomy for the first time in a bunch of days, oddly, which is all right. Well. I don't know if you were even on the call this morning, but I'll tell you, may I give you a call back in like 20 minutes or so? Because I have a 10 o'clock that I'm supposed to be calling. Oh, was it on? Yeah, I wasn't on any call. I am free until 1130. Perfect. Yeah, just give me a shout when you're free. This should take 20 minutes or so. I'll give you a call right after that. Perfect. Sounds good. Very well, sir. All right. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
