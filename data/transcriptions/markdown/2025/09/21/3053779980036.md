## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you, Nicole, on Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. How are you? This is Alexia. Good. How are you doing? Doing good. I have a question for you. I am trying to set up some analytics in our database here, and I just got off the phone with my boss, and he wanted me to give you guys a call and see if this particular part of the analytics could be possibly customized. So I don't know if you need my ID to get into my account just to kind of take a look at what I'm talking about, or I can try to explain it to you prior. You let me know what it is. Let me just log into your database on my end. So you have four databases here, career building, e-commerce, elevated capital. Which one are you in? Career building, yeah. And then what is your username? It's just my first name, Alexia. All right. And, oh, wait, A-L-E-X-I-A. Oh, that didn't work. it's career building solutions but when I go into it like it says career building solutions on the url but I go into trusted human capital okay that's the database yeah there we go okay that worked all right so let me jump over to the analytics and then okay so which which part are you trying to customize so under placements and then when you go to placements you go to summary and then you can see all the placements that we've made since January to date this year. Okay. And so everything looks great here. My boss is asking if there's any way we could add tabs to this section of the database. He'd really like to see next to revenue. He asked if we could have like a tax section of like, you know, I guess what all the tax would be for each of these placements, the placement date, their start date, the date that they're due and if it's been paid or not. And I was like, OK, let me see if it's possible. I don't know how customizable it is, but I thought I'd at least give you guys a call and see what your thoughts were. Yeah, so for this part of it, there isn't really any options. The ones that you can customize are above that where it says metrics and then key metrics above that. And these are mostly based on activities that get recorded on a record. So every email that was sent out or any time somebody moved in a pipeline, an activity gets recorded automatically and then you can build metrics on the metric section. But when you get to that placements heading on the left there, those are all kind of free coded, kind of set in stone. The other area besides analytics that might be a place to look is reports where you can you could basically build a custom report that you tell it what fields you want to see or what information you want to see as you build that report. and then just run it as like a snapshot. So it's not like live updating like the analytics are, but you just go in and run the report whenever you want that snapshot. So, yeah, let me mark down some of the things that you wanted to see. And maybe I can research a little and find the right report or see if it's something you'd have to build. Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, and I think he's so particular. I mean, he really wants it to be, like, something where it's laid out exactly how you see it. And I already kind of told him, I'm like, I don't think that's possible. Because when I go ahead and, like, fill these out, you know, for it to even reflect, like, it doesn't give me the option to put any of those types of, like, you know, tabs in. The only thing I do have is, like, I have a start date tab, obviously, when I go and, like, place somebody. So I didn't know anything else could be added. but I personally didn't think it was. I kind of told him, I don't think so. I said, we should probably just like, you know, kind of just have something else that's like a live tally of, of what we have going on. Um, because I, I told him about reports as well and I don't think he was, he was very intrigued by it. He wants it as like a table on the dashboard basically, you know, that's always updating and kind of has something that he doesn't have to like physically go in and like make a reporter, like run a report for that's really what he's looking for so yeah yeah yeah so yeah that at least that part of the analytics but yeah i know yeah i see what you're you're mentioning there so yeah just that part of analytics you can't customize but um let me look at one other thing so if you are making a placement you can actually adjust what fields are shown on that pop-up window like where you punch in the start date and and um starting salary you can add things to that. But yeah, the only way to view them in a comprehensive way is in a report. But if you did want to keep track of that on the placements, we could like have a place for you to enter tax as its own custom field or something like that. Because that is customizable. But yeah, it's just necessarily like come up as like an additional column on this summary page, though, right? Right, exactly. Unfortunately not. Okay, okay. So what I'll do ...
