## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. Thank you. How can I help you? Yes, hey, good morning. This is Scott Shapiro. Your name again? Tyler. You said Hyatt? Tyler. Tyler, Tyler. Hey, Tyler, good morning. How are you doing, Scott? Doing very good. So I was hoping you can help me. So we are a Main Sequence PCR customer for nine years now. And we just signed up an account with MailChimp to help support our bulk email. Okay. And I need to be able to integrate PCR with MailChimp so that we can continue to do our bulk email out of PCR. I know of people that have PCR that have this capability. So I'm hoping you could help me get this set up. So a lot of times when people do that, did MailChimp provide you with like an SMTP server at all to be able to? No. It's a, what's it called, an SMTP server or like SMTP server information. Hold on a second. This would be, so I'm actually got a live customer support chat with MailChimp now. So I'm asking them for, it's the MailChimp SMTP server information? Yes. It's essentially what we can do. Because we don't have a direct integration with MailChimp. Right. I know some people have used Zapier as well. Yeah. So, okay. Okay, so, yeah, MailChimp recommended Zapier, so how does that work? Let me – I guess Zapier puts MailChimp and PCR together? Correct. Okay. So I guess if I talk to Zapier – Yeah, they will be able to help you create the connection. What you do in Zapier is you pick two apps to connect to each other Right I'm not very familiar with the MailChimp on Zapier I'm looking them up right now to see exactly how it ties to the two Let me Okay. Yeah, I just asked MailChimp support about the SMTP server info. It looks like they're typing back. Yeah, so essentially what you can do in Zapier is you can connect PPP to MailChimp. Right. So he just – I'm trying to look for that, but I'm not finding anything. You can find our SMTP integrations here. Let me just click on this and see. Okay, so it says, after you created a Mailchimp transaction account, you could find your SMT credentials on the SMT and API information page. The host for all accounts is, and so this is what he gave me, smptype.madrillapp.com. And then it says you can use any active API key for your account as your SMT password. Use ports 25, 587, or 2525 for non-encrypted communication between your system and MailChimp. Does any of this make sense to you? Yep. So we could try to – essentially, we could create a new alias for you in PC Recruiter that would send through MailChimp's servers. Right. But can the alias just be my – because I'm using MailChimp, the alias can still just be my normal email address, right? It doesn't have to change from Scott at Stay Gold Solutions, correct? Correct. It can be one and the same. Okay. Which is what I would prefer. Okay. Yeah, and that's if you want the campaigns to send out through PC Recruiter. Which we do. Okay. Because what you can also do with Zapier is when the – you can create a Zap that, like, when names are added to a roll-up list, it creates a new campaign in MailChimp. Yeah, like I said, we want to continue to do, first and foremost, what I want to just do is be able to just continue to do what we've been doing, which is sending our bulk email through PCR. Because, you know, as with our roll-up lists, you know, as they continue to grow, we could just send them directly out of PCR or edit them accordingly. I want to keep everything simple. The only advantage I saw by emailing out of MailChimp was that we could create logos and stuff that wouldn't be spam, but obviously you can't do that in PCR and that's fine. So what I'm going to do is take a look at your email aliases real quick. Yeah. So I have, so there's two active employees, myself and Alexis. Alrighty. Let me just see if I can set this one up. All right. And then what was that SMTP server that they gave you? It is smtp.maryapplenancydavidrobertindigolollipoplollipopapplepeterpeter.com. One more time for me. You cut out there. All right. It's smtp.maryapplenancydavidrobertindigolollipoplollipopapplepeterpeter.com. So it looks like manrealapp.com. All right. Did they say what you would need to use for your SMTP server or username? I don't see anything here. I mean, I could send you the link that they shared with me for the SMPT integration. So when you signed up, did you use the scott at stateholdsolutions.com as the email address that you signed up with MailChimp? I did use that email address, but that's not my username for the account, but I did use that email address, yeah. Okay, perfect. It's usually that email address, it looks like. and then that's not right i did sign up with that but that's not the username for my my mailchimp account but i think yeah yeah the smtp username is always an email address yep yep so it's the same email it's any email address perfect and then did they give you that api key or did they say like where to find one for you It says you can use any active API key for your account as...
