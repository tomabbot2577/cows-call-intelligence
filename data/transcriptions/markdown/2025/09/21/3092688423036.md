## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Robert. Hi, Robert. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence, PC Recruiter. Oh, hi. Hi, how are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I have a – we have PCR, and I've noticed a glitch or some kind of problem where all of these – a lot of the names in our database have the same company name added. Oh, okay. It's added to the default company name. So if we try to add them on the LinkedIn parser, we have to deselect the default company. Oh, okay. So that's probably a setting in your capture. Yeah, that's what I was figuring. But just a few details on it. So when we made the transfer over, the initial transfer over, we had like 150,000 names. And all of those, or most of those, when the transfer happened, in the company name slot, it says candidate profile or something. I don't know, but so in the company name, where the person works, all of those records said candidate profile as the company that they were in. So that's how it was tagged, I think. And then recently, like I would say, we started working with a third company, you know, to help us move through, you know, like to help us. It's a third-party company in India that they help us organize our data and whatnot. And I noticed that – I started noticing that a lot of the records, when I tried to go to enter them in via the LinkedIn parser, that they're already set to a default company. and one of the default companies was BPO Wizard. Now, that's the company that BPO is the company that we contract with. And then a week later, I noticed that all of the default company entries were a company called RCB Bearings. and then I noticed that today that all of those companies in that field all of the records it says it's called Okay so let's there's too many questions going on so let's do one at a time here okay so your database is a CB Associates okay let me see what you have for your default company okay well right now there is you're in the database called default company? I mean, you're in the database. Oh, sorry. Let me rephrase that. You're in the database named CB Associates. Okay. So it looks like you probably had a default company, and then it looks like it's missing. So it could be that maybe somebody changed the name of that default, but then made it not be a default. So let me see. if I can you're in my database right now yeah I'm looking right now it looks like there's a company called Coherent Corp yes so let me take a look at that company yeah yeah okay let's start there what's nice is that there's what's called a change log okay good which one was it that I saw there's like three of them in here. I think someone just, okay, so it's one without the, okay, so this company, let me look at the change log of it. Okay, somebody changed the name of it from BC Bearings to, so this is probably your default originally called candidate poll at least at some point. And then, so on August 12th, the username admin changed the name of the company from candidate pool to BPO wizard. Then they changed it from BPO wizard to RBC bearings. So whoever's logging in as admin is the one that kind of messed up this record. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know who did that. Okay. So here's what to do. if you go to company on your main toolbar type in the word coherent for the company name but it's the one that says coherent corp without the dot at the end without the dot yeah there's three when you just search for c-o-h-e-r-e-n-t three results come up. It's the middle one that just says Coherent Corp without the dot at the end. Okay. Got it. When you go into this record, I'm not sure what username are you in as? I may not have the same pinning as you. I go in as either Robert or Admin. Okay. What are you in right now? So that way I can tell you exactly. I'm as Robert. Okay, so let me go in this video so you see exactly what I'm... Okay, in case I have to talk about what's pinned or not pinned, I see exactly what you're seeing. Okay. Okay, so what happened is on this particular record, see how right after summary there's a three-lined icon? No way. So on that toolbar, when you have the company up or you have notes, associations, attachments, At the end of that toolbar, there's a three-line icon. Click on that, and it shows you a full toolbar. Then there's an option called Change Log. Click on that tile. Okay. So basically, this admin user went in and has been changing this one record. So we just got to change it back. So do you want it called Candidate Pool again or Candidates? What was your preferred wording for that default company? I want it for whatever the resume whatever's on the resume I want their original company well this is the the so the people are in this company it is I mean you've got a lot of people in this company this with the purpose of that with the purpose of the default company is is when you're not picking a company it's just a fake record that they go to it's a company record with a fake name, but we only want to have one default compa...
