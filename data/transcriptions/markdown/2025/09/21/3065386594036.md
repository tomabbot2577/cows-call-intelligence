## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Melanie Kirk. I figured out how to do that. So let me put... I'm going... Okay. Did I really... Yeah, I figured it out. But let me go back to it. I had it. Okay. Oh, there we go. Damn it. I just had it. I forgot what I called. Now, what are you going to try to do, the ACH? No, I'm just doing the payment. I was going to give you the credit card. Okay, so let me do something first. Advanced options. Let me do allow partial payments because right now. Oh, my gosh, I just had it. Okay, I'll say account. Okay, so you want me to go ahead and add a payment method, right? Right. George Payment Method. Right. However, I'm having trouble getting to it. Hold on. I just got to it. There we go. Okay. Okay. What is the card? It's MasterCard. Okay. It's 5143. Okay. 7730. Okay. 1533. Okay. 3155 okay and is the name on the card Melanie Kirk uh huh okay expiration 3 of 30 okay and the security number 425 okay and what is the address associated with the card 1250 Hunt Street okay apartment 1421 okay is it Richardson, Texas 75082 I'm going to add this card so bear with me one second because I'm only going to try to pay two of the invoices so let me see and that would be just under your 150 mark okay invoices okay I'm going to two. I'll go with the two oldest ones. Okay. And it'll be 146. Okay. And then what will be the balance? Well, let's see. Was it 365? Is that what I remember? 365.05. So let's see. Okay. So what we'll do is Hold on, I'm going to get my calculator out here. Okay. So if it's 365.05. Okay, so we'll take off 7301. So that would be 219.03. All right, so let me go into these separately. I'm going to do it this way. pay invoice ends with $3,155 $7,301 Okay, what's that CVV number again? I'm sorry. Hold on. Let me go back to it. Okay. I got out. Okay. Okay. This is so hard. I mean, this is ridiculous. You should just be able to see. Oh, there you go. All right. So you tap on that. Do you mean the security code? Yes. Yes. 425. Okay. All right. So I'm going to put that one in here. 425 and then create a transaction on that one. it says you paid 73 dollars and one cent but then there's a there's an issue with one of your others and maybe two you may not have enough i'm seeing you're looking at what's in my account i know exactly what's in my account i don't know why it's doing that one went through yeah i only processed one so far. Oh, okay. I'm doing these separately. I just want to make sure that it doesn't try to process multiple ones at once. Okay. Then I'm going to do pay invoice again on the same card. and what is 425 okay so the I have it yeah so those two are now paid the remaining balance is the $219.03. Now, I don't have it set up for auto pay. I just have the card stored. What we can do when you're ready... What day is auto pay? I'm sorry? What day is auto pay? Right now, it's not set up for auto pay. We don't want to do it yet until you can pay all of them. But what you are normally invoiced and so auto pay would be... on the 18th. No, I'm sorry. Is that 18 or 5? Oh, my gosh. My face is small and it's green. So you're normally billed on the 15th of each month. So your next one is going to be due 9-15. So between now and September 15th. Why has it not been coming out of the business? How come it hasn't been coming out of the business? Let me look at the business account. Hold on just a second. I want to make sure that these transactions haven't been coming out and they're going to the wrong place. Hold on just a second. because I don't understand why they haven't been coming out of the business. That would suck. We had to pay it back. Okay. All right. Small business. Did y'all lose the, because I don't have the routing number with me because I'm out. Did y'all lose the routing number for the business account for automatic pay? So when we switched billing systems, you had to put in your new card information. Oh. Okay. And so I didn't get the message. Probably, right, which is why I took off those late fees. Okay. When I get home, I'll add the business account to it. Okay. That way we can at least contract with a business account and now pay the rest off. Yeah. And then just to make sure, like just reach out to me if you'd like because I can, you know, help you get that set up. And then with the new site that we have, the new billing system, there's a vault area. So it's like if your card ever expires or things like that, you don't have to like call us up. You can just kind of go into the site and change it. You could also go in there and see your invoices. You can print receipts at any time. So it's a lot more convenient for you. Gotcha. Okay. Okay. And then what I'm going to do is, let's see. Let me see if I can get my pen scene out to do this. For some reason, when I try to log in to PC Recruiter, it says your account is not bound or is unavailable. Right. Because I have to have the database reactivated, which I'm going to ask them t...
