## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Good morning, this is Peggy. Hi, Peggy. This is Mackenzie over at PEC Recruiter. How are you? Oh, hi, Mackenzie. How are you? Doing well. I would like to get to the bottom of this ticket. I'm sorry, I was kind of confused before. but now I see the automation plan that's supposedly not working. Let's see if we can remedy that, if you don't mind. I really wanted to ask you if it would be okay if I could add my own record into the database and then, like, try to perform the automation to see if I receive it. Is that okay with you? Yeah, sure. I tried that with mine, and I only got the form letter. Okay. And I also checked her RingCentral account and there's no text messages, auto text messages being sent. Gotcha. Okay. So yeah, that was another question I had. Did you see if they were even being sent through RingCentral? No. Okay. Well, then that kind of answers the question. Well, it looks like, I mean, it looks like RingCentral is all set up correctly. And I see that she can send things and it will write outbound and inbound SMS messages in general, but maybe just the automation plan is not. Yeah, her manual texts are going through and they're being recorded, but the automation texts are not. Right. Okay. Huh. Which kind of told me it wasn't a RingCentral issue. Yes. Okay. That would be a good presumption. All right. Well, I'm going to add my name, if you don't mind, here. Sure. Hopefully that doesn't mess up too much stats that you may be tracking. And is there a particular pipeline I can test with? Yeah, why don't you try any of the Frito-Lay diesel mechanic pipelines? Okay. Okay. My cell phone number is in there. And I'm doing this as Marlenia. Sure. EV and diesel mobile mechanic Frito-Lay Brisbane I'll try that one yep perfect all right I'm going to type one I'm going to add myself she doesn't come in till 1 30 so this won't mess her up at all cool All right, I linked myself to the pipeline. And what triggers this? I got to go to a certain... I would try text email one. The text email one bucket has an automation. Oh, I have to... Okay, I have to expand recruiting, text email one. All right, I'm going to drag my name over to text email one. or actually I'll add it through the add step window. window. Setting a name to the stage will trigger the following automation. Send form letter. Attempt send SMS from two candidates. All right, I got resume received. The email. Thank you. I'm not seeing a text. Okay. All right. So it is recreatable. I might have to look into this on my own time. I'm going to try and see if I can get it to work in my own test database. And if I can't, then there might be something happening. I might have to, like, enter it as a bug. Okay. So sorry about that. Sorry about the confusion, too. I didn't realize that you were talking about the automation plan at first for Marlenia. Yeah. no problem reopened and i kind of skimmed through it and i kind of breezed over the fact that you're talking about that so sorry about that yeah no that's okay what's happening so i can go ahead and try to figure this out okay i was just so happy i set it up right this time yeah thanks to you did seem like it was good um okay yeah the automation does seem to be having some sort of hiccup. I'm not sure what it is, but I'll try and see if I can get it to work. If I can, I'll have to enter a ticket for that and we'll go from there. So, okay. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Yep. All right. All right. Have a good day. You too. Thank you. Bye....
