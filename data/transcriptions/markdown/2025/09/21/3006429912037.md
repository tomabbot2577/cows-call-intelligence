## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and close the session. Jim, how are you doing? I am well, Colin. How are you? I'm doing all right. Sorry for the delay there. You should be more on time. Oh, no problem. Jason actually just chatted me and said he's just getting off another training, running a little bit over. So he's going to join us in just a couple of minutes here. No problem. So what we're going to do today, yeah, we will, he has a series of questions that he'll want to go over with you to discuss how you're going to use the system, what specific integrations you're looking for, anything like that. Like since you're dimensional search, we know that you're going to want to set up RingCentral. We know you're going to want to set up HireEZ. And then he has some questions, just kind of the basics of like, oh, what do you use, PC or Mac? What do you use for email? Just a series of questions to kind of gain a little insight into what you're using now, how you work, etc. So he'll run through those questions there. So he's going to be the one to give you all the trainings, all your training and everything. I'm going to be the one, if you ever need to add users, email me. If you need to drop users down the line, any contract-related items and stuff, that comes right to me. Or if there is ever anything you don't know who to go to, find me, and I can either help you or get you to someone who can. Okay. That does lead me to immediately a couple questions. Sure. So I do intend on getting a SDR here very soon. And then I contact you and then we do the same thing? Yeah. Well, anytime you add a user, just pop me an email and let me know, and I can put a ticket in for my accounting team to increase your user count. And then no additional training comes with the new user unless you have some hours left. In that case, you can go ahead and schedule an hour with them or anything like that. we also have a learning management system some nice online help as well so we do have some other resources should you need to do that okay that's all I got thank you so much certainly certainly and then also the training so I think you're in the August 4th class are you I'm not I'm in the July 7th class oh okay that's today Jason will get something scheduled as soon as possible, maybe even as early as tomorrow. I don't know what his schedule looks like, but he always tries to get something scheduled ASAP. If you meet anyone else, most of your colleagues might have had a couple training sessions already, but not the end of the world. He'll get you strained up as quickly as he can, and we will go ahead and get a couple sessions under our belt. And then what will happen, Dimensional Search also has kind of a process that they go through, a scheduling training process. They will go ahead and train you a little bit, and then they'll pass you back to us. So you essentially have two teams training you on the setup use of PC Recruiter as well as recruiting. So you have a couple of different people helping you out there. So I think, Jason, you just joined us? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. Sorry for being a little late. No problem. Not a problem at all. Yeah, so I was just kind of talking with Colin about the basic setup, how we'll get everything set up. He is in the dimensional search training class that starts today, I think. So as quick as possible, we'll want to get him scheduled because we just got him in. So we'll go ahead and get that scheduled. I'll just turn things over to you to run through the few questions you have. I'll explain kind of how everything goes and that you have a few questions prior to getting something on the schedule with him. Perfect. Um, well, uh, hi Colin. Nice to meet you. I'm Jason. I'm going to be your trainer. Um, so the questions I have are going to be kind of help, uh, help me shape and guide the process of training and getting you up to speed with PC recruiter. Um, the first one I have is what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing? Like a full-time, uh, permanent placement contract? Like, what are you thinking? I'm thinking permanent placement. Okay, cool. Awesome. Um, if you ever decide to, uh, take a dip in the contracting stuff. Just let me know. There's contracting features inside of PCR and we can cover those if it ever becomes relevant. Is there a specific type of industry or niche that you're going to be focused in? Yes. We're putting systems engineers in the avionics industry and data scientists. Cool. Okay. Have you worked as a recruiter before? I have not. Okay. Awesome. Within the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? Yes. Okay. Once you reach that point, I imagine Jim had already said this, but just let Jim know, and he'll help you get all that contract stuff straightened out. Per...
