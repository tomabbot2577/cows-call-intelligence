## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning, this is Jim. Hey, Paul, how are you? I'm doing well. How are you? Sorry, I didn't have my sound on. How are you now? No problem. Very well. Very well. Well, thanks for joining me today. Yeah, so I wanted to talk a little bit. I think what we were going to talk about today is the sequencing piece for PC Recruiter and also the premium package that includes it, kind of what's included in that, etc. Yes, I think I had seen it one time quite a while ago. And I think with all the AI stuff going around and people talking to my people about functionality like that, I'm like, my people don't realize that PC Recruiter has some functionality that we don't use. So I wanted to refresh myself again and then maybe introduce it to other people as we kind of decide on some additional software potentially that we might use. So just so you know, I don't know if you know these guys. They say they integrate with you, but I think they might figure out how to integrate with you. Are you familiar with a company called Fathom? I've heard of it. Are they like a note taker? I think that's how they initially have sold themselves but they also do kind of a drip campaign I think and what they sold one of my guys on he's like look at this and I'm like we already have software that does that yeah yeah you just I just want to yeah yeah we do uh yeah so that is something a lot of times companies like fathom write their own integrations we don't even always know about it because we have an open API so sometimes they'll write it for another customer and then word gets out and they kind of start approaching our other customers, we don't even know. So they might have something like that, but it's certainly worth taking a look at PC Recruiter since we include it. So it's the next package up, essentially. So, yeah, let me share my screen to kind of show you a little bit about what it does and how it works and all that good stuff. So I'm going to share the screen. Let me know if you see my sign-in screen to PC Recruiter. I do. Okay, perfect, perfect. So what it does, the premium package of PC Recruiter is going to essentially add primarily three features to your existing database. So it would just add some new tiles up at the top of the screen here, notably analytics, sequencing. It would also add the email campaigns functionality. So that's going to give you the ability to do sequences completely within PC Recruiter. And the nice thing about our sequencing tool is it could be something that is merely emails only. So maybe send an email, wait three days, send another, wait five days, send another. Or you could make it something that could include calls, texts if you use RingCentral. You could include a reminder to schedule an event, a reminder to do something on LinkedIn. So let's take a look at what it does. So if I click into the sequencing up top, it opens up a whole new tab initially. So you're still going to have your PC recruiter open, but it opens up a whole new tab. And then you can go in here to the templates. And this is where you are able to design what your sequences are going to do. If you add it, you do get these two templates come with the system for free. So they're kind of pre-populated. You can change them or make them your own or create your own as needed. But if I go in here and I go to edit a template name, nope, nope, nope, that's not one. I want to go to branches. at branches. This is where you're able to essentially build kind of the framework of what's going to happen. Usually, the first step is going to be send an email. So you're able to kind of pick which form letter, and it's merely a form letter as part of your PC recruiter database. Then you're going to be able to see if they reply to the form letter, they're done in this case. But if no interaction occurs in three days, but you might make that four days or nine days, continue to the next step, which is going to be a call. So in this case, it'll add them to a call list if they don't interact with it. And then that's kind of in that task list we just saw there a minute ago, which we'll go back and visit. But when you make that call, and I'll show you how we do that, you can either say, you can mark it connected, left message, no answer, and you're able to take each possible outcome and just designate what happens once you select that outcome, and then it would go, in this case, to another email down here. So this one's a little more interactive. I think it's only a few steps. So I think this one's just yeah, so it's email call email Yeah, very simple, but it could be some people creepies and they're like 10 15 steps and Option a would wrap them down another branch and you can get really fancy I like to keep it simple and a lot of people it might just be Three emails over two weeks or it might be ...
