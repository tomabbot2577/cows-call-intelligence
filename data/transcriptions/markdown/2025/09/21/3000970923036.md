## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Ginny. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I see you were opening a chat with our support. Were you being helped at all, or can I help you? No, I was interested in learning about, thanks for calling, about the PCRM and what that is. Okay, perfect. I can have Jim Lombardo, our sales rep, reach out to you, give you a demo, give you all the options there. Let me drop an email to Jim. What's the best email to reach you at? ggarner at thegarnergrp.com. Okay. Yep. All right. I will have Jim reach out, and he can give you all the options and pricing for switching over to that, And he'll give you a nice little demo so you can try it out before you buy it in a way. Yeah, no, I'd love to see what it does and see. Yeah, I know nothing about it except someone told me that it's kind of a PCR light of some sort. So that's all I know. Right. Yeah, it's designed for kind of like a user-friendly experience in mind. It's definitely a different look and feel to it that we've kind of upgraded, gave it a facelift. So it's more for everyday use where you don't have like a million options to do the same thing like you do in PCR 9. It's just kind of streamlined in a way. Yeah, no, that's what I hear. I hear it much easier. I'm a solo person at this point. So it's just and I might even start my database or revamp it a little bit. So there's perfect timing to look at what's going on there. Awesome. All right. Well, I will have Jim reach out and reach out if you need anything else. Okay. Thank you so much for the call. Thanks. Bye....
