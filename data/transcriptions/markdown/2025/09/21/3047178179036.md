## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. My name is Evan. I'm calling from V20 Recruiting out of Dublin slash Columbus, Ohio. Yeah. Trying to access my PC recruiter account, and it just keeps me on the login page and says loading. I'm also being prompted to install a launcher for either Windows or Mac. I haven't had any issues. Yeah, that download link is just always there. Okay. I don't recall seeing it before. Yeah, it's always on the bottom left there. Do you normally leave your computer on overnight? No. Let me take a look here. What's your username for the database? It should just be Evan. Let me in right away. So what we're going to try and do here is in the top left-hand corner of your browser, are you using Chrome? Yes. Click the three dots that are in the top right-hand corner, and then you'll go to where it says Delete Browsing Data. Okay. Yeah. and that'll open up another screen excuse me i got a hiccup out of nowhere that'll open up another screen to clear your browsing data you want it set to advanced the time range set to all time and the only box that you want to have checked is the one that says cached images and files. Okay. And then hit delete? Yep. Okay. And then once that's done, go back to your PC Recruiter login page and just refresh that tab. Okay, it's loading. It says your account is not found or is not available at this time. Please contact technical support. Like when you're trying to – are you using a VPN by chance? No. It didn't even give me the option, like, where – since I didn't delete the stored passwords and whatnot, it should usually just pop up with my username and password. and I just click log in and it goes in, but it's not even showing me the username and password field. Right there is where it pops up and says the account is not found or available. Gotcha. So in your address bar, what's the full website that's up there? www.tcrecruiter.net slash e-c-r-b-i-n slash e-c-r-n-f. dot A-S-P question mark U-I-D equal sign O-D-B-C dot L-O-N-S-K-I. Associates, Lonsky Associates, and signed style sheet, one word, equals default. All right. It looks like you might have an old link there. So what I'm going to do is send you the new one. Okay. Was there an update or something recently? No, but sometimes old links just eventually die. Okay. So let me send you this one. Okay. Oh, excuse me. I got the hiccups. No problem. All right. I just sent that over to Evan at V20recruiting.com. so you should get it here in just a second. Can I see it? Click the link? Yep. Okay. Alright, that opened up in Microsoft Edge. I don't know if that matters. Oh, you can copy the link and paste it into Chrome. Okay, gotcha. It says www.pcrecruiter.net says your account is not available at this time. If you have any questions, please contact technical support. And then it says parenthesis zero colon error parenthesis. All right. Let me take a look at one more thing in the account here real quick. because it sounds like you have something because I can get to your account right away sounds like you have something that's maybe blocking you from accessing it like on your computer okay Just seeing. Have you installed any new programs on your computer recently? No, nothing has changed recently. All right. I'm going to send you a link here to do a quick screen share just so I can take a look and see what is going on. Okay. That way we can check, make sure it's not like an extension or something that you have running causing an issue. Thank you. All right. I just sent that meeting link on over to you. You should get here in just a second. Okay, I got it. It's loading. All right. And then if it asks you to connect your camera or audio, you can just exit out of the box because we're already on the phone here. Okay. And just click continue without audio. and then at the bottom of the meeting window you'll see a blue box with an arrow in it that says share and you'll want to share your entire screen so under the entire screen option you'll just click on which screen you want to share you'll highlight it in yellow and then you'll hit share in that pop-out box. Okay. Perfect. All right. And then can you go to the PCR HTML interface just so I can take a look there? Go ahead and give that page a refresh for me. So it just does the loading there. And then sometimes I forget if it's up here or here, but that green bar will pop up until about halfway. And then I think only one time this morning I've gotten the box with the credentials. All right. Can you click the puzzle piece up in the top right-hand corner for me? Go to manage extensions. All right. So you only got the one. Go ahead and exit out of here for me. And then it's not loading like this for other web pages? the other ones have been fine if I'm not mistaken yeah alright go ahead and exit out of the YouTube page there it popped up now so I did notice that your Chrome is out of date as well okay so that might ...
