## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for joining me for this technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi. It's Anita San from Intuition Financial Placement. How are you? Good. How are you doing? Good. I got a new PC. I'm going to give you my tech guy. He's installing. He needs some help with the Atwell plugin. Oh, okay. Okay. His name is Mohammed. Hey, this is Mohammed. Hope you're doing well, bro. Good. How are you doing? Good, good. Thank you. We're setting up a new computer for Anita, and I was able to get the PCR Outlook plug-in pretty much up and running with everything. The only thing I'm having trouble with is the fact that whenever I open Outlook, it prompts me for the license number, and then it tells me the license is invalid. But on the old computer, the license status seems to be valid. So I'm not sure what's going on. So let me look up. So are you with Intuition Financial Placement? Yes. Okay, let me make sure you got the right serial number there. One second. Okay, yes, so that is, that number would be 386-355-071-1897. Is that the one you were? Okay, let me double check to see if the license is expiring anytime soon sometimes you get a message there I could just reset that right now it is okay that one's giving me license ID not found okay let me see something must be up here intuition financial placement you have portal okay I'll look it up by Anita's name here. Let's try this. Okay, that looks good. Okay, let's try, I'm going to give you a second number here. Let's see if this works. Where is it? Here we go. So it's a long number again. It's 167. Oh, sorry. All right, go ahead. So the new number, let's do 167-328-274-781-789. All righty, fingers crossed. Yep, that seems to work. Awesome. All right, yeah, let us know if you have any other issues like that, but you should be good now. Copy. I guess a bit unrelated, but it seems like whenever I close out of Outlook, it doesn't just, like, and I try to open the app again, it doesn't just open and I have to, like, go into Task Manager and kill a background process. Go ahead. Yeah. I've seen that before, too. I'm not sure what causes that. Sometimes other add-ins are, like, kind of not playing nice with our add-in and it takes a long time to close down officially. Okay. That helps. Is there like a Microsoft Teams add-in or some other add-in that you might not use that you could disable possibly? I'm not sure. Yeah, there is a Teams one and Adobe. Let me try that, see how it goes. Okay. Okay, that killed the background process actually, and this time it's opening fine. Awesome, perfect. I'm glad I asked. Thank you. Awesome. Yeah, no problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Will do. Can we test it before you end up? I'm just in trouble getting it. Say what? Say it one more time? Can we test it? It's good. I'll open it again and not get the license problem. All set. Thank you so much. Awesome. Have a good one. Bye-bye....
