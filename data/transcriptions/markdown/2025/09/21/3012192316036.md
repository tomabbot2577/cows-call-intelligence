## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Robin, what's up? Hey, I'm so sorry. I was in a training session with this thing. This My Job Matcher, I think we kind of relabeled the original Princeton one. This one was just like so weird because remember they kind of like were here as Princeton, then they were Job Com, and then it was Job Matcher, and the whole thing was a little confusing. so I didn't really know if it was going to be kind of treated separately at the time so I think it's really the same so I don't know if we want to merge them or what that was the one they owed us like they kind of like disappeared for like a while and owed us a whole bunch and then uh oh what did my email do The My Job Matcher was really, I believe, the one that I created new, thinking it was going to be kind of separate with Mark Gust as the main person. I didn't really realize it was still going to be so much of Princeton. so the only thing really on the my job matcher is Mark Goss being the signer my billing notes for the pricing terms I do have a QuickBooks ID though but really like a lot of those contacts are under the one that says also known as Princeton 1 which you might want to just so if we did merge them I think we should change instead of aka formerly or was it formerly known as and then the thing was saying is my job matcher but then they seem to be going by job.com more than anything so yeah this whole thing was just a little straight away from the typical process yeah okay well that that makes sense at least yeah this is the one yeah it was kind of like I think Bill was just like get an invoice out to them because he was like I think they had like 20 grand or like it was like a big he wanted that money and then invoice it for this. Bill was more concerned with the invoices to get that money in and then all the details were a little... Yeah, I just wanted to check because it was it came up in my outreach thing. I had them to the high profile customers and I was like oh why are there two of these yeah i would i would just make sure too that the billing notes did you merge them or no no i haven't touched them yet and i am not going to write the second um okay because i want to take a look at it first okay there's one that is just the job master from utah i guess i mean i got that address from them so i think that's probably the one to keep. That one has billing notes about how they're tiered. I have it in the customer notes in QuickBooks, but I also want it on the company record because they are very different. They offered them tiered pricing, which we don't normally do. Honestly, it's a pretty good idea, though. It is. Hey, you want to get big? Great. Right. There are people that are going to grow. So it's definitely a good idea. Yeah. And then what I did even for their invoice template, like their recurring, I put all four rows. Yeah, I looked it up. The four rows. So that way all we have to do is just fill in a number. Yeah. On that row and not kind of like redo all these crazy things. Oh, oh, oh, oh. While you're here. Yeah. I talked to Kathy yesterday. Oh, you did? Oh, is she going to actually reply to you? Are we on the shit list with her? I kind of got the hint from Bill that maybe. She only talked to me. Yeah, she talked to me because she talked to Bill, and Bill said that I was going to reach out. And she didn't have my number and stuff, so I made sure that she had all that info. So what she said about, I brought up the invoicing issue that you were talking about where they're going in and making changes, and it's messing things up. what she said that at least for right now um we're gonna meet next i'm gonna meet with her next week again and talk over everything because i wasn't there for your initial like whatever i know you and liz did that and i think i should i i would like for her to walk me through some of this stuff so i know what she wants and what's going on um and i also told her i want to make sure that we don't step on each other's toes. So like you were saying, there's too many cooks in the kitchen. So if we have like a standard process that we use, that'll make it easier. But for right now, they, she said that they. She knows why now. Yeah. She knows why it happened now. I think it was somebody that would maybe working like doing some work with her for her. I don't think it was Kathy. Yeah. It sounded like so. So. But what she said that we can do, and I agree with her because I think it's easy, in the notes, you can put a quick thing that says that there was a user change in the date. And then if they go in and adjust something, then it would. They wouldn't override anything. Oh, she complained about that. I go, nobody really even used notes until me started putting things in. so we're not going to do that every time somebody changes things we're just not what they needed to do is not go in and change like this is on them not us so and and here's the thing like how many times do people change users i dropped from three to tw...
