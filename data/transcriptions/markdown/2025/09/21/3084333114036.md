## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Maid Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, I need some help with a small database issue. Something was changed in my setup and I'm not sure how to change it back. Okay, what is your name? My name is Diane. Okay, and your last name? That's Danik. V as in Victor, A-N-I-K. I'm with Ezra Penland. Okay. What changed? So under the name section. Under designation. There's now a pop-out, which we've never had there before. Should be able to add and remove within that line. Could be that an administrator changed maybe the designation. I guess it would be a custom field. That's what I was trying to figure out. And I'm an administrator. Oh, you're an administrator? Yeah, but I haven't changed a thing. and I know there's two others and one wouldn't do anything so I don't know. Okay let me see here. Let me see what's going on. And I'm sorry I'm going to go ahead and go into Zeus since you're an administrator so I can see the actual field but then also look at the field setup. What is your PCR username? I don't need the password just the username. It's dvanik. D-A-N-I-K. Gotcha. Okay. G-B-A-N-I-K. I should probably be mistyping my password. Okay, so you said the field name is designation. Mm-hmm, just designation. Okay. So being a custom field, what it looks like, is you could type in there, and really what happens is that pop-out is really just showing you other fields that are other values that are in use on other records so every value yeah so in this line designation we we put multiple designations and we've we've never I'm I'm assuming somebody had to have changed this. Yesterday or this morning. If you go up to system. Yeah. And then go to custom fields. Name. And then name custom fields. Where's your designation field? So I was looking for it. I know. And there isn't one there. And I'm like, okay. Gosh, that's almost like someone deleted it. Hold on one second. Let me see. Why is it? How is it even? Hold on, let me see something here. Customize designation. Now there's level designation. Let me see, what is that? That's a dropdown. And that one still exists, right? It does. OK. Let me make sure you still have, I mean, you would still have data for it. It sounds like somebody deleted the field, to be honest. I don't know why. Stink. Hold on one second. Let's see. You didn't lose any data. That's good. It doesn't look like it. It's a strange. Got a lot of weird values in this field, though. Some are years and some are. Okay. Here's what I think you could do is if you go to system, go to, oh, wait. Now, how was this field set up before, do you think? So it was just like, for example, it wasn't a dropdown. It was, if you look at list exams and you can add and remove, it was exactly like that. Do you think anybody changed it instead of using designation? They made it level designation? No, we've always had that. The way we have it set up, just to give you a little background, in the qualifications we have the discipline, which is like life insurance, health insurance, property and casualty. The designation was always an open line, like the add and remove. We put multiple things in there. For example, somebody could be an actuary who's a fellow, which there's a designation FSA. And we put FSA and the year they became a fellow, like FSA 2010. And they may also have another designation that's pertinent, something like what's called an enrolled actuary. So we would also put that. So we could have multiple things in that same designation line, like it would say FSA 2012. And it would also be able to put an EA. I'm sorry? Were they free types? Yeah, you could add and remove. It was the add and remove. Okay. Let's try this back. The level designation and the designation year have always been there like that as well because the way we search for things. And then the list exams, the way that's set up right now where you can add and remove, that's exactly how designation was. It was that way yesterday, but today it's not. So that's why I'm like, what? Yeah, it's a multi-select. Okay. Oh, that's what it's called, multi-select? Yeah, there's multi-select and then there's multi-select checkbox. So multi-select, I'm actually glad to hear it's kind of like that, where it just means you could free type, but they're treated as separate answers or selections. Because if you did have values, I don't think I have a way to bring back values that you had before. Actually, you know what I'm going to do? Oh, wait a minute. What am I thinking of? Okay, here's what you're going to want to do, though. You're going to want to go to system and go to custom fields, custom name fields and then click add okay so I'm adding it back in yeah you're going to add the field name back in and then for action you're just going to select number 14 multi-select okay so I'm going to type designation back in yeah before you save it though let me let me just kind of see like if I can get in there what's called snapshot. Sometimes what I could do is s...
