## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. You're right. May I help you? I'm Connie Rose with Alexander Raymond. You have me under Connective Services. And I had this problem once before, and I thought it was resolved, but it's back again today where PCR capture is not popping up in my LinkedIn area, and I'm not sure why. I've refreshed the screens. I've logged out, logged back in. I've done a few things. And I do know that my PCR capture, I'm logged in because all of the boxes are live, LinkedIn recruiter, recruiter live, all that. Oh, right. So I'm logged in. But I don't know. I can't remember the scenario last time, but it took us a minute to get on. And, you know, it's such a handy little tool. I don't want to not do it because I have these problems. Sure. Let's jump on a screen share call. I'll take a look at what you're seeing. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. And I have a meeting ID whenever you're ready for that. that okay right that is seven one nine three nine one seven three eight I'm going to join by computer audio because I've got you on the computer. You could continue without audio or just mute that since we're already on the phone with the mute button at the bottom left and then click the blue share button down below and select your entire screen up at the top if it lets you you should be seeing my LinkedIn page which is on another monitor but perfect Yep, I can see that. All right. So we're on a profile here. Just click that refresh button at the top left real quick just to see. Yeah, I did that. I'm hoping that when I get support on the line, it fixes itself. Sometimes it does do that. It's funny. Okay, at the top right click the, I think it's like a puzzle piece icon or maybe it's like a half eaten cookie. Now, I'm not in Chrome. I mean, Chrome's on another screen. So you want me to press this one? Yeah, click on that one. Okay, that's the problem. So you need to have the PCR capture installed on whatever browser you're using. You don't have it installed on Edge. You do have it installed on Chrome. So let's do this. Let's try this. I did not realize that. Let me go to LinkedIn here. I'm going to share screen. OK, so the puzzle piece is here. OK, so I'm just going to X out of capture. Let's put the same person's name in. Perfect. And let's see if it pops up. Okay, now I know. That was the whole problem before. Gotcha. We need to put it right where the app or the gadget is, widget, whatever you want to call it. Yeah, exactly. But we can install PCR Capture onto your Microsoft Edge browser if you prefer to use that. We can have it on both browsers. I could walk you through that if that would be helpful. I'll do that. Let's see, let me go here to maybe manage extensions. I can find it in here. So you would – I could show you. You'll probably just have to go to the Learning Center in PCR to get the download link. So if you want to go to – let's see. You can go to – do you have PCR inside of Microsoft Edge as like a bookmark? I have PCR on Chrome. Oh, okay. Let's see. What's a different way to get there? If you just want to go to a new tab in Microsoft Edge and just go to learning.pcrecruiter.net. There you go. Yeah, you could take you could use this browser tab that you're on now and just in the web address field type in learning PCRecruiter.net perfect. Yeah PCR PC recruiter Net net net perfect. Yep And That'll take you to Learning Center here and we'll go to the middle where it says additional tools click on that And then on the left go to the PCR capture tool Okay, and then go to PCR capture setup that will give us in that article the link Alright yes scroll down a little bit we'll see below the video there's going to be a step one that's underlined that you can download the PCR capture extension here there it is at the top of the screen there was a step one a little bit higher now download there it is download PCR capture extension under the purple there you go and then at the top click get extension and kind of the black box up at the top and allow and add extension so that'll install the extension to Microsoft Edge and now you can click on that puzzle piece icon there that you were just on and pin PCR capture with the little pin icon. There we go. And then you'll still have to sign in to capture now that it's installed. So if you just want to click on that logo at the top right, the PCR capture logo, it'll prompt you to put in your PCR web address. And so you can grab that by opening up PCR in maybe in Chrome and copy and paste your web address into there. Perfect. Click login and then just put in your username, password, and database. I had to go in and... Is it case sensitive? Yeah, the password is. Not the username, but... Give me the I so we should do this right. Go on. Okay. Perfect. Yep. So now you're good to go in both browsers. It should work on LinkedIn for either case. And then if you already have LinkedIn pulled up in Edge here, you'll just have to hit refresh ...
