## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, you've reached the phone of Tom Hodges. Please leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you at my earliest. Have a great day. See you. Bye-bye. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hi, Tom. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Sorry I missed your call. I'm kind of bouncing between a lot of emails today. Anyway, so you're basically your contract, you're kind of committed for a certain term like length, but you can add and remove users as you need to. You just need to let us know to adjust the billing. So let's say for example if you are, let's see what are you currently at, I believe you, sorry, you are currently billed for, it looks like three users. So if you have like three users, let's say you decide to go down to two, you would just have to let us know and we adjust your billing for the next invoice and then so your next invoice is adjusted to three. Now if this person doesn't work out you would just have to let us know to make a user count adjustment for your billing and then we would drop it back down. So your next invoice is scheduled for three users, your last one was at two so it looks like they already put that change in for you. So as long as you let us know of increases or decreases in user counts before the next billing cycle, we would go ahead and adjust that for you. Hope that answers your question. And if not, give me a call back. I do have a lot of scheduled calls. But if you have any specific questions, either leave me a message or just shoot me an email, robin at main sequence, R-O-B-I-N at main sequence dot net. Thanks. Bye....
