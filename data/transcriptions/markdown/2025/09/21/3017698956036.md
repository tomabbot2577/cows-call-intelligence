## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yes, I use PC Recruiter, and for some reason, it usually is auto-saved on my computer, the password, and for some reason it wouldn't work today. So I went to go reset my password, and I can get in right now to PC Recruiter online, but when I go to the actual app to use the application, it won't let me in, if that makes sense. So what do you mean by PC Recruiter? Like you're logging into your database? yeah so when I log into the database it won't do it it won't let me use the password but if I go to like your guys's website of like I forgot my password but then I log in that way I so those those are two completely different things oh okay like where you go to like submit a ticket that's completely separate than your database password oh okay so that's just our ticketing system oh gotcha so so how do i get get to knowing or changing my password so i can use the actual database so there's a few ways you can kind of look up your stored passwords Okay. Which company are you with so I can look you up here real quick? The Chastain Group. All right, let me... Okay so in order for you to change the password it would need to be done by an admin level user in your organization. we might be able to find your old password here because Google will save those are you using Chrome as your browser yes okay click the three dots that are in the top right hand corner okay and then in that list you'll see one that says passwords and autofill okay and then click Google password manager. You should see a list there. One should be PCrecruiter.net. It says add shortcut passwords. It says save passwords will appear here. There's nothing that shows up though okay so you don't have like a list of sites being born under passwords you don't see like a list of them uh-huh okay so you might have accidentally cleared all those out so what you would need to do is talk to your database administrator and they can go in and reset your password for you Oh, okay. Otherwise, we would have to send that same person, we'd have to send the contract signer for your account a password authorization reset form, and they'd have to print it out, physically sign it and send it back. So if you have access to like, have your database administrator do it, that's usually the quickest route. Okay. Because it looks like it's the same person. It looks like the admin level user in your database is Rick Chastain, and he's the admin level user in the database as well. Okay. Is it like a simple fix for him to do? Yep. Yeah, I can actually email you the instructions here as well. Just if you wanted to send that to Give me two seconds here And what's a good email address for you? It would be natalyn n-a-t-a-l-y-n at thechastangroup.com? Correct. Oh, excuse me. I had a little tickle in my throat there. All right. And then let me grab these instructions for you here real quick. Lord, do you know that you are the only one who can do it. Lord, do you know that you are the only one who can do it. Lord, do you know that you are the only one who can do it. Lord, do you know that you are the All right. I just sent those instructions on over to you. I just want to verify that you get them here real quick before we get off the phone. Yes, I did. Perfect. So, yeah, just give those instructions to your database administrator, and then they'll be able to update that password for you. And then you'll be able to log in. Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Yep, not a problem. You have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye....
