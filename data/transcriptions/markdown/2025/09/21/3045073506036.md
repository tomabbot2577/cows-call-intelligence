## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by your name. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning, this is Jim Hi, this is Tia Hey, Tia, how are you? I'm good How about you? Not too bad, not too bad And is anyone else, I think there's two other people joining us today, is that so? Anne is, I just got off the phone with her I'm not sure if Maria is going to be able to make it Okay, no worries, no worries So we'll give Ann just a couple of minutes to get in here. And did you get my email? Did you have a chance to take a look at that video about the HireEasy integration? Yes, I did. Unfortunately, they don't give me a demo account, so I don't have any way to show it live. So that's why I wanted to make sure you had a chance to look at that to develop some questions and see if I could help because I don't have any way to actually show it. But I'll answer any questions that you have on that there. Yeah, I do have some questions. I think Anne has some questions too. So I guess the question for us is, yes, we have all these names in our database, right? Our industry is very niche, pretty much based on certain titles. I think when we have our assistant help pull up like roll up list for us, she's just putting in the name of the job, but sometimes we type bit differently. Like, so just for example, a director of nursing, we might type it in the PCR under title is BON, director of nursing. Sometimes we have positions called nurse consultant. Sometimes it gets typed in as nurse consultant. Sometimes it gets typed in as NC. Sometimes it It gets copied as Regional Nurse Consultant or RNC. So I'm not sure when those roll-ups are created, like how they're being pulled to give us a database of candidates. So I guess my question also is, if we are, so when we search for candidates on Indeed or on LinkedIn and we are able to add them to our database, I guess, is the HireEasy going to be able to help us pull more specific candidates already within the database, and how is it going to do that for us? Okay. Excellent. Excellent. So, um. Anne is on. Hey. Yeah. Good morning, Anne. Okay. Anne, did you hear me with the question? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, that was an excellent question. I'm going to share my screen just to hop in here. So you have a database that's already full. You're doing searches within the database. I believe what's going to happen, so as you're pulling people in from Indeed, are you using Capture by chance? Yes. Okay, so as you're pulling people in, I think to my understanding of the HireEZ, it should be able to do that, but I don't think it's automated. So what it will do is like when you have your record in PC Recruiter, you could, from their action menu, you can go ahead and say update via HireEasy. And if you click that update via HireEasy, that is going to go out and I believe find more information on that candidate. So it's going to go ahead and try and find additional numbers, additional emails, stuff like that. And then I think it even gives you a little option to click to update into PC Recruiter. To my knowledge, there's no way to do that en masse, so it's more of a one-off to do something like that. Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure how that benefits to go through and find more names. I mean, you know, it's not like, you know, we have pretty much the same kind of keywords. so if we pull up somebody and let's say it's a director of nursing and then we're going to go hire easy and try to find more information about that person so essentially we might be able to get a phone number or an email address because the way that we do is we just call in directly we call directly and get the person on the phone yeah so i don't know that i'm just trying to figure out how this might benefit yeah i don't know that that would one that might the zoom info has a few more integration points into PC Recruiter it's more expensive but the zoom info offers one of these up here at the main in the main search that you can opt into zoom info clicking that will launch zoom info and then you can do a search and pull a group of records from zoom info into PC Recruiter so that's going to let you at least mass import like a list into PC Recruiter where if the higher easy doesn't so that might give you a little added help there to be able to search zoom info and pull it in that way that might be another suggestion to do that so I guess what is so what does I guess it's not confusing for me to understand what higher easy really does that to my knowledge what they are and I've never used them but what they are is they're a data enrichment tool so if you have a record you can go into higher easy and I can look up John adcox and I can try to find a mobile number for him a home email a second email something like that so if I understand it what they are is they're primarily just data enrichment so if you have a record you can kind of deep dive with that name...
