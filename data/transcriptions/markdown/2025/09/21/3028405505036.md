## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Martin. Ah, it's Jim. This is Linda. Oh, hi, Jim. How are you? Real well. How are you doing? Well, I'm kind of laid up in bed. I had to get some cortisone and some nerve blocks in my back for a vaccine. Mm-hmm. That's it. But I'm working. I don't know if I have my laptop here. But the new thing that rolled out, I saw your second message saying, that it should already be on first interview? I mean, first PCR? Yeah. I don't know if I can get my laptop. Let me open it. I have it here. Because I can't open it. You know, for some reason, I can't open it on my phone, your app. Oh, maybe it needs updated. It must need it updated. What do I do, delete it and reload it? I think you should be able to go, like, into your app store and just find it and update it from there. I don't think it'll prompt, that I know of, it doesn't prompt you. Like, sometimes your banking apps or your credit card apps will say, oh, you need an update. I don't think ours does that, but you should be able to just go to the app store and update the app from that. I don't know that we've updated recently, but maybe it just needs re-downloaded. Yes, okay, I'll do that. And I'm waiting for this to boot. So what is the new, what is the, is it an app or what is new that you guys have? Sure. What we recently have been kind of touting because they gave it away as a free trial for the summer is the AI suite. So we've added some AI functionality. And what we did is we applied it to everybody's database for the summer. Three about Labor Day is when it's going to be turned off. But what it does, it's kind of four main components. Three of them are content generators. So we've added, like, on the job description field, there's now a little button at the top of that that if you click it, it's going to produce a job description. And it will produce a job description kind of using the information found in the company record and the job record in the fields and stuff like that. So it'll make you a little job description. very similar functionality on the candidate summary screen. There's a little, that same little AI button. It's like kind of purple and blue and it looks like our logo, an outline of our logo. The candidate summary one will generate a candidate summary based off of information found in the candidate's fields and in their resume, if they have one. So those two... Wait a minute. Oh, that's first interview. Hold on a second. Let me find it. PC recruit. Is this it? Hold on. Okay. Oops. Yeah. So at least I can find it. See, all I see is new. Whenever it opens, it says, do you want it like in a soft, not a square, but in those soft angles or whatever it's called. And new and improvements, changing to capturing records. Those are the only things I've ever gotten to for any kind of notification. that was they put they add a kind of a new rounded look to some of the buttons so so that was a while back I mean that's the only thing I really got but hold on pc recruiter I'm going to make sure it's loading slowly but sure yeah so to kind of talk at the the third part there's an email generator. So that is going to, it adds that same little, that little PC Recruiter AI icon. And what that'll do, that is going to help you generate an email. So it's a little more like ChatGPT, if you will. So if you click it, it's going to ask you whether you want a friendly tone, a formal tone, an instructive tone. Then you pick that and it'll say, what's the purpose of this email is it a follow-up is it an offer is an initial contact stuff like that then it will generate kind of a gen a standard email and then from there once you you can kind of go back and forth with it and pick and choose like you can say mention the sales job or set a follow up for next week or something like that so it will kind of build an email off of what you're looking to do okay when I clicked on I guess the home page when it's signed in before I signed in it said PC Recruiter AI Suite. Is that what's new? Yep, that's what's new. And then introducing PCRM. What is that? PCRM is our new CRM package. And that's kind of another access point to PC Recruiter. It's like a newer interface, but it's also going to be a CRM package that adds a sales pipeline and also a simpler sequencing piece. I have never been able to set up a sales pipeline because it's too difficult for me because I find that there are so many, you know, the first thing you do is, you know, you start to prospect, you know, for a candidate. You know, you search for your candidates. Then, you know, you look at it. You know, I don't know how it's supposed to go. Like from a roll up, are you starting? And so I'm wondering, do you have some that are in place that could be used? And then like templates, because for me, this has really been a difficult task to narrow down. Because I might try to get in touch with somebody four or five times, either by text or voicemail. And then I just, you know, give up. They didn't call back. So I have...
