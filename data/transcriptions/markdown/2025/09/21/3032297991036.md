## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. We have an account with you, and I got a new computer, and the little pop-up thing doesn't come up anymore, so I can add somebody into the database. And I'm hoping you can just walk me through or log in or someone can to my computer and just fix it for me. Yeah, what pop-up thing are you referring to? Like if you're trying to add someone from like LinkedIn? No, like somebody sent me their resume. And if I click on, you know, the little lightning bolt and then I click on name and then go to paraphrase from resume, hit start. There used to be this then another pop up that would come up so I could do it. Well, now it's not there. Yep. So what you'll need to do is download Java and the launcher. that's what controls that pop-up. That's a good email address for you. I can send you over both those links here to get those downloaded. And I use a Mac. I don't know if that makes a difference on which one you send me. It does, so thank you for letting me know. Yeah. So, Jesse, J-E-S-S-E at thechasteengroup.com And Chasteen is spelled C-H-A-S as in Sam, T as in Tom, E-E-N as in Nancy. Perfect. All right. All right. Let me grab those links here for you. Thank you. And do I download both? Yes. Okay. Yeah, you'll download the Java first and then the launcher. Okay, cool. Let me grab these. You don't need the PC ones because you're on a Mac. All right. I just sent those on over to you. Okay, perfect. Yep, and once you get those downloaded, just log out and back into PC Recruiter. It'll ask you to run an update for the launcher. You'll just allow that to happen, and then that'll start working for you. Okay, perfect. I appreciate it. Thank you. Not a problem. And if you run into any issues, just give us a call back. Okay, appreciate it. Yep. Have a great day. You too. Bye. Bye....
