## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Rick Wolf. Hi. Hi. Nice to speak with you. I seem to be screwed up here with my PCR. Can we do a session? I'm having problems creating contacts. I don't know whether it's me or whether it's my computer or what. Could you do a session with me, please? Yeah. Hold on one second. You guys changed your greeting around with the call options. Oh, really? Yeah, I haven't even noticed. I don't call in. I'm on the receiving end. Let's see here. Yeah. Do you have RingCentral? No, I don't. Okay. So what I'll do is a Google Meet. Okay. Are you going to send me a link for you to that? Yeah. Yeah, hold on one second. And then before we go away, I also need to talk to you about your new AI offering and how you tap into that. Yeah, you'll have some of it already. The AI search we can't just apply because you have to have, some of our customers are still on loose keyword version too, so it has to be on loose scene for us to enable it. Okay. I'd have to first verify if that's. Yeah. Let's see. Rick.Wolf at ME.com. Is that correct? That's it. That's correct. Email the link. and then when you get in turn off your microphone otherwise you'll get a lot of feedback okay okay so what database do you use is it top 300 isn't that the one you use yeah top 300 right and I see if I can enable this for you your top 300 database Yeah, you would have to be re-indexed first. Okay. So use top 300. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and kind of add it, but it won't work yet until we re-index your database. It has to be on what's called a scene, which is a more robust indexing method. Okay. We're going to have to read, which you actually might like anyway, because it also will probably be faster. Mm-hmm. Enable AI search. Is that a press the button and come back tomorrow kind of thing? Well, I have the code in there, but, yeah, they have to kick off a reindex of your database. Okay. One thing that will be nice is it will probably be faster. It's like the search method. Like any newer customers, they're getting this Lucene already, but any previous database. Okay, so let's see. AI search has been enabled, but need to have database indexed as Lucene. Okay. Database is top 300, and then we called it top 300. Top 300. Okay. AI search. Serial code added. Will they send me a message when that happens? Yeah. They will. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All righty. Okay, so did you get the link that I sent you? Yeah, so do you want people to see and hear you in the meeting and it's got a picture? has the blue allow microphone and camera and then it's got a microphone with a line through it and the camera with the line through it. Okay. Yeah, you can join with that. We don't need microphone or camera. I just need you in the meeting. Yeah, she's got to join. Just ask to join? Yeah. Okay. Okay. All right, there you are. Okay. Okay. Hold on one second. Enable. Okay. So what's your issue then? Let's see what's going on here. At the bottom of your screen, you should see a square, I'm sorry, rectangle with an arrow that's your share screen option click that no I clicked at the bottom of your of your Google me screen okay I need to figure this out okay there you are again and allow is that the computer with the arrow in it Yeah. Yeah. Sure screen. Okay. We're starting. Maybe first, could you just go through my user thing and make sure I've got everything set up properly? I use the like to make a contact I load the VCF card and then I do download and sync I guess it is so you're talking about portal? yeah I can't see your screen so when you hit share screen go over to entire screen Oh, okay. Yeah. Entire screen. Okay. Here. I clicked on his Microsoft Edge tab window and entire screen. So I clicked on entire screen and there's a blue line underneath it. And then I have to click on the screen. Yeah, I got to pick which screen to show. right and then I click share okay all right so are you on now okay so if you go over yeah go over so keep this meeting screen open so we're just good but we're going to minimize that we just don't want to close it otherwise you're going to be kicked out of the meeting. OK. Minimize. Yeah, just minimize the meeting. Where do I do that, Robin? At the top right of your browser. OK. So it's still like, yep, yeah, it's that one. OK. And then you can hit where it says meet.google.com is sharing your screen. hit hide at the bottom there okay okay so now so if you're trying to use a portal feature you got to be in your outlook okay go over to your outlook yeah that's it there no no there so can you go over to your main email tab because I think are you in this like they're kind of like their new version are you in your Outlook classic that's what I was just yeah you have to be in the Outlook classic do a window search for the word Outlook so at the very bottom of your computer.
