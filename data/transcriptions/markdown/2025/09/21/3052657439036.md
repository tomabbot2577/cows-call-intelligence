## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Heather, and I'm with EGRIT Consulting. How are you today, Heather? Good. How are you? Doing good. Doing good. Good. I have a question for you. I don't know the best way to explain it, so I'm just going to try, because I don't know how much research you guys can do to see why this happened. But we had a bulk email go out. This is the first time we know of this happening. So we had both emails go out, and one of the people that got the email happened to email back just saying that he wasn't interested. But let us know that when the letter went out, the field where it should have added his name saved the code. So it had name.first slash name. Yeah, let me take a look here. What's your username for the database? Hold on. And the thing is that the letter itself has been altered, so that's why I don't think you can test it. It was Patty that actually did that, and she's messed around with the actual letter. Yeah, I can look at the old campaign, though, and take a look at it. Oh, okay, cool. I'm guessing that someone didn't put the insert field in correctly. If I had to make an educated guess. That's what we looked at. Okay, we'll just start and see where you've been. So I'm, my username is HXK. All right. Now you know what the campaign is. Again, it's under PADI. Oh, it looks like they said this. Which roll-up list did this go out to? Hold on. Let me find it. I'm going back through all the email. And which database was this in? The regular? The Mundelein one. Ah, that would be why I wasn't seeing it. Yeah, so the roll-up. okay so the roll up was 5418 RFM Western created by PXK alright and it was did it go out today no it went out Tuesday on the 12th okay perfect let me take a look at this ah yep i see it in the coding here so with those insert fields if you're like copying and pasting them okay it can cause issues where form like say you copied it into word and then repasted it into a form letter okay word could add extra coding to the insert field which causes it not to read right so when you're doing copy paste you either need to paste it as plain text or just redo the insert field inside the form letter after pasting it in. Gotcha, okay so does it look like everybody ended up with it looking like that? Let me take a look at some of these people. Thank you. Let me check this. just trying to see if I can see the emails. And how do you do that where you can actually see what it looked like? So if they have a mail server set up correctly, they usually get put in the sent items folder. Okay. But this user does not. Oh, and it's going through Mailgun. Right. Yeah. that's why I kind of figured we couldn't stick it on our end but how did you look to see that the coding was wrong I'm trying to see if it was something I could have done or not not if you knew what you were looking for I went I went to the letter itself like in the campaign send and like the back one passed and inspected the page and that's what I was trying to do because that's where I thought it might be and I wasn't able to play with that. Okay. So I'll let her know. So she might have copied and pasted and then it messed up the coding. Yeah. I always say it's just safe to just hit insert field. Insert field. Okay. All right. I'll let her know that. Okay, well, that helps a lot. At least we know, we're trying to figure out if it was something, you know, it's not anything we saw happen before, so it's, you know, those weird things. Yeah, it usually happens when you're copying and pasting from Word. Okay. Just because Microsoft Word has its own, like, formatting. Right. Like, different text files. Okay, and that makes sense to me. All right, great. Well, thank you so much. that helps a lot yep not a problem you have yourself a great day you too thanks so much bye...
