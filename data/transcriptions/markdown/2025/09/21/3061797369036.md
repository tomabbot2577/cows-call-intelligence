## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, my name is Nathan. I'm with Iris Recruiting. For one of our users, they're having an issue when they try to use the send a form letter. They have their email entered in the from email section, and that is the email that's tied to the account. But whenever they try to send it, it goes from the admin one. Or, yeah, from the system administrator account. All right, let me pop in and take a look. Which database are they logging into? This is going to be Specialty Trades. And if you need the ODBC, let me know. It's the MR Indianapolis North, correct? Yeah, yeah, you got it. And what is their username? NMW. And the specific form letter name if you need that is the I just tried you again. How are they sending the form letter? Like are they going to a name record? Yeah. And clicking the form letter next to the email? Yeah. And their email is the NY is at? Iris Recruiting, yeah. That's the one it should be sending from, but it looks like it's going from the info at Iris Recruiting. And they're sending it directly from the name record, you said, correct? It's not like an automation through a roll-up list? Yeah. All right. I'm going to pop myself in here as a test record real quick just so I can take a look. Okay. Thank you. Yep. All right. I should get that email here in just a second. No, I just did it directly from the name record, and it came over as NYs. Okay, got it. Let me have them test again, and I guess I'll see if they're using some different format. But yeah, they said that's how they were doing it. So let me have them test again, and I'll reach back out if there's any issues. Yeah, let me just double check here. because they do have some automations in their roll-up list setup, and I'm guessing that could be it. Okay. Let me take a look at that here real quick. I think I see the issue. Yes. So it looks like here let me try this yeah it looks like it might be an automation in their roll-up list that's causing the issue okay so let's give this a try yep that's what's causing it because I just there's a specific stage in his roll-up list layout that sends that form letter but the automation shot you set correctly but I can fix that in two seconds So let's try this again. Yep, that fixed it. So yeah, have the user try it again the way that they were doing it. But both ways should come from end wise now through the roll-up list and just sending the form letter directly from the name record. Perfect. Thank you so much. I'll have them test that out and I'll let you know if there's any other issues. Yep. Yeah. And if I, here, I'll give you my direct line in case you run into any issues. That way you don't have to play hokey pokey, trying to get someone back on. Oh, perfect. My direct line is 440-772-0670. 0670. Perfect. Thank you so much again for your help and hopefully you get to have a great weekend. You as well. alright bye bye...
