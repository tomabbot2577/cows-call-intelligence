## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSegret Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hey, how's it going? This is Omar. I'm calling in regards to a trouble ticket that was put in from Brian Denton. Alright, one second. Let me put some information down. Can you pull up that ticket? Yes, give me one moment. I'm sifting through my emails here trying to, because I just got copied in on it. It's looking like ticket, I'm going to click on this, 101302. all right yeah i see it's titled remove opt out bounce yes okay let me read through here let me skim through here unless you want to catch me up yeah i mean essentially uh brian's working with someone who on their database they have about 99 bounced emails and he's just trying to delete them off, but he doesn't want to do them one at a time. And we were just wondering if there was like a process of if it was possible from you guys, y'all being the admins, or if there was a method where we could just, you know, select all, delete. You'd like to remove emails off of the opt-out list in mass? yes yes it's looking like there was an Excel sheet I'm looking at I'm not in the database myself I was just kind of delegated this task and yeah there's about 98 emails from C Braun CB are a UN with the database it is database Four Season Talent Partners, LLC. Let me take a look at this. I think I understand what you said. um I'm sorry. I'm logging into the four season talent partners right now. I see Braun. I'm looking at the opt out list. I appreciate it. So, is, hold on, let me re-read the, what is, Garrett has been the person you've been working with. All bounces. So you want to remove all bounces from the opt-out list. Is that what I'm... Yes. Yes, please, if you could. If there's a way that we could do it on our end, that isn't just individually just clicking the individual email and hitting delete. That would also be very cool. interesting okay um Garrett was not able to perform like certain tasks like this so he asked another colleague of ours to take a look and they just haven't yet looking at the note like the private notes um she's very busy so that makes sense and i'm not sure why he didn't ask me i'd be the one to do this type of thing actually uh the thing is though i'm not sure if there's like a process for this because the email opt-in opt-out list is um i guess there for like a specific reason i'm not sure if we'd I mean, I guess it's your data, but yeah. Yeah, she was just – I guess the user of that database got a bunch of bounced emails, and she was just trying to delete them so that she wouldn't be able to email them ever again, I guess. That makes sense, right? I just got delegated this task. I apologize for not being fully informed on the matter. Hmm. Well, so, yeah, I don't think that what you just said doesn't really line up with what I was interpreting before. Okay, so if that's the case, you can please disregard what I'm saying because I clearly don't know what I'm talking about. I always just delegated this task to ensure that there was no issues with whatever Brian Denton was requesting to be facilitated, either by me, by you giving me instructions, or if it was going to be able to be done by you guys as a whole. Hold on. Maybe – Yeah, so it says – Maybe we both – Yeah. Yeah, so reading the initial ticket, it's like if someone got blocked by Microsoft when they sent out a sequence and those emails bounced back and were added to the opt-out list, how can I remove them easily instead of 500 at a time, as in removing the emails en masse versus just individually deleting the... so okay i think that okay okay okay okay i think i've had been like reading red herrings this whole time and now you're now you're explaining it in a different way and i'm thinking this this whole time the way he chose to word it kind of confused us on our end and so okay so when you say delete them you mean go to the name remove their email and save their name again without an email so that they can't be emailed again you don't yeah yeah oh okay i think the entire time garrett and robin uh thought you wanted to remove them from the opt-in slash opt-out list and there's like private messages where garrett's like how do you remove from the opt-in opt-out list and then there's like another tech giving like an example of like where those are stored and what potential query they could... So I think they're confused, and now you're explaining it differently. So that's helpful, at least. We can clarify that. Yeah, I mean, it just seems like the emails that she sent out bounced back because they were unwanted. So the task at hand here is like, okay, let's delete these email addresses so that I don't email them anymore and I don't get bounced back and I'm not bothering them and I'm not getting hit for spamming people that are opted out of receiving my emails. Okay. That's a much different task than what we were thinking you needed. So let me see. Can you roll people up off of this list? Yeah...
