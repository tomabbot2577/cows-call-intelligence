## 💬 Full Transcript

 James Cairns. Hi, James. This is Robin Mantoni. How are you? Hey, I'm great, Robin. How are you doing? Oh, pretty good. So I see you have a card ending in 7540 turned on for auto pay. Is that still the card that you need to use? No, it got hacked, so I had to get a new one. Okay. I just sent you an email because I can't delete the card, and I think it's better to just delete it. I can't delete the card. But I just sent you an email. Okay, so I go through the portal, though. Yeah, so have you signed up through this portal yet? Like, created an account for it yet? Okay. I don't think so. So I'll walk you through that. So the email that you just got, what you'll have to do is click create an account or sign up. Yeah. And then. Okay, let's see, sign up. Okay, so I'll let you go through that process. Oh, it already exists. Okay. All right. Okay, so go ahead and sign in. All right. Let me – give me one second. I've got to open my password list. 300 passwords in it. Yeah, this one, it doesn't use your PCR password because somebody that's doing billing may not even be a PCR user. Plus, that would be insecure. Yeah. It's an external site. Okay. Let me – If you try to put your email address in, does it like maybe try to prompt you what your password is? Maybe if you had your browser save it? Yeah, sorry, hold on one second, I'm sorry. That's okay. Okay, so let's see. It just says username already exists, please log in. So let me see if this, I guess maybe I have to... In Val log in attempt so forgot password just this Here we go. Okay. Now that works. Now I've got to log in. Okay. All right, cool. All right, so I'm in. So I can just adjust it here, huh? Yeah. Now, because you have, what you'll want to do is probably add the new card. And then turn on, like you'll have to like toggle the auto pay option for the existing before you can delete the existing one that you already have in 7540. If you have it on for auto pay, it doesn't let you delete it because it's on for auto pay. Got it. so I just need to take it off of auto pay like temporarily and then go back and redo it yeah so if you if you take it off auto pay and hit save okay here I'm just putting a new one in um yeah so at the bottom of this it says enable auto pay for future transactions when I add the new card you're saying don't do that now no go ahead and try that okay i i think it'll turn the other one off then but we'll make sure okay got it so learning all the nuances myself okay so once the auto pay is off for 75 40 you should see it listed over at like the left a little bit and then you to be able to delete that card since you're no longer using it. Okay. So payment method. All right. What is this? Oh, select. I just don't know what it says. It's like, there's a, there's like this invoices that show up and it says like invoice number. And then all the way to the right, it says select a, like that's but it's like the text is cut off. Does that mean auto-pick? I don't know. Are you zoomed in maybe? Maybe that's what's cut off. Let me see. It's just the way that it's Are you in the vault area? Yeah. I think so. Let's see. It says Invoices History Profile Vault. Yeah, click on Vault. But that's all at the top. Okay, yeah, click vault. Because that's where you manage your payment methods. Got it. I see. All right, cool. Yeah, I can just, okay, so I think what I'll, okay, this all makes sense. Let me ask you this. When was this last invoice I got? So I reached out to Jim, Jim Wise and whoever, or somebody else, but it was, we just asked to cancel that kind of service. It was like the AI and sequencing feature. We just weren't using it. So when was the, can you tell me when the last one, those is, and is this bill that was due the 15th? Is that for like the following month or make sure the cutoff is right? Hold on one second. Let's see. Okay. This one is for premium and AI, and that was dated 7-15. Let me see if they just changed it for you. Will you change it maybe for your next one? Oh, okay. Did he create a ticket? Let me see. I don't see an adjustment here. Let's see. You just have to change the contract first. Let's see. Anytime. Okay. I don't see anything. When did you reach out? I don't know, probably a month ago. To Jim Lombardo? Jim Wise and then he forwarded it to somebody else yeah that would probably be Jim Lombardo I would assume I don't see anything for removing AI in here yet Jim is on vacation this week but he will be back Monday alright let me see so he said did he send you a new agreement or something? Email received. Yes, still two users. Okay. Well, that was just on the 25th. Okay. 22nd. Yeah. He said, thanks for, he said, I can get you to move back to the enterprise version at your old rates and drop all the premium features from your account. You're still two users, correct? Okay. Please confirm that user number as well as confirm the correct address. Once I get back from you, I'll let you know. I'll get it. I'll send a new contract for...
