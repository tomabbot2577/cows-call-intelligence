## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Laura. Hi, Laura. This is Jason calling from Main Sequence Technologies. I got your voicemail. I just wanted to follow up with you. Oh, thank you. Do you have a time to take a look at our account? I guess some of my people have called because their email isn't recording and there was something about figuring out. I don't know. I don't even really know. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'm not having problems with my email, but my employees cannot seem to get them to record. And I guess they've struggled to connect with somebody in customer service or PCS support. And so I just said I would see if it was a, I don't know, some sort of setup with their company. But then I checked my emails are still recording. So I just don't know how to solve it. Yeah, yeah. So it would be an individual basis. So honestly, having them individually call support is probably the best way to handle it or individually put in tickets because it is going to be like a case-by-case basis with each user. So they were asking if there was like a – what was it? They were asking what kind of email setup we have with like some SMTP or IM, I don't know. Do you have any idea what I'm talking about? So there's two different ways that emails are recorded inside of PCR. There's SMTP relay, which is recording the sent emails, and IMAP, which is recording the incoming emails. I think if they were asking a question, it would be who hosts your email. And that would be like Microsoft or Google or GoDaddy, like whoever. I believe it's Go. I can never remember. Well, sometimes it's easier to ask, like when you're accessing your email, where do you go through? Is it like Outlook? Do you go through Google? I go through Outlook, but not everybody. I have a Google email address that goes through Outlook. So I think it's called Google Workspace, maybe. Okay. So in most cases, do you guys use the PCR Outlook portal? Oh, I'm sorry. I don't know what that is. Yeah, you wouldn't know if you're using it. It's inside of, like, the Outlook app on your computer. It puts a version of PCR in it. Yes, I am using that. The problem is that some of my people have Apple computers, and so it's more confusing. And so I don't really know how all that crap works. Yeah. Do you want me to – I can put together an email and send it over to you that just kind of has some information breaking down the different use cases because Apple computers are going to handle it a little differently. Yeah, absolutely. Anything you can do to help would be amazing because if you haven't figured it out, we're all a bunch of morons in this area. We're on our strengths. And I'm not going to lie to you. I'm super irritated that my people can't figure it out. So I just need them to figure it out so that I can go back to working. Okay. Is your email – sorry if I put your last name. No, no problem. It's Ruchi. It doesn't matter. At Ascendant Attorney Search. Okay, perfect. I'll get an email put together kind of covering some different use cases, what they are. And if you just want to forward that to your people, they should be able to figure it out from that piece of things. Should be in the operative word here. Yeah. Okay. But yes, that would be a great start. Are you there? Oh, no. Hello? Laura, can you still hear me? My headset messed up. Hello? Are you able to hear me? My headset messed up. Oh, no. Yeah, I can now. I couldn't before. Okay. Yeah. So give me like five, 10 minutes and I'll send an email over to you with just kind of like the resources. And all else fails, just have them reach out to PCR support because this is like a relatively common issue. Anyone at PCR should be able to help you. Okay, great. They've tried and they haven't been able to. So let's hope your stuff works because otherwise I don't really know. I got you. Yeah. Okay. I've got that sent over to you. Yeah, yeah, we'll get it tackled from there, but I got that all sent over to you now. All right. Thank you. Take care. Yep, absolutely. Bye....
