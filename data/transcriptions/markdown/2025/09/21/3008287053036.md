## 💬 Full Transcript

 Robin. No, I'm not calling those people's tech teams. I'm not doing it. You're not doing what? No, I'm not calling those people. David Reese. I don't care if you're technically stupid. You don't pay us any monthly fees. I'm not calling your tech team to tell them how to maintain their Office 365 account. I told them, show them this screen. how it's it was like some message that it's basically locked down by the system administrator over there probably oh so there's nothing wrong it's just they need to have their tech team do it not us from what i remember because i did a screen share with my mom go that's something i don't see you'll need to talk to your tech team they seem to have it locked down he could talk to his tech team they don't pay us any monthly fees i'm not doing it i'm not i got no i'm not doing it just because they don't want to yeah I don't understand them yeah you want to maintain your database on your servers you don't pay any monthly fees you got apparently restrictions on your office 365 account they're stupid I guess their guy got all mad and he wrote in the ticket well I don't know what kind of support they're paying they don't pay for support that's why we didn't give them support. I'm like, did anybody tell them that? The guy's all upset. I don't know if Nick clearly told him, no, you don't have support. That's why we don't give support. They don't pay us for support. There is no support contract. It's not even a PCR issue. You must have their Office 365 accounts locked down, preventing a sign-on, like an OOP. I don't remember this message specifically. I think I sent him a screenshot, if I remember right. Let me see if I even have anything like that saved or anything. it's not it does not seem to be pcr related if it is it's because you're on such an old damn version and that's the only reason why or you have it so locked down but that's all on you and when did i talk to him I don't even know what it was the ticket's in there authentication unsuccessful user credentials I think there was a talk with David Reese okay from the dead page person that I spoke with about cloud that a few what's the other ticket then I think it's under like David Brenner or Drenner or Drebbins or something weird like that. Oh, my ticket, I talked to one of them. I think it was with David. No, I'm not chasing down their support people. It's not fast. And what's this other one about? Oh, here, this one. The user session context is missing. One or more of the user's context values were not supplied. Every request must include these values and maintain them across a single composer work bar. We're unable to get the app password to bypass it. Well, I'll sign in. He's going to reach out. Oh, I told him to reach out to see if they can help him create an app-specific password because we weren't even allowed to do that. That's what I told him to do. so he's got to do that because he's like oh it never got fixed well because he didn't do what he had to do right we weren't able to do the sign-in so I said well we could try like an app specific password because there was these like correlations like I don't even know what this means invalid request the user session context is missing if you look at one zero zero 40467. My last two notes. And I even told him what to do seven days ago. Hi, David. Pre-request. Here's what to ask your tech person. How to create an app-specific password for your Office 365 email account. We can then try using the password it generates instead of using the sign-in OAuth method. I literally told him what to ask them. He can fuck off. Yeah, he just told me, oh, that still has to fix. I don't know what happened. I don't understand those people. We're trying to get them to go ASP because they have no business hosting themselves, but business is down. I don't know that they're going to do it. Can you hear me now? I do now. Okay, great. There's a short in this cord somewhere and it keeps messing me up. Yeah, I literally wrote him an email after the thing saying, here's what the Astro Tech person said. You didn't do it. I'm out. I'm not going to keep wasting time for someone who doesn't even pay you. And I'm not calling their support person. How do you do it? Get your app to Westbrook and then I'll show you where to put it in. That's all I'm doing. I'll just rehash to him what you said and say that this is what you have to do. That's what it is. We can't help anymore. Yeah. If it's not accepting a sign-in method, which might even be like a setting on there, maybe they don't let people sign into their office 365. I don't know. It could be a setting. That's for the tech person to answer. What we can try is an app-specific password and go from there. I still don't even know if that will work, but it might. But that's what he'll need to try next. Nuts. I'm not kidding. because I mean not and then and they don't want to pay oh it's too expensive because your guys are a bunch of losers probably and do r...
