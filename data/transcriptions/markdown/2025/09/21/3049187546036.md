## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. How are you today? Good. How are you? Good. Thanks. Can you help me with my database? Just scrub it up and fix a couple of things. Yeah. What's going on? Nothing really. Nobody's using PCR. That's a concern as an owner. But I'll try to change all that if I can. So the company is Pinnacle Search. let's start with that because i've got three different sub we have actually a total of four databases we have our primary pinnacle search that's where everybody's probably listed how many let's i just need a couple of questions here how many users do we have that we pay monthly four at the time. I'm guessing it's five. Yes. Five. It is five? How many people have logged into PCR in the last month? Let me check. I'm trying to get a gauge on usage here, right? Okay. Taking a look at the different usernames here. Well, that's going to be my next question because I don't even see that in my portal. Yeah, so you can check this in the logging options in the database. Well, let me write that down because I'm in the database right now. How do I go to the login options? So I typically just go to system and then in the little search bar in the system, system, you can just start typing login. There's logging option and user logins. That takes you both to the same screen. Well, I typed in login. Is that one word or two? Yeah, logging. L-O-G-G. L-O-G-G. R-N-G. Logging. Yep. User logins. Look at that. and then you not showing me anything well and then once you click it down at the bottom you'll see where it says begin date end date that's where you can set your date range your log action which you can select from the list like the log on okay well i'm on i'm on begin date so i'm going to put oh so 101 we'll go to the beginning of the year. A 101, I guess, to current. And then how do you action that? Because it doesn't actually give you an action. Up in the top right of that bottom half of the screen, there's an options menu and then you'll see the search in there. Yeah, I see it. It's not pinned. That's why. Okay. Search. There we go. Okay. There we go. That's useful. Looks like Rene Greener. Me. All right. Tannen used it once. Yeah, it'll have it broken down by day as well over on the right. Yeah, it looks like... Yeah, it's not a lot of use, is it? Okay. Yeah, I'm seeing a few others from last month, like Connor logged in once. Scott a few times last month. yeah all right yeah they're not using the database all right so I first of all like let me just I need to get access to who were all the users are the first thing and so I'm in the users tab now mm-hmm I'm just gonna go back to the beginning because it only showed it shows two users under the under my system which obviously is not correct right well so each list is broken down database specific so depending on which database you log into that user list may be different all right so for the main pinnacle search one there's two users I believe right so I'm in the pinnacle search one right now and I see eight eight usernames in there. And I see two. All right. So you might want to hear, try logging out, just hit the refresh button. All right. Log out. Yeah. And then that top part before you put in a username and password, we'll show you which database you're logging into. Which database? Yeah, I know about that. Yeah. So I'm logging into the pinnacle search one. And it says there's, when I go up to the system gear icon in the top left, I have two users in there. The number two. Now, when I open that, I have one, two, three, four, five, six. I have eight. Yeah, so that two next to users, that means how many options are in that menu when you click on that spot. Okay, gotcha. All right. All right. So we've got Ankita. We've got Craig Riley. Are they both showing as active? Because we need to delete them. They don't use the system. Let me see. We have HireTool. No clue what that is. We have something named Swappy. Don't know what that is. Are you using SourceWale? Nope. We did at one point. Okay. So that's their API user. That's fine. So what you can always do is you can click on a username in that list. Yeah. and then it'll open there like security options down at the, on the bottom half, you can click that lock icon at security. Now scroll all the way down to the bottom to the security policy section. And you can always check the account is disabled option and then hit save if it's not an active account. All right. So that's, and then will that remove it from the system then? They'll still show in that list. just because it makes it easier to do certain things like search roll-up lists by user, but then they won't be able to access the system because it's a disabled account. Yeah, it's disabled. Like half of these users aren't around. Okay, so that's good. I have set up two sub things as well. What am I trying to say? Subdatabases, Storyteller. I'm eating another coffee here. So the and...
