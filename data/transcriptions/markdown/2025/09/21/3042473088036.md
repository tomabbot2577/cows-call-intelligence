## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is Bill. Hi, Bill. It's Robin Mantoni. How are you? Hey, Robin. I'm doing fine. How are you? Oh, pretty good. That's kind of odd. Good. So I looked up your account. I'm not really sure why I didn't process that. Okay. Let's see. I'll go in. Updated 7-27. Maybe that's AFTA. Because I remember I got your email about you were switching billing companies, I guess. Yeah. And I went in and did it the last time. with that. And I thought that was going to take care of it to set it up for auto. I wonder if there's a little bit of a conflict because it says updated 727, which is the same date as your thing. What maybe it just didn't process when it was currently open. Like you did it. But it does say that it is enabled and I can like literally with a click of a button process it for you. Okay. Yeah. Cause I did that for the June one. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. So I think there, I have a feeling there's a little bit of a timing thing. Okay. That if you maybe enabled the auto pay right after or before, like maybe it doesn't apply, but then the next ones it goes. So I just ran it. Let me make sure it went through transactions. It takes a moment here. Yeah, I just make sure I check my card to make sure the expiration date was good and it's good through the 2030, so that wasn't the issue. I know a lot of times that happens. Yeah, I don't see that. 86-71 is ending card on the due date, and that due date was the 27th. yeah it sounds like it well it kind of goes through like like one thing and then it goes to one and it slows back i believe is what's going on right something is a little more automated than when it used to be right too many customers be doing things the old way I hear you which is a good thing right right yeah it's a good thing you're bringing them in still I know there's a lot of competition out there for what these companies are doing your company everybody's trying to sell you cancel all your applicant tracking systems and let us show you how AI can help you place more people. Yeah. Okay. Didn't somebody get sued for AI hiring? I don't know. I don't know if it was a software company or the company. No, I feel like it was a full learning. No, I don't know. Somebody had thought that. That would make sense. Some kind of news. you know yeah like instead of like you know just really just doing AI to do hiring you know well it's a dangerous yeah well it doesn't tell you it doesn't it doesn't get it doesn't create the relationship unfortunately exactly right yeah like oh I have these words but if somebody else words it differently right yeah that's not the same as talking to them Nope. Okay. Why is this still showing as open? It's like it didn't even try to crash us. That's bizarre. Can you call me back? I have a 130. I'm actually... Yeah, go, go, go. I get it. If you get back to me, that would be great, or I can call you back. All right. Thanks, Robin. Yeah, give me a call back when you have a moment, okay? What's your extension, or is it billing? 5466 is my extension. 5466. Okay, will do. Thanks. Okay, thanks. Bye. Bye. Mm-hmm. Wait to see this. Okay. Thank you....
