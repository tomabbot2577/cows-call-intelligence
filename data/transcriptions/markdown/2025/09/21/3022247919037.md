 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. you are in the meeting now there are two participants in the meeting this meeting is being recorded good morning this is jim jim hey wayne miller good morning good morning how are you i am well doing well i have my associate vanessa coming in she she used it on pc more more than I do now, so I figured I'd let her come in and take a look. She's on there. So I'll leave it up to you to show us the way. Excellent, excellent. So we're looking at the PCRM piece today. Is that right? Yes. Excellent, excellent. So a little background around the PCRM. I'm going to share my screen here. You should have a sign-in screen showing up momentarily. But this was originally conceived as kind of a replacement invoice for an invoice a replacement interface for PCR 9 when it was conceived several years back so it was going to replace PCR 9 so they started development in that capacity but then as they moved on and started developing it they added some additional CRM functionality naming leave deals pipeline a simpler sequencing piece and that combined with the new interface at the beginning of this year it was decided that it was going to be launched as a separate side-by-side product for PCRecruiter but it shares the same database as PCRecruiter so what that does is that gives you the unique ability to utilize either PCRM or PCR9 so you're going to have the ability to use either or both because it's not a conversion per se so if you added PCRM it doesn't change or affect or turn off your your existing PCRecruiter but you'd have full access to this new interface so it's going to have just about everything that the PCR 9 has the one thing it was lacking for a while was searching but that has been improved and is continuing to be improved so that's going to be a little bit of a help now so I want to show you around kind of what the new interface looks like as we go through so do you see my sign in you see the screen okay I do I do so just to confirm so you could any given time you could log into PCR 9 or log into PCRM simultaneously and the data would be updated both on both sides basically real real time both ways yes okay all right yeah so a lot of people like that being able to use both so I'm going to go and get myself logged into my database here and kind of the biggest thing you'll notice when you get into PCRM is going to be everything is kind of not top to bottom anymore like the current PC recruiter it's more left to right so you're going to have a dashboard screen of different widgets you can configure so you can kind of pick and choose all these different widgets at the top and just drag one right down you're able to drag and drop them wherever you want them to be so a little easier to configure and the biggest thing down the left-hand side of the screen is going to be all of your typical buttons most of them are the same as the PC recruiter now name company position roll-ups so those are going to be the same terminology but they're down the left-hand side of the screen but they're going to look entirely different so if I went into for example names the name screen is going to take up the entire screen now it's going to show you your recently viewed records and we've read totally redesigned this this initial screen to give you the ability now you can edit in line if you ever needed to edit any of that data in line you can control what fields are going to show here sort by them if you wish you can even pin fields so if you have more than one field as you scroll over you can pick several of fields to pin and they won't scroll so it's a little bit more configurable user-friendly than the existing version of PCRecruiter and then you're also going to have this unique actions area over here where you can say I want to send them an email or a call or a text I want to add them to a roll-up or add an activity right from there so you can do a little bit more from this front screen to your recently active records you're also going to have a search at the top So if I wanted to look up someone I can type in first name, last name, it'll add these little tags here, these little chips. And then you're going to be able to search in that capacity. So you can add as many of these as you wish. You can X them out individually. And then you're also going to have your Boolean searching here if you wanted to go. Actually, it's an all content search. So you can search that and I can look up sales. And then I can search in that capacity. So that's going to give you the ability to keyword search the database. That has been, like I said, that has been improved. I want to take that chip out of there. So that has been improved. I don't think my version is yet displaying it, but it is going to show where the word is found. It's going to highlight the words that it found, show you how many different places it found them ...
