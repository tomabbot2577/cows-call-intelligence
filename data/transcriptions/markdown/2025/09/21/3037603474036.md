## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name's Ken Burnett. And I was just building a sequence. And it's a multi-step sequence. And then when I hit for, I then hit the button check for problems. And it comes up error step call name in the branch. Branch one main is currently unreachable. What does that mean? So that means that you have no condition in other branches that will lead to that call step. I thought I did. Well, here, I'll just go over it with you. The first step is a call. If I connect with somebody, it continues to the next step, which is to send them to a new roll up. And then once that condition is met, the candidate has completed the sequence. Then there's another call step where. So that's why. Because after connected, do you have any other conditions in that first call that skip past that adding to roll up step? Well, I put another call step in. I want, well, because when I call somebody, I may talk to them, I may leave a message, or there may be no answer, or there may be somebody I'm just deleting from the sequence. So in that, is it the A and D, B, D calls template? Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, A and D, B, D calls template. Yep. So in that first step, the only condition you have is connected. Yeah. And that leads to step two, where they get added to a roll-up, and then the sequence is complete, meaning they're done in the sequence. They're done, right. And then I thought I'd add the step, because what I want to do... Yes, so you need to add conditions to step one that would jump them to step three. Oh, okay. So I've got to add... Now, where do I put that? you click the little plus underneath the conditions. Okay, so should I hit the little plus under where it says connected, click, continue to next step? Yes. Okay, so I click that. And then what I want to put in is button, leave message, right? Yep. Okay. L-E-A-V-E leave message and the action I want to do is to go to yeah it would be jump to step step three okay which will be the next series of calls okay yep and you can even put a delay in there so if you wanted to put like a one day delay so that way they don't you don't call them again right away that day. You could just like wait a day to call them back. Yeah, well, there's a lot of people I'm going to be going through. So it will be a day anyway. Okay, so what I need to do is under, all right, so I got to rewrite this whole thing basically. So you'll just want to add that, have those two conditions for each one of your calls and you'll be good. There'll be a series of, I'll make three attempts. Okay, so here. Okay, so that's call one. And then I want to go to actually it would be step four. I want to go to. Because that that will step four is actually the second call. Then what's step three? Well, step three was a continuation of the first call because I thought because what I had done. I know what I did wrong, I think. Because if you're looking at it, it's connected. Go to the new roll-up list. They've completed it. And then I had step three. Well, I could just rename what step three is and redo it. Yeah, that's probably a better way. Yeah, so what you want to do is you can have those roll-ups after each call step that you want. but just like how you have those three left message, no answer removed from sequence under call three, you want all those to be housed under call one. Right. But like the left message, no answer. You'll want those to jump to the next call step rather than moving to the next step. Got it. Okay. I understand. That makes sense. Okay. Thank you. Yep. Not a problem. Take care....
