## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. I had a quick question. I'm using PCR's capture. And you can on LinkedIn. Let me see if I can do it again. When I'm clicking capture, it allows you to edit field configuration. But when I make edits, I can't keep them so that they remain. Oh, okay. So that same spot where you got into the edit field configuration, once you're in there, it turns to a save option. Do you have to hit save at the top right? I'm pressing save, but it's not. At the top right or at the bottom right, though? I think the top right. Okay. That should do it, then. Let's see. Here, it's still. Let me press save again. Let me go to a new one. Let's see what happens. Yeah, the talk rights don't work. But here, let me open a new one recently and see if that helps. All right, take two. Okay, that worked. I had like 10 LinkedIn's opened and I forgot I needed a brand new LinkedIn for it to reset. Oh, yeah. If you already had it open, that could be an issue too. But the other thing I've seen people do is when they go in there and they see like save or how it's labeled at the bottom, like you got to do the one at the top right. So for the ad activity, it's making me get the selector and it automatically always selects 12 a.m. Is there any way to get it just to put up the time I'm submitting it at every time? You know what? I haven't really used that one that much. Because the one thing I wish I'd had is, like, you know, do I want to put it on my schedule? Let's see. I don't think it picks up current date and time, if I remember right. I have to manually select it, which is annoying. But it's just there's a workaround. Because it's just an endless list that keeps recycling. Yeah. Now, what are you using it for? Like what kind of activity are you writing on there? Because some of these activities aren't going to be generated for you automatically. Like added or updated the record? No, I wanted to put down that I just, you know, I spoke with them, didn't connect with them or whatever. Gotcha. Okay. So do I have add activity in my setup right now? No, I do not. Let me add that in. Okay. Let me reload my page. And I am so sorry, I did not pull up your information. What is your name again? Michael Shuler. S-C-H? S-C-H-U-L-E-R. U-L-E-R. It's S-S-I. S-S-I. Okay. I got a bunch of Michael Schillers. Used to be at Spectrum, so you might have an old profile. Oh, you know what? Wait. Oh, I think I did just have that. Sorry, hold on one second. Let's see. Okay. So you said it is part of Spectrum? Is that right? Okay. No, no, that was my old company. Oh. I'm just saying, both were on PCR. Oh, okay. Well, that makes it a little bit easier for you, right? Mm-hmm. How do we have... Is there, like, a long name for SSI? trying to remember uh super systems okay yeah that sounds similar okay there we go put you in here And what's your email address with this company now? mschuler at supersystemsinc.com. Okay. All right. I think this is the one. Perfect. In the capture stage, is there anything else you recommend adding these fields that you find your people save a lot of time with? I really like the add note. So if you just want to kind of add a note, like, oh, here's something I want to know about them, or just kind of point out when I'm looking at notes, that's a really good one. The add to roll up and link to position. Those are used more often than the add activity, to be honest. Let's see. And then also that there's other fields. You don't want to put anything under overview unless it's – Overview stuff's all automatic, right? Yeah, and it's required. So you can go in – actually, you know what? An only administrator can, so you probably can't configure that part. But like I said, there's maybe like custom fields or some other fields. You can make other field groups or pick fields that go into an existing field group. so it may not pull the data but at least you could populate it as you're creating the record but the add to roll up link to position are pretty good yeah i'm seeing it doesn't pick anything okay well i didn't even know that you could edit fields i wish i knew that at the last jump it's a huge um time saver just inside of the capture yeah like if you because a lot of people are asking for things like well i want to put it in like their industry for example and then that way you can just do it at the time that you're bringing it in. Real quickly, I used to get notifications when I captured someone on my desktop that would then take me like if I clicked on it, it would pull up their profile on PCR. I no longer get those. I was messing around with my settings. It could be that you don't have your Chrome notifications enabled. Okay, let me see. It's like if you're like on Windows if you go to notifications? Yeah, I'm on Chrome. Let me try settings. No, not settings. Maybe this. Accessibility? No. Let's see. Usually if you go to, let's see. I feel like all these different versions of Windows are a lit...
