## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, this is Jim. Hey Jim, how are you? I am well, how are you? I'm good. I'm good. Sorry that I'm a little late. I needed to install Zoom, but we've done it, I guess. No problem at all. No problem at all. Glad we could connect. So I wanted to kind of just learn a little bit about what you're looking for, what you're using now, what your needs are, and I can show you around as well. Cool, cool, cool. I can't see you, Jim, by the way. Is that... Oh, you know what? You don't need to, but I'll turn it on. I usually don't have my camera on. I just keep it off. I'm usually looking down, taking notes, or showing the screen or whatever, so I don't usually have it on. But I have nothing on. No worries. For sure. So the reason I reached out to you is to give you a little bit of background. I'm from CV Transformer. So we're not a recruitment agency, but we are an AI software tool which we integrate with ATS systems. What we do is we automate CV formatting. And I thought I said that when I reached out. So we're currently integrated with Greenhouse JobAdder 720 and we're working on some more integrations. And I was just curious to see who your clients are and not necessarily names, but are they like recruitment agencies or are they a different type of agencies and is there some synergy in which we might be able to collaborate with partnership integration whatsoever okay for sure for sure yeah so we uh we have about about 2,000 customers using PC recruiter the majority of them are going to be recruiting agencies both temp and perm retained kind of all sorts also some corporations doing internal recruiting as well but to a lesser extent those so nice okay that is great and are you guys and is it all custom build or are you build like on sales force for example or something else I know we are totally custom-built so we have been around since the late 90s custom-built program we kind of do all of our own updates our our own software builds it's quite configurable to the user so they can customize the screens, add different fields, do a lot of configuration in the system there. But yeah, we are our own system. We do all development in-house here. Nice, nice, nice. Sounds good. Because did you know that I was calling from CV Transformer trying to talk about an integration or did you think that I was a recruitment agency trying to use your software? I didn't know. I assume you were an agency, but this happens oftentimes, people calling in to talk about integrations or anything like that. So it happens. Okay, okay, okay, good, good. I'll roll either way. But, yeah, so is it something that you write the integration? I don't know if it would be something we'd be open to. I do have a different person who kind of works with our integrations who might be good to put you in touch with. I guess that might be the best way then. Because as I said, we've started last year, we currently work with 150 agencies, basically mainly in Europe, but we're currently starting to grow in Australia and in the US as well. And as I said, we just integrated with Greenhouse and JobBeta, so I guess we will expand via them as well. I mean, you've got 2000 agencies, so that would be a great opportunity as well. Do you currently offer some sort of software or solution for CV formatting in your tool? Not really, not really. So we don't have anything like that. Within PC Recruiter, we can parse the resumes in. And users can kind of edit them, reconfigure them, store multiple copies. But we don't have anything that would AI reformat or anything like that. We have a small AI suite, primarily content generation. So if you go to a candidate summary, you can hit a button. It'll pull the information from their resume and from their various different fields and generate a custom summary. So that's one thing we do. That's probably the closest we have to it, but we don't have any kind of automatic resume editing or anything like that. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Because obviously, like, that is from our perspective. We talk to a lot of agencies who are looking for a formatter. I can imagine that's also like a niche. but it could be interesting. What is the right thing to do? Would you mind if I share my screen and show you what we've got? Is it easiest if I talk to your colleague? Yeah. Well, I can take a quick look but I will also kind of see if you have any information you can send me. I'll share with my colleague James and kind of have him take a look and see if that is something. He kind of works heavily with the development team. He knows what we're working on, what we integrate with. He knows all the points about that as well. Nice, sounds good. What I will do, I will share my screen. Okay, let me see if I can make you the host, so it should ask you momentarily if you want to ...
