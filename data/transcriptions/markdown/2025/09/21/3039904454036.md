## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. I apologize. I could not hear you. What did you say your name was? Mackenzie. Mackenzie. Hi, Mackenzie. This is Amanda calling from ringside. How are you? Hi, Amanda. I'm actually looking at a ticket for ringside right now about QC Rangles ring central activities. Yes. Yes, that's exactly. I feel like it's been a saga for the last, couple weeks. I apologize. We've just been very busy lately. Low on people, high on tickets. I'm looking at this now. I'm trying to figure it out. It looks like UC Randall's set up with RingCentral. I'm not sure what's going wrong. I'm just trying to troubleshoot it right now. Do you have anything to add to this context or are you just wondering where it's at? Yeah, I don't really have anything, unfortunately, to add to it. We've done all of the, I guess, the troubleshooting on our side, you know, as far as, like, signing her out, signing, you know, re-authenticating her back in. And, you know, I even did on, like, the, you know, the admin user portion, you know, where you're entering in, like, their phone number and all that. you authenticate it there as well. So I've authenticated it in all places, double-checked, you know, she's using the RingCentral app, not the phone, but still does not seem to be picking up those those activities and I mean we know she's making dials and giving texts. Yeah, let's try and figure it out. It's actually really nice to have you that you can help me. We can maybe solve this together. Yeah, so I just adopted this database administrator role not too long ago, so I'm not as savvy as the last guy. But I was taught a couple things to do, and I did those couple things. But I'm not sure. I don't know. I kind of want to do them again now that her username's been reauthenticated today. So let me try and run these scripts again. It's basically just setting a date in a file back, and then the crawler should find it again. That's what I was told. Let me try to run this script again, and I'll see. If that does anything. What are you going back to, if I may ask? 89 days in the past because we can only find the last 90 days or so. So there's a script to go back to basically set her usernames file back 89 days and then in theory, our automated crawler or whatever, the service that does that should find it again and like catch up anything that they missed in those 89 days so i'm gonna run this again now that you've like authenticated her fresh today and see if it does anything perfect perfect yeah and that's she just started june so 89 days would hopefully catch anything since she's been here yeah ringside search underscore qc randall i was taking a look at the file and it was kind of interesting i don't know if i could delete this and it'll just recreate itself or not but her her ring central q file is like oh no it does have oh no uh yeah it's like missing a couple things that other usernames on your system have so i'm like wondering i wonder if i could just delete this and just re-establish would you be able to just re-establish it right now if i just kind of like swiped it and you just redid it um so like re-sign her out and then re-authenticate her well basically i'd be kind of deleting it from the back end so uh you wouldn't have to sign her out i'd be doing that uh but there's like this file that uh our queue like our sorry our crawler or the service that comes and finds it and like writes activities it'll find this file and it reads it and it should like write activities for that username but this for some whatever reason hers is like missing some stuff like what's your username if you don't mind me asking amanda yeah um it's just that amanda oh okay let me find it let me see yours let me find yours I'm looking at all of them and we said, okay, Amanda, I think I scrolled past it too quickly. Amanda, is this the error file or the actual file? What the heck? All right. How much time do you have, Amanda? I have some time. All right, great. Oh, that's why I searched. I want this file. I'm going to open yours. Yeah, you actually have a username and a value for the date and an ID. The QC Randall's file is just kind of blank. I'm wondering if I delete this and we start over kind of thing. You know? Let me compare again. I know you can't see what I'm doing. Sorry. No, no, no. You're good. You're good. Yeah, I've been trying to wrap my head around what's going on here. Also, I noticed that QCRandall doesn't have an error log file where all the other usernames do, which is abnormal. I have a question, Amanda. Do you know the lore or the history of your ringside search PCR account? and specifically there's two databases on the front end. There's like ringside search partners and then there's restore ringside search partners. Do you know why there's like one that says restore in, in the front of it? Or database in the past? I could believe that's, that's it. It's been, I've been here for, let's see, seven, seven years. And we've been using ...
