## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Deb Oaks from Wellbridge. How are you today? Oh, pretty good. How are you? Well, not too bad. So before I put in a feature request, I wanted to find out if this is something that can actually be done. What's that? Okay. When you add a position into PCR, the screen comes up and it doesn't give you the notes field to add in any additional notes. So below the groups, you could see job description and you can see internal job description, but the dropdown for notes isn't there. Let me check on mine. I know it may just be that you don't have it in your layout, but it also might be that doesn't show until the record's saved. But I don't remember. Hold on one second. Let me just confirm. It does show when I save it, it does. And then it shows up there. It's just it's a hassle. If I don't have to go back into the position to add a note, that would be saving just a little bit of time. Let me see. I have mine. Job description. I have notes in there. So if I was adding a new. I see a thing that says use template. So I don't know if it's something that I need to create. And notes just apparently when you have to create it and then they get appended to it. I want to say notes are maybe a little bit different for positions. Actually, they were just changed later. Okay. So it's like it gives me minimum salary and max salary. There isn't really. Yeah. Even when you're adding. If I want a bonus to show up like under max salary, I'd have to actually do that in a position configuration. Right. and then it'll show up in the unknown position? So the notes area, even if you're adding a name, they don't show until the record's saved. Right. Okay. So you've got to save it first. So then I guess I need to put in a feature request for that. Yeah, that probably will not change. It probably has something to do with how it has to be saved and then related and indexed related to a record. Oh, okay. So that's probably why. Because even on names, it does the same thing. Okay. Things like resumes, activities, there actually has to kind of be a record for it to be attached to, it looks like. So that is why on those. All right. So then if I want to, because lately we've been getting a lot of roles that are giving me minimum and maximum salary, and then they're in like, and then plus a bonus. And so is that something that if I added into like my layout in the position field, you know, like the edit position area, like add that into group one will it then show that field when we go into add a new position yeah and the field data the groups that would show it's just you would have if you changed it for yours you would have to copy your layout to other users right and i realized that so i just wanted to see if you know if that was something if i do that if that's something that i can put in there before i go and do this because i'm like i'm not going to waste my time if it's not going going to show up in the add new position field. Because if I get that, then I may not have to worry about copying the note into the notes section, because that's usually what I end up doing is having to put, you know, they're like, oh, well, plus, you know, they get a bonus and a car allowance and all that stuff. But if I can put the bonus percentage up in there, then that's one less step because not everybody gets car allowance. Yeah, you could have like a custom field. As long as it's in your layout, it would be in the add position screen. Okay. Okay. So partially good news, right? Yeah. It's just I didn't know if I added there if that would do it into the ad position. So I want to make sure before I went ahead and did that and change it for everybody only to find out that no, that doesn't work. Yeah. Got to save it first. Then you can put your notes in. Okay. All right. Sounds good. All right. Well, thank you. Appreciate your time. Have a good day. Oh, you know what? I know I probably make you do that because not everybody would even have notes in the layout too. So it has to be saved and then you can add them. So that's probably why. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. All right. Sounds good. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye....
