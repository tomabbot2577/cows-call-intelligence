## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Hi, this is Jan.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** Hey, Jan, it's Jim from EC Recruiter.

**[0:04] Speaker_01:** Yeah, Jan, do you hear me?

**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Hey, Jim, how's it going?

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** Not too bad, not too bad.

**[0:08] Speaker_01:** I wanted to give a call.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** I got your ticket update here just to confirm.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I realized the month-to-month agreement I sent was for five users.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** I need to correct it to one, so I will go ahead and do that in a minute here.

**[0:21] Speaker_01:** And then your final data transfer, are you looking for that to happen on the 27th Friday afternoon, or should you wait until the 30th?

**[0:29] Speaker_01:** What's preferred?

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** No, no, we're ready to do it on that date I put down twice now, which was Friday the 27th.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** Perfect.

**[0:40] Speaker_01:** All right, that's what I had.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** Yep, that is good.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** At noon is ideal.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Okay, perfect.

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** And have you filled out the form for that data transfer yet?

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** I don't really know what form you're talking about.

**[0:58] Speaker_00:** I already did one for the first one, and this is the second one for the same project.

**[1:06] Speaker_01:** Perfect.

**[1:07] Speaker_01:** Same thing.

**[1:07] Speaker_01:** They'll need a form each time.

**[1:09] Speaker_01:** I will route this ticket over to Nick, and he'll email that to you, the form, the invoice.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** We'll get those two done between today and Friday, and I will queue it up to be pulled Friday at noon.

**[1:19] Speaker_00:** Yeah, and you said get two done.

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** We've already had one done.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** so what do you need to do why did you say you need to get two done get two oh no well i don't think i said no not two done we have just one backup on the the 27th at noon and they just need a new uh form and invoice each time because it's per oh i thought you said you don't need a new form and invoice each time oh no you do yeah with that they need a new form and invoice just to make sure it's legit and pay the cost to do it or whatever.

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** So I will have Nick get that to you.

**[2:01] Speaker_01:** Okay, great.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** I will then send over, I'll send over the new contract for the month-to-month one user.

**[2:08] Speaker_01:** That way, once you sign that, you don't auto-renew on the 29th of this month.

**[2:12] Speaker_01:** You'll be on a month-to-month for as long or short as you need to be as we proceed.

**[2:15] Speaker_01:** Right.

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** Yep, yep.

**[2:17] Speaker_00:** Yeah, just need confirmation that the 27th is going to work because I submitted that nine days ago and didn't hear anything back, and that's kind of unnerving.

**[2:24] Speaker_00:** Perfect.

**[2:25] Speaker_00:** No, it will be good, and I will let them know that you want confirmation.

**[2:29] Speaker_01:** Okay, great.

**[2:30] Speaker_01:** Thank you.

**[2:31] Speaker_00:** I'll look for the email from Nick.

**[2:33] Speaker_00:** Okay, bye-bye.

**[2:35] Speaker_01:** Bye-bye.
