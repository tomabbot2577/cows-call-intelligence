## 💬 Full Transcript

 Kathy. Hey, it's Robin. Hey. Hey. I might have messed something up. And I don't know why or how. And I don't know how. I really don't. So MedBest was one of those customers with the sales receipts issues. And they wanted a 10-month plan. So Bill said, well, if you agree to start on August 1st. I didn't want it to be recurring because if they ever try to cancel, I don't want it to be. I want them to like exist so that they're still paid because it's passed off so what i did is i created one and everything was going fine and then i was using the duplicate option yeah and it was putting like a dollar sign after the number that i don't pretty sure i'm pretty sure i didn't put it in there no no take it out because i had to make a i had to make a an invoice earlier and i had a an r in it And I think I put a dollar sign at first by mistake, and then I changed it to an R because I had to change the invoices for JobMatcher so they can repay the ones that came back out of our account because they didn't use their positive pay system right. So all you have to do is manually change the account number. Okay, so I did do that. I did do that, but then I noticed that it used some of the same invoice numbers that somebody already had, which I thought was really odd as well. Well, if somebody else is doing something at the same time, it could get confused as to what's the next number to use. Okay. So you would just want to put in the next number. okay because something for but this is what's really weird this invoice for frontline staffing that it used the same number for yeah wait 2203943 that's like one of them that was an invoice from july 10th so i don't know how it's really using the same numbers um yeah i would change the one that's that's that's duplicated so you don't so it's not really like change it to that one to be an eight you know at the end or something and if it says that number's already in use then change it to a nine you know until you find the next um number so i did 10 of them am i better off making i wonder if anyone else is let me see these other numbers seven how are these getting all like duplicated numbers I don't get it every number I did so what um let me let me see if I go to a new invoice um it's going to give me oh see well okay here's the thing so 22039 that was the number that was done in July that I had to fix. So I changed that number to be the old number with an R so that it would correspond because their payment failed. So I went back and used that number. So if you go to invoices to the tab under sales, it says invoices and you sort by number so that you get the. Yeah. So apparently all the new invoices are getting these older numbers. Well, there shouldn't really be a lot of invoices created right now. They should have already been done. Like is it a big deal if a customer has two invoices with the same number? Is there at least a unique number in the backup? Yes, it needs to be a unique number. So the latest number was 2204. So 2204069, no, that's you. 2204463 was created today, earlier today. So 2204464 would be the first open number. Wait, is it 2204? 4, 6, 4. 2204. 4. Okay, 220, double 4 is 6, 4. 6, 4, yeah. So I got to go in and change each one of these that I just did? Yes, uh-huh, because we don't want to duplicate one. So we have a whole bunch dated 8, 1 already. Why? Well, those must be ones that we had fixed before. We have a whole bunch because they're partially paid. So just the med best ones. I wonder if you can just edit it from this line. That would be nice, but I doubt it. I'm in there trying to change them. I just did the August and September one. That's the only thing I really don't like about it, auto-numbering, is because if there's any change in something, then it keeps that in the auto-numbering. Yeah, I'm like, I didn't put a dollar sign. I didn't even go into that field. I don't know what's going on. And then I changed it after that, thinking it would catch up, but it didn't, I guess. Yeah, I was like, what did I do wrong? Nothing. You didn't do anything wrong. Okay. I mean, I know I could have just done this as a recurring, but I didn't want it to be overlooks that it's owed. That's totally fine. You guys out of state, that's good. For these ones that I... Instead of six months, they let them do it over ten? This one, yeah, we went ahead and did it for these people. They've been around forever. And it was a lot. Yeah, it was a lot. So, it is what it is. and this is on top of their their monthly though right so yeah okay the bill says yeah as long as we're started for august 1st we'll do that so i went and i didn't hear back i'm starting them and yep it is what it i mean this they didn't give any pushback some people are like really nice about it and some people are quite the opposite. It's like, it's your mistake. It's like, well, I read the one email too. It's like, yeah, but you didn't notice it either. Yeah. Well, you obviously didn't point it out, but you u...
