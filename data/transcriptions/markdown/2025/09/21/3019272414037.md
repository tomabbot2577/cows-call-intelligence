## 💬 Full Transcript

 welcome to zoom enter your meeting ID enter your participant ID followed you are in the meeting now you are the first participant please stand by Thank you. um Thank you. Thank you. you Hello. Hello Daniel, how are you? Good and you? I'm well, I'm well. So I wanted to show you around PCRecruiter a little bit and kind of show you a demo. I'm just going to kind of take you on a general walkthrough of PCRecruiter but did you have any initial questions or requirements that you needed to see as as we take a look at this. The shop questions don't ring. Right now, I don't. Okay, perfect, perfect. So as we go through here, so I'm gonna kind of share my screen here and kind of walk you through a general PC recruiter walkthrough. So it's gonna be a cloud-based system. It's gonna run on a PC or a Mac. It'll work on Safari, Edge, Chrome browsers. Chrome's probably the most popular. and so a lot of different ways you can access the database. So getting logged in, I'm gonna go ahead and get logged. Do you see my screen okay? Yeah, I can see your screen. Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and get myself logged in with the password and then I am logged into the system and the PCRecruiter database is gonna look pretty much like this. And I say pretty much because it's quite configurable so you can actually pick and choose what tiles are gonna show in the top, in what order. You can move the fields around on the screens. You can set up your own lists, your own kind of widgets around here. So a lot of things you can really tailor to your liking. But the basic look and feel, you're gonna have a menu bar at the top. That's gonna be your main navigation. The center area is gonna be for searching, search results and lists. And then the bottom portion's gonna be for the records themselves as you're going through the system. So open your main menu bar. That's gonna be where you get to the three primary record types we work with, those being names, companies, and positions. So those are gonna be kind of the three primary record types, they're all cross-related. So the name area, names are gonna be your candidates, but also your contacts, so any person whose contact info you need to have in your database, they're gonna go under a name record. And then that name record can be linked to a specific company record, maybe the company they work for. Or if they're a candidate, usually we'll just create a kind of a fictitious record called candidates resumes or something and link the candidates all to that specific company record companies are the companies you're working with or the companies you're marketing toward so you can track potential client companies in there and tag the contacts to those company records and then of course the jobs you're looking to fill the positions so those jobs are going to be entered into PC recruiter linked back to the company that therefore and you're going to have the capacity to post those jobs and share those jobs you could do some different things once you put the job openings in PCRecruiter. Okay, so they can feed to your website. So we have an integrated job board which will allow you to post jobs directly to your website as soon as you enter them in PCRecruiter. You're also going to be able to share them with a feed to Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, some different things you can do as far as feeding the jobs. There's even a shareable link that you can just email out or blast it out in an email it'll show the link to that job on your website so a few different places that we can share job openings in PCRecruiter so those are our three main record types some of the other elements up in this main menu you have a daily schedule that's merely a calendar for scheduling meetings phone calls or follow-ups your roll-up list that is a list tool so you can actually build lists within PCRecruiter and you're going to be able to go into roll-ups and you can go ahead and see here's all the roll-up lists we have I click into one list I can see that list of individuals here roll up lists are nice because you can mark them different stages statuses priorities so there's some different things you can do as far as that goes also a lot of the reporting options are up here you have reports you have analytics reporting your sequences are also found in that main menu bar so that main menu bar is going to be really the bulk of your primary navigation I like to always start around the company screen because the company screen kind of ties the names the positions together So if I go into my company, I open up the company screen right there. I'm going to be able to see there's the last 50 companies that I was working with in my database. Or I could go ahead and click right there, and I could search part of a company name or something like that if I wanted to pull it right up. And when I do go into the company record, I'm going to be able to see that company record down below. This is a configurable screen, so you can put in any field...
