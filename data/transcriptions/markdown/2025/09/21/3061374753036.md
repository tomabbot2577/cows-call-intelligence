## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. My name is Ahmed Kurtam. I'm with DesignForce. I'm one of your customers. Okay. Got you here. Awesome. How can I help you today? My team is having a total meltdown on ways to be able to communicate with our clients. Okay. So I am less knowledgeable about this, but I have browsed all of your articles and gone through all of your additional training. And I don't seem to have a streamlined idea of what the best solution is for what we're trying to accomplish with in terms of client communication of our search process. Okay. So, what we have right now, we're an agency and we have a number of routine searches and we want to be able to have either real-time reporting with our clients or a weekly report giving dispelling our pipeline and our pipeline status. And what we love is the view within pipeline, within PCR9, where you can see it through staging and in summary of each candidate. We've never used client portal or presentation. It seems presentation is maxed out at 10 people. Right. For presentation, which doesn't work. We want to be able to reveal both our source or what you might call a roll-up as well as people that have entered into the pipeline or the candidate process. Mm-hmm. Okay. Help me through this. So the presentations, yeah, wouldn't be the answer. that's just going to show you certain fields per record and their attachments and resumes as a presentation of who the candidate is but there are let's see there are reports called applicant tracking reports as anybody mention it yeah I've seen those and let me just go to report I was just looking at pipeline reports applicant tracking report and and then I would export that into Excel right so you can adjust date range and then certain filters so filter by the position ID if you just want to show people in a certain position. You'd filter by company name. So any of the positions related to a certain company, you could filter even by certain steps. So just show everybody related to the offer pending step if you have one of those steps or something. And you could use those filters in combination. And then, yeah, you would export it to Excel, like you said, and it would show you date and time stamps of you know where people are in what steps um and did that yeah might be a good starting place for what you're looking for still not thrilled with that excel sheet it's a aesthetically displeasing and b um Can I add a notes section? Like, can I edit this report? The applicant tracking report has a few fields that I don't want, right? like username, position ID, date posted. I mean, they're all blank, so I don't want them on the report. And then gender, too, right? Like, that's not great. Right. Okay, yeah. You can build a custom applicant tracking report that has, you know, all those same filters when you go to run it. The problem is when I've come to try to build a custom one, I don't know what field is what because of an extraordinarily large list of fields that are populated from my company's database. database. Like it has like all of these weird titles and be like copy of copy, you know, company name. And it's just like getting into the type of report that I need is like, has been really laborious. Yeah. So it might be, let me see here. I'd like to share my screen with you and show you what I'm talking about. Yeah, that'll work. Yeah, if you just want to open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And once you're there, is it asking you for a meeting ID? Yes. Yep. Okay. That's 220-778-326. Because my team is, like, really unhappy with me using PCR, to be honest with you. And I'm trying to find a way to make this work, but I'm not sure it's going to, given what I'm seeing here. All right. Yeah, I see. All right. So you can just mute the audio at the bottom left so there's no echo. And then click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up towards the top. Awesome. I can see that. So, I'd like to have my team be able to update a position. So, what I'm aiming for. Let's start with that. Okay. I love the way this looks, right? And I wish to be able to show that to my clients. If I could have a spreadsheet that could have something exactly like this, right, and, like, remove this column, what I would love is it to be gridded this way right and and then if it could have like the ability to be able to push like a note section here and have that be a report that would be all okay yeah so our pipeline doesn't really export and end up being like a visually similar thing. It is going to look like that applicant tracking report in Excel, but we can build the report to just show all the fields that you want. So name, status. Let's start with that because I can use an AI tool if the report's being generated, right, to be able to then make it aesthetically more pleasing. ...
