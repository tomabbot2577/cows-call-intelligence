## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. How are you, Amanda Jones? I'm well, Amanda. How are you? Good, good. Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. For sure, for sure. I just wanted to see how I could help. It looks like you might have used us in the past. I'm not sure. My CEO, Jeremy Anderson, may have. I've been with him three and a half years or so. We used Big Miller when I started with him for about the first year, and then we transitioned to Creeley two years ago. We haven't found that it's very user-friendly. We really haven't used Creeley as much as we would have liked to. It's presented a lot of challenges for us. Okay. Yeah, it looks like he used to the past canceled in 19, so quite a while ago. Yeah, he said he's used it before because he's been in recruiting a long time. I've never seen what the interface looks like. If it's anything like BigBiller, we're looking for a simpler platform, kind of like BigBiller, not as intense as Creeley, and something that has really good recording, maybe has a planner to create, like, prompt the scheduled calls each day and follow-ups. And also a big thing for us is having a business development workflow for whether we're doing MPC outreach and calls or we have an SDR tracking open ads and hiring managers. I know Big Biller had a really good workflow for that, and Creeley doesn't seem to have a sales development representative workflow. Okay. We do have something like that for sure. For sure. We actually have a newer interface than the last time you used. So it is going to be a nice fresh new interface I can show you around if you'd like kind of show you some of those main points and kind of share my screen Yeah, that'd be great Fantastic excellent, so let me share my screen here. Let me know once you see it You should be looking at a screen for PC recruiter Okay, I can see it Perfect, perfect. So let me get logged in and kind of show you around, kind of the basics here. So as I get logged in, this is all cloud-based. It's going to be accessible PC or Mac. There's a mobile app, so a lot of different ways you can access it. But once we get logged in, we are going to have a number of different things that we can do. The left-hand side of the screen is going to kind of be your primary menu. So that's going to be where you'd get to your name records, companies, positions. Those are kind of our three primary record types. So those are going to give you the ability to track names, could be candidates, could be contacts, could be potential passive candidates, pretty much any person that you wish to track and store in PcRecruiter. The companies are going to be companies you're working with, also companies you're marketing toward. We do have a full sales pipeline that's called the deals workflow in here as well. And then positions, jobs you're looking to fill. So those are kind of our three main record types within PC Recruiter. They're all interrelated, all interconnected. We've also got some different things. For example, Rollups. Rollups is kind of a list creation tool. So you can build lists, save groups of people. I could have like account manager candidates, like this first list I'm looking at. Or maybe I have a list of companies I'm marketing toward. So I've got all sorts of different uses. I've got like companies here in Boston. So I can kind of create these different lists and I can always go into any of the lists. Open that list right up. Full mass communication. We have email sequences. We have drip campaigns. So you can kind of mass communicate these individuals or you can click on to each individual record. Open up a custom view of the record. Whatever fields you want to see. Maybe even the resume. So you have a lot of information there as well. You're also going to have a schedule. So your schedule is going to be kind of your daily to-do list. So you're going to be able to place various meetings, phone calls, whatnot on that calendar. There's a different view. I usually like the day view because it kind of lets me, I can see a little double-click, I can see what I'm going to talk about, I can color code these scheduled items, but some people like to look at it in a list view or a month view. So you could do some different things like that too. So this is going to be your schedule for creating phone calls and you could even put one of those roll-up lists on the schedule in like a two-hour block so that you know that that hours blocked you call everyone on that list or something like that okay okay and then you're also going to have a deals pipeline excuse me so the deals pipeline is going to give you the capacity to put in different company records as these cards and then you can move them through a process here so maybe you've contacted them, they need an assessment, you sent a contract, cont...
