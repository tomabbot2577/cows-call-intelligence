## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Gus in Atlanta. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Great, great, great. Thanks. Quick question. I'm trying to update our presentation template with our new logo. Okay. So I'm in presentation settings, but I don't see this. And I tried to look it up on ChatGPT, but I don't see how I could add the logo. Yeah, I wouldn't look up any of our sections in ChatGPT. Sometimes it gets some really wrong stuff. I had somebody do that. I'm like, oh, that's not right at all. So what you're going to do, okay, so you're under system, right? Yeah. Okay. So you'll click on your template name, and then up at the top, like, so when you're – hold on one second. Let me just get there so I don't stumble over my words as much as I would. Okay. So when you have your template up, over at the right where you see kind of like where a spacing where you would have the header, like above your fields and your section, you'll click directly on that spot. Yeah. And it says upload new image. Right. Then you're going to browse and upload. Then it's going to list it. And then you actually have to click on it once it's uploaded. Because you could upload like five times at once. That's what I was missing. Yeah. I trust me. I have done it myself. I'm like, wait a minute. And I'm like, oh, yeah, you have to select it. Like you could upload four different files there. And so you have to pick which one. Most of the time you're just doing one. So it's not as obvious that you might have to actually click it. And once it turns blue, then you know that it's selected. Let me go back and do that again. Candidate. OK. Candidate. Presentation templates. and then I'll select this one. Okay. Click. Click. And then close. Does it automatically save? No, you'll have to. So once you upload it, you'll have to click save at the bottom right. Like you should see it in your tablet now. It doesn't say save. It just says close. Oh, okay. So, yeah. So, oh, you're in that screen? Okay, yeah. So do you see where it says image name date? Is it like blue like it's selected? Yes, ma'am. Okay. So that's good. Then hit close. And you should see that image in your presentation. Yeah. How do I make my presentation background white? I think it all depends on the themes that you're using. Okay, so let me look at my theme. Select a theme. Yeah. Arrow. All of them. Sometimes there what I've done is taken the code from some themes and modified it. Like which one were you using before? I think it was Arrow. Okay. let me see customize hold on let me take this throw in here let me see if I can what kind of colors do you want to use blue blue and white modify this style sheet code to have a white background and what kind of blue do you want to use? Like a navy or a royal? It's kind of like a powder blue. Okay. Let's see if this worked. Otherwise, I might need to have maybe somebody like Drew do it. I'm just kind of throwing in chat, GPT, having it modify the colors, like from one of the original things. I'm going to check this out in my own database, though. Another question. Does PC Recruiter have an integration with Wedge? With who? Wedge? Mm-hmm. I've never heard of them, to be honest. It's Wedge HR. They do, like, video resumes. Oh, no. I mean, sometimes people do things through an API, but there's so many services out there. It's almost hard to keep up with them anymore. Yeah, it's true. And we don't like spending too much. In, like, our developer time, you know, just like, oh, one person wants to use it. It's not worth it for us to take developers and projects. Okay, so I'm going to try this. Let's go new theme. New theme, and we'll call it – Oh, there it is. Save presentation template. Okay, continue. Okay. And then let me go to the – okay, here's this. Here's this. Close. Save presentation template. Okay. I'm going to try doing, what is this doing, mine? Powder blue. Well, kind of. Let's see. I'm going to go down there. Well, here, I'm going to take this code that I generated. Let me find your stuff. Hold on one second. okay bear with me I am going to I'm going to try to upload I'm not a good peace recruiter when you get into like all that style sheet code I'm not the best so I just kind of threw it in chat GPT and then from here. Which database are you in? Staff Financial. Okay. And what's your PCR username? I don't need the password, just the username? Gus. Just Gus. All right. Let me see. Okay. Presentations. Candidate presentation templates. Okay, which one were you working in? The NSG. The military, the NSG, and the HMT. Okay, let's just do the NSG Canada presentation with logo. Does that sound okay? Yes. I'm going to try styling, edit, new, theme name, white wrist powder blue. My style sheet. I'm going to throw this in there. Phase. Okay. If we don't like this template styling, we can go from here. Let me just see what it looks like. Why didn't it change it yet? Oh, maybe it still needs a phase. H...
