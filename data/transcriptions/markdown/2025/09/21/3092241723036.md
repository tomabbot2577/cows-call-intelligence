## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Chris with Integra Partners. And I am needing some assistance on how to disconnect our users, their PCR and their RingCentral. We want to unintegrate them. I know that's not the right language, but you get what I'm trying to say. Yeah, yeah. That makes sense. So you would just need to kind of clear out anything in the system settings. Let me walk you through that. So if you go to System in the main menu up at the top, and then on the left, go to Users, and then Manage Users. And you'll see your list there, and just select any user. and then in the bottom frame next to contact phone is a little gear icon. Click on that. Oh under contact information, okay contact phone, got it. Awesome and that'll open a pop-up window where RingCentral is mostly likely selected on the left and you can kind of clear out those phone numbers in the two fields, phone number, direct dial and then make sure to select a different option on the left instead of RingCentral. So maybe just mobile dial, just have that highlighted and selected before you hit save. Gotcha. So that it's not highlighting RingCentral. And that should do it for each user. Just remember to hit save on that. And then we have seen users get an email or at least like the admin user get an email saying, RingCentral has been disconnected or please reconnect. So if you start seeing that email, let us know. I could have the tech team kind of go in the back end of the database and clear out some things related to the user that it's sending you emails about. Okay. So do you think it matters which thing I select other than RingCentral on the tiles on the left? I clicked on mobile dial and then it got a pop-up that said the user must have primary PCR recruited app installed on their mobile device. Select your device if you see your device. If you don't click here, I don't. Okay, yeah. Just leave that toggle to off, but just have mobile dial like highlighted and selected on the left before hitting save. That should do it. Okay, so I did that and want to go back in and look at hers again to see if it's stuck the phone numbers are gone it still is that the tile that's highlighted when I reopen her is still ring central okay let's see what's another good one just I guess any other let's just try I wouldn't see what where yeah just hit save Okay, let me try it again. Ashley, you'll... Okay, that changed it to something else. So it's not highlighted as RingCentral anymore. So I think her numbers are not showing up when I open RingCentral. Good, yeah. That sounds good. Yeah, just the last thing selected shouldn't be RingCentral. And that should do it. But like we said, sometimes we do see like an annoying email send through to the admin. And if that starts happening for any of those users that you're turning off, just let us know and the tech team will be able to clear some things further out in the back end. Okay. All right. All right. I appreciate your help. Thank you very much. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Okay, great. Thanks....
