## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Julian Rees with Chapo Solutions. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Thanks. I had questions on generic file map or importing. Okay. Imported. Gotcha. B files, kind of where my head's at. The first question, I'll tell you what I'm trying to accomplish. The quickest, most efficient way to import multiple CSV files into PCR without doing too much, yeah, without it taking too much time, essentially. And I have files that have – and correct me if I'm wrong. Did we connect earlier, like two weeks ago or a week ago? Possibly. I know you talk with a lot of people. Yes, sir. Okay. Basically, I have – see, a CSV file has columns with a lot of different data, like a lot of different data. And it's coming from Salesforce, essentially. And so, it's data I would like to have in there, but maybe only a couple I would really want. And so, if I import these columns and I just map them to customized field, and there is not a customized field for it, it will create a new customized field and put the data in there. Is that correct? That's correct. And it will create the custom field based on the exact title of that column. So if you name that column like, you know, email secondary, that's exactly how it will display as a new custom field. And if other. If I do one Excel file and the other one has a column with the exact same name, it would import it into that column. or that customers field that already exists then at that point. Yeah, because you created it with the first one, yeah. Okay. That might save me. Importing the keywords, like into the keyword field. Oh, right, yeah. If I wanted to do multiple, like, hey, how does that work? And if I wanted to, in one column, let's call it keywords, and I had multiple keywords in there, how does it differentiate and separate them, et cetera? Good question. So for the keywords specifically, well, anywhere in your CSV file, you don't really want to use commas because comma tells the system it's a new cell. So if you have multiple keywords, instead of commas, you need to put the double, it's two bars. It's the pipe. I don't know what they call it, actually. Above your enter key, if you hold shift, there's that straight line. You'll want two of those double bars in between each keyword term rather than a comma. That will separate those out so you can have a list. I think the only limitation is there's 250 character limit for each cell. So if there's too many keywords, it might start cutting things off after 250 characters. Because, like, I have a lot of tags from, like, half of me thinks. Otherwise, for a customized field, is it unlimited or is it still 250 characters? It's still 250. Oh, man. Can you have it mapped to two – one column mapped to two different fields in PCR? are? Oh, I've never tried that, but I imagine you can use that drop-down to map to different fields. You know what I'm saying? Like, it's like, hey, put it here and also put it here. Yeah, I imagine you can, because it doesn't disappear from the drop-down if you go to map that, you know, same column to a different destination field. As you map them, they don't disappear from the list. So, imagine you can point it in two places. Okay. Another thing, if I had columns that all said notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes. I'm just thinking, I'm thinking out loud, like, could I import multiple columns to the notes and they create multiple notes? It would, no, yeah, you can only, so the destination would be notes. So you can only choose one column to send to that. You would probably have to combine the notes in there into one column in your CSV file, most likely. And that's still the 250 character limit and the double bars separates the notes? Right. Yep. Okay. We do have, let me think here, we do have an option. If there's stuff you really need past 250 characters, There is a way to import by making a Microsoft Access database file. I could find maybe instructions for that, if that's something you want to explore later on. If there's, you know, things past 250. Yeah, no, I appreciate it for sure. If you imported notes, does it import the column header? No, it'll just... Just the cell data. Just the cell data, yep. Multiple import. Duplicate found. Basically, I've separated it out by lists, and I'm going to import it list by list by list, if that makes sense, like roll up by roll up by roll up. And then there's a final CSV that has everybody. Oh, okay. I am thinking the best way to duplicate check that when I do the final one. I don't know if I'm going to do the final one or not. But probably his first name, last name, and then update if found. The only options there will be, they don't have one just for first name, last name. It would be first name, last name, company name, I think is the safest one to use. There is one thing I always, whenever I'm training on this, to point out with that duplicate c...
