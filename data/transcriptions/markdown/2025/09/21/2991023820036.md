**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Hi, this is Scott.

**[0:02] Speaker_00:** Hello, Scott.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** It's Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** Hey, Jim.

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** I'm doing pretty good.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** How about you?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I am well.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** I just wanted to give you a quick call.

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** Just to make sure, about a little over an hour ago, you got an email from Mackenzie to confirm that the data was moved.

**[0:16] Speaker_00:** So I just wanted to make sure you were now using your database under the Z group.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** You know what?

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** I couldn't get on there.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** Hold on.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** It wasn't on there a little while ago.

**[0:26] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:26] Speaker_01:** Let me go over here.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** She said it could take up to 24 hours.

**[0:32] Speaker_00:** Okay, let me see.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** I just, oh, well, I was able to log in.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Let me see what database, what data might be in there.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** If I just look at a blank names, 178,000 names.

**[0:41] Speaker_00:** So it looks like probably most of it's there, if not all.

**[0:45] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I can't, you know what, I'm logging on to it using the administrator password I had.

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** That ZRG that he emailed to you?

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** Yeah, make sure you didn't get a space at the beginning of it.

**[1:00] Speaker_00:** Sometimes that pops in because I got right in using that.

**[1:04] Speaker_00:** Like I'm logged in looking at it, and it looks like everything's there, 35,000 or so companies.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

**[1:18] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I already had it saved, and when I log in to the admin, I'll tell you exactly what the yeah it's the admin and I use that Z group uppercase arrow up four eight seven six and I still can't I don't see ya yeah I copied it right off the password and it got me right in and you only want that Let me try and copy that password and do that.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** Yeah, and you can change it once you get in the first time if you wish.

**[1:53] Speaker_00:** Or you could go in under the system.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** I think all your users are there, but what he does is he resets them all to that password.

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** And then from there, you might delete these other users, change your SSRally1 to a new username that you'll be – or a new password that you can recall or something like that.

**[2:11] Speaker_01:** Yeah, see, I'm not – hold on.

**[3:49] Speaker_00:** And obviously anything you put in there wouldn't be included, but you're here.

**[3:53] Speaker_01:** Can we still look over to that just to get ideas of what, how we want to set this one up?

**[3:58] Speaker_00:** Well, it's open and it should be just whenever Barry closes at probably the end of this month.

**[4:02] Speaker_00:** So I think we're going to leave it for another week.
