## 💬 Full Transcript

 Chris, it's Jim with PCE Recruiter. How are you? I'm doing good. Wanted to give a call and get your voicemail. I think it was yesterday. Said you had another question or two about that potential new user. So I thought I'd give you a quick call. Yeah, I'm not sure. I think we answered the questions. And basically, it was, well, I guess now that I'm thinking it through, I think the mechanics of having another user just go in and use my password, that's absolutely no issue. I guess one of the things I wanted to explore is I may be a little bit outside the window, but I knew I had some additional training time that I had not used. Would that be something I might be able to shift over and have my new recruiter use when I get her on board? Well, it looks like probably, yes, it looks like, because I'm looking, it's good for six months. $10.08. Oh, let's see. Oh, I'll have to check and see, because it's not expired time-wise, but I don't know if you used it all. As I'm going through here, that field is blank, so I'll have to check with Robin to see if there is any training. If there's any left, you should be able to use it for that new user. That should be no problem. so that would be good. And since you're going to let them use your username or they're going to use the admin and you're not logging in, you'll still be one user, right? I think we talked all about that. That is accurate, yeah. That is good. Yeah, it looks like as I'm going through here, it looks like you use four and a half. It looks like you do have some time left. Oh, yeah, I know I have time left. I was just, I didn't know if there was a window where I needed to utilize or whatever, but I know I have a number of hours left, so hopefully I can use those once I get her on board. I believe they don't show as having expired, so they should still be good. Excellent. Okay, well, that's very helpful. I'll continue my discussions with the new recruiter, and I'll keep you posted. All right, very well. Thank you, sir. Thank you for the call. You bet. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
