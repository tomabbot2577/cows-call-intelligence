## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. Good morning. My name is Kerry O'Donnell. I'm working with the Rogan Group. I wanted to reach out as one of our databases that we use, the TRG legal database. It seems to be copying titles and making them into the one that into a Dropbox. It just seems to be creating titles on the fly. Is there a way to turn that off? Yeah, let me pull you up here. Let me just take a look. What's your username for that database? Kerry, K-E-R-R-Y. That's simple enough there. Yeah, so if you can kind of see what I'm doing in here, the example I would give you would be Greg Simcox. And then if you look at the industry title, it says Senior Legal Counsel-US Real Estate. And then when you go into our title section in the drop box and you go to number nine, it appears to have been made that title like a general title for us. it looked like at one point, now I can't seem to find it, but it just seems to be... We've had this issue with capture with the agencies on the insurance side. Now we've figured out how to stop that from happening, where it was just creating duplicate companies when not being selected properly. It's almost like that's happening within the title section of this. So the way those title boxes work is when you click that drop box, like the pop-out for it, what it will display is any title that is on a record in the database. That's how that box is designed to work. I'm sorry, I'm a little confused, because for the insurance database, that doesn't happen. Unless you have like a custom field. Okay, so how would I activate that in this database? Let me take a look. Just to give you an example for the insurance side, right, a lot of times salespeople will be under the title vice president, and we'll change that to employee benefits or commercial producer within our system. But the vice president never shows up in that title box. Let me take a look here. Give me one second. Because you do have the locked field in the other one. I'm wondering if that's... Give me one second here. I'm just looking at it. So, ah, I see what it is. So, in the legal database, you have just the regular title field. In the insurance database, you have what's called the title locked field. Okay. And with that locked field, in the system settings, an admin level user, which you're a partial admin, so you should be able to do this. So if you go to System, Database Setup, and then Titles, you have your list of titles there. Yes, sir. If you were to switch in your layout from the Title field to the Title Locked field, that pop-up will only display the titles that you have available. Yep, the ones that are in that list. Gotcha. Now, how do I make that switch? So if you go to any name record, so if you click name up at the top, and even if you just go to Greg, in the action menu for that record, so like right next to that little building icon, you'll go into that menu and you'll go to customize. Yep. And in there you'll see that you have that predefined title. You'll just click on that and click into that drop down. And instead of title, you'll pick title locked. And then once you have title lock selected, you'll go to the drop down menu in the top right and hit save. and then once you hit save you can exit out of that tab and just click on greg again up top to reload it yes okay so now that let me just forward yep let me double check there I'm just taking a look at These fields. Why does it not like that one? I'm still seeing all those other ones in there. Well, is it possible that they all got added, so now they're locked in? Because when I can do that, if it's locked, I can go to our legal guy and just say, hey, pick out the titles you don't need, delete them, and then we should be good? Am I correcting that assumption? Yep. okay not a problem yeah and then as you have come across other ones like titles that you know shouldn't be there if you just change them on the records to the correct ones they'll start to disappear from that list as well gotcha now would that take how would you get in there and choose which ones you want to get rid of would that be through the same thing we just kind of went through in the system So, yeah, those are ones that you want to keep, but you will need to, like, update records. Like, that title pop-out, even though it's locked, is still showing the, like, anybody's title on there. So I'm taking a look at that real quick. Give me two seconds. Oh, I see what you're saying, Mark. Do I possibly need to log out and log back in? No, you shouldn't have to do that. Yes. okay Thank you. okay so Thank you. Thank you. just testing this out on my end here. Thank you. Thank you. Hmm. oh All right. So I don't waste too much of your time here. What's a good number I can give you a call back at? I'm going to have to ask someone about this one. No problem. 4-4-3-9-7-7-13-23. All righty. Yeah, let me just give one of my coworkers here a qu...
