## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. Tyler, happy to help you. Hey, Tyler, is Matt Mueller not there any longer? He is not. Oh, I hate that. I could email him any time for the last several years we've been with you guys, and now we're having an issue and I don't know who to talk with. Well, this is the general support line. I could give you a hand. Okay. Well, the feature that we use every single day in PCR besides parsing is we edit the personal information off of the resumes, off the PDFs, and input our electronic stamp. and I don't know if I was doing something yesterday or what, but all of a sudden I can't edit anything now. And that is not good because I edit about five to ten resumes every single day of the year, and for me not to be able to do that is a huge issue. So like you're hitting the edit button inside of PC Recruiter and nothing's opening up? Yeah, I would hit the little pencil, and then I would go in there and I would erase it, or I would do the upload and upload it to a Word doc or a Word docs, and then I would edit it there, and then I'd save it on my computer, and then I'd send it out to the prospective employer. I'm not able to do that now. It will not edit whatsoever, any resume, whether it's a PDF, a Word, whatever it is, any format it's in, it won't edit anything. So, like, you'll open it and it just doesn't open, though, like when you open it through PC Recruiter? It opens the resume, and then I hit edit, and it will open it again, But I can't erase any information. Okay. I can't change anything. So when you open it in Word, do you see a banner up at the top that says, like, enable editing? Let me open one now. So when I open it at the top, there's nothing except a pencil in the left-hand corner. Like when you click the pencil? Okay, when I click the pencil, it says, let me see. So it's opening up in Word. And it's taking a lot longer to open it these days for some reason. Processing. Okay, and then when it opens, it changes it into a funky format where instead of looking at one page, scrolling down, it's got three pages side by side. And I go in to erase the address, and I can highlight it, but it will not erase. Okay, so it sounds like that's an issue with how the resume came over to you. Because a lot of times resumes, they'll have like frames and headers where you can't edit the text of the header. You can only delete the header. If you right-click on it, like where the address is, does it give you like an edit or delete header option? No. I'm telling you something I did yesterday because I do this every single day and I've tried it with six different resumes and I can't do it with anything there's something in these settings that I accidentally messed up and I don't know what it is because I'm not a programmer yeah I'm trying to take a look because if you can't edit it in word it's definitely a word just setting so I'm just trying to see what you might have done here I'm taking a look at my word now let me pull mine up here So I got to come over. Do you have time to hop on a quick screen share so I can see what you're seeing with those resumes? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Let me start up a video meeting here. What's a good email address for you? Info, I-N-F-O, at toptalentrecruiter.com. All right. Just sent that meeting link on over to you. It's good to hear in just a second. All right. All right. If you see a box asking to connect video and audio, you can just exit out of it. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of that meeting window that says share. It says can't access microphone. You can just . Okay. All right, there it is. And then you'll want to share the entire screen. Well, choose what share with RingCentral, and I'm selecting the tab to share, but it's not doing anything. So you'll want to share the entire screen. Like under entire screen you'll click on which screen you want to share. And then you'll highlight and then you'll click share again in the pop out box. So go ahead and minimize RingCentral. Alright, let's pop into PC Recruiter here. And then go ahead and click the pencil to edit it. And used to when I clicked the pencil, it brought the resume up in the exact same format you see right there on Robert's resume. Watch what it does now. And it does every resume like this. And it never did this kind of format before. Go ahead and click the X over on the right where it says the feedback from Microsoft. Go to file up at the top. Just trying to see... word is in some kind of weird format here go to where it says options down at the very bottom and then display options I'm just making sure mine are the same. Go up to general for me. Those all look the same. Go ahead and exit out of this. Then exit out of Word. Go to your search bar just down at the very bottom. Just type in Word and open up that Word app. Yeah, I want to see what... just do like a blank document. I want to see how it pops up here. Man, that's odd. Is there something to do up h...
