## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Rick Wolf. Hi. Hi. How are you? Okay. Thanks. And you? Oh, pretty good. Happy Monday. You too. Hey, just a real simple question. I keep on getting this rounded look bulletin when I log on to my PCR and I put a checkmark in don't show me this guide in the future and skip. And every time I sign on, it still shows it to me. How do I? Do you know, are you clearing cache often or upon exit? Because a setting like that is remembered in cache. And that could be why it's not remembering it. I don't know how to do that. So if you can teach me how to clear it afterwards, that would be great. Well, clearing it is what could be making it return back. sometimes people have their browser set where they clear cache upon exit and if you do that then that's why some settings are remembered um let me remember where that setting is because I never use it I only occasionally clear my cache one second you're using chrome right no I'm using edge okay okay let me follow I had a Google to stop especially it was if it's out to I don't use that let me make sure these instructions are right before I take you through the steps Okay, so that would be that and I'm looking for this window so it's telling me to go there. Okay. It might be this. Okay. Open up Edge. Yep. And then go to Settings. Yep. And then go where it says Privacy Search and Services. We've got privacy and security online. Hold on a minute. It will be over at the left. I'm going to type in privacy and see what happens. Account privacy settings? Is that what I'm? Possibly. Possibly, unless you have an older version of Edge. No, I think it's current. Yeah, when you go to those three horizontal dots at the top right of your Edge, then you went down to Settings, right? No. No, I'm doing that. Okay. I typed Settings. Yeah. Okay. Do you see Privacy Search and Securities? One minute, let's see. My screen went tiny on me. Okay. So I'm looking for privacy search and services. Okay, got that. Okay. And then click where it says clear browsing data. Okay. And click on where it says choose what to clear every time you close your browser. Do you have anything selected? Do you have cached images? What about cached images and files? That's not checked. So we can check that. Okay. Well, now that one I was thinking you'd want off. That's the one I was thinking that you'd want off. Yeah, that was off. Okay. So when you get that pop-up, you are checking the box? Which box are we talking about? The one that says rounded look. Yeah. I'm checking there. There's like a little touch. Yeah, so you are doing that? Don't show it to me again. Because that should be. And then it says skip. Yeah, that should be remembering it as long as you have, like if you were to clear your cash. then it would pop up again because your cache is remembering. One thing that cache is doing is remembering things about a site. I wonder if it is under the cookies then. I don't know. Where do we find them out? I don't know on that one. Let me ask on that one. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Here's what we could try. Sure. Where it says cookies and other site data, turn that one off. Where do I find that? Instead of privacy search and services. Yeah, and where you go down to where it says choose what to clear every time. Choose what to clear every time. The area we were just in. So you went to privacy search and services. then you went to clear browsing data and then choose what to clear every time you close the browser so I'm in delete browsing data and then it says time range that's a different area so you needed to be under where it said choose what to clear every time you close oh I see it excuse me a minute I had to sneeze I'm sorry choose what to clear every time you close the browser okay yeah if it's not remembering it sounds like something's being cleared every time you close your browser that's making it keep popping up okay so when you go to what Choose what to clear every time you close your browser. What is turned on? Cookies and other site data. Okay, let's turn that one off. Okay. Okay, now I'm going to have to have you probably log in a couple times now just to confirm if this was it. Okay. Go out of Peace Recruiter and then log in. Once you turn this setting off, hit the back so that way it's remembered. Yeah, I did that. okay now log into PC recruiter and try doing that same thing where if when that pops up to turn it off like don't show me this again with that checkbox selected Okay, so it's got the rounded look back again. So now I'm going to click on do not show this guide in the future. And then hit skip. Skip. Okay. And then just click something as if you're going to do something. Okay. Okay. Now let's leave PCR again. Mean X out of it? Mm-hmm. Close it? Yes. So what I'm thinking is with that setting before, it might be clearing out that you set that. So that might be why it was popping up again. So let's have you log back in again. I've got s...
