## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling CFC. This is Danielle speaking. How may I help you? Hi, Danielle. I did not mean to call you Cindy. Oh, no worries. How did you send that message? I'm just curious. If this is like our help desk system where maybe we had a different name or how you sent the message that maybe we have to fix your display name. So there have actually been a variety of different people who have sat in that seat. I'm surprised it didn't say Billy. I'm surprised it said Cindy. Sometimes that name pops up. Sometimes Billy pops up. I get called a lot of things. I'm not worried about it. Is it just when it's with us, though? No, no. Okay. Whatever reason, that email address just has weird, has like the last couple of names like ghosted onto it, I guess. Well, we do have a, you know what, this might be us. Okay. Because it does say Cindy Duffy. That's what I, I'm just going to change this to your name. She was the bookkeeper here a long, long time ago, probably about seven years ago when I first started. And then Mary DeLuca was for a while, and then Billy's been in it off and on because she still works here and she does it sometimes. But right now it's both of me. All right. So in case it was our help desk, that gender and display name, because we do have that email address in our help desk, that way I'm going to change that to you. That has nothing to do with the billing. These are all different sites, which is why I think it's so darn confusing. Okay. All right. So that is now going to reflect your name. Excellent. Let me make sure. Oh, no, I've got to change it down here too. Okay. Danielle. And then save. Okay. All right, we've got it at least tied to you. If it was, the help desk doing it. Okay, perfect. Okay, so going back, I sent a flood of emails, and I'm really sorry about the bad email. I don't know what happened there. Did I work with you guys at some point? So the problem is. I couldn't tell you. Chris honestly has been, I don't know how long this transition has been going on. Chris told me about it about two days ago, and then I got that email sent to me, and he didn't give me instructions on it. So I was like, I guess he's handling it. This is for my information. And then he was like, oh, I think that they're actually like you need to go in and do something. And that's when I responded to the email and was like, hey. I went in, logged in, made an account. I think I've got everything paid for. I got receipts for all those different invoices. So I believe everything should be good. Is there anything else that you need from me going forward? Let me see, because I wanted to tell you about the customer portal where you can actually go in and see your invoices and everything. Yes, I think I did that. Okay. Oh, and you even did this. Okay, because that one I backed. Okay, so that one, ABL. so then the upgrade invoice is paid as well okay so I'm going to get that upgrade moving forward and I did update the address I think all of our systems are separate you're at Discovery Boulevard now right yes that's correct okay so all of those at least the open ones I think I only bothered with the open ones I updated those but I also set your recurring and your customer account to all have the new address so we should be good and I apologize for this again when you work different systems actually so let me make sure what we have over here for you and we also maintain PC recruiter for just like when you guys call in and that stuff let me see what we got over there for you guys Help me, APL factoring, did I update it yet over here? Discovery Boulevard, okay, yeah, I did do that one too. Okay, so we have it, everything all updated now. And we should be good. Okay, I'm going to make sure I have your email address over here. I set up the auto pay as well, so hopefully, although it says it must be accepted by the same person on this, so I guess Chris needs to accept the auto pay. Oh, how did you create the account? I created it with my email address, the ACCT one. I wonder if it has to match the name that we do it, or does it want the name of your card? What's the name on the card? It's probably going to be Chris's written name. Okay. So that did not accept his name either. OK, I wonder if I have to have a name. OK, let me try this. I'm going to just put his name even though it's account, that email address. I'm going to put his name. Maybe it wants to, because your first name and last name are blank. So let me try adding something in there on the customer account. This system is a little different, so it's still working out different things. Try typing Chris Raines now. That did not work either. I'm wondering if where I put name, I put like you gave the card a name, maybe that's what it's meaning. It could be the card name. All right. Let's try that then. It might be one of those things that wants zip code to verify. No, it's not accepting that either. Okay. I could probably do it. I wonder if it wants David's name. No...
