## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Oh, hi, Tyler. This is Lynn Watson with Seeking Alpha Search in Birmingham. Yeah, on my Outlook, I'm getting the license expired notice. Yeah, let me grab that serial number. I just have to have someone clear that out for you here real quick. So while you're doing that, I have a question. And so to get support, like online support, is it pcrecruiter.net? Is it .com? It's .net. Or you can just always email support at mainsequence.net. Okay. Yeah, so I kind of feel like I've been out of the loop for a while. I've had a medical situation, but I'm getting back into recruiting. so I've kind of missed what you guys have done recently as far as updates so I'm wondering what y'all have done as far as do you have any AI anything new with AI and yes we do have some AI search tools so and some other AI tools within the database if you go to your PC recruiter login page and you'll see that we have that what's new section that'll give you some articles on kind of all the stuff we've been up to okay so do you have anything new as far as integration with LinkedIn and you know when you post on the job boards having your candidates come directly into the system? So we've always had that with the job board where if they apply through your website and you're if you're using the PC Recruiter job board or a third-party job board that you've integrated in your website with PC Recruiter that they'll come straight into the database. With LinkedIn we only offer a capture tool really that we've had for a while just because LinkedIn doesn't partner with a lot of people. They want you to use just their products. So we don't have any direct integrations with LinkedIn. Oh, okay. All right. So with my website, I was with management recruiters and they did my website when I first bought the franchise. And then when they went private a few years ago, I left because they're no longer a publicly traded company. And so with my website, I had a way to post online, but it was through a link that they provided. So I don't know if I have that. I don't know how that set up recently as far as doing a job posting with my website and how that might be able to be linked into PC Recruiter. So what you could do, you can always reach out to your account representative, Jim Lombardo. So I'm not with management recruiters any longer. yes but Jim Lombardo is with PC Recruiter I'm sorry yes and tell him you are interested in getting the PC Recruiter job board as part of your package and then once that happens we can get you over with our webmaster drew and he can help you design the job board and give you all the stuff that you would need to put it into your website so that way the two are connected so that way you could post any jobs getting back yeah i'm just getting back into recruiting so i haven't actually paid for postings like through linkedin recruiter or through monster career builder that sort of thing um so i don't know do i have to have the paid job board where i post to be able to use that are there any free no so this one is just this one would just be specifically like for the job board on your website oh okay okay Okay. I need a new website. It's dated. It wasn't great when I first got it with management recruiters, but now it's very dated. Yeah. Drew might actually be able to point you in the right direction for that, too. He knows quite a few people in the industry. Okay. All right. but it looks like the person that's supposed to clear that for me might be at lunch for the portal license, but it should. Let me just double check. If someone else is available real quick. message someone directly here see if they Well, how about this so I don't waste too much of your time here. What's a good number to give you a call back in? I can call you back as soon as that portal license is cleared out. Oh, sure. Yeah, it's 205-602-4888. Perfect. Yeah, I'll give you a call back as soon as that's cleared out here, just so you have the confirmation. And I don't need too much of your time waiting on hold here. Sure, that's fine. Sorry, I didn't catch who I'm talking to. Tyler. Oh, hey, Tyler. Okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yep, no problem. Talk to you soon. All right. Have a good day. You too. Bye....
