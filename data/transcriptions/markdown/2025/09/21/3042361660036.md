## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Giselle with the Newport Group. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Thank you. I just have a quick question. So if we use RingCentral and recently one of the recruiters, their RingCentral got disconnected from PCR, I think it happened this week or late last week, and then we just reconnected it today when we realized. Will the activities repopulate for those days that it wasn't connected? Yes, it'll kind of retroactively look at the RingCentral call queue. I think it's what it's called over at RingCentral, and then just make a match over in PCR activities. Gotcha. Okay, awesome. All right, I think that's about it. Yeah, I just wanted to make sure, like, I didn't have to do anything in the system to bring those activities back. But, okay, sweet. Thanks so much. I think that'll be all today. Thank you. Awesome. Sounds good. Reach out if you need anything else. Thank you. Have a great day. Bye-bye. You too....
