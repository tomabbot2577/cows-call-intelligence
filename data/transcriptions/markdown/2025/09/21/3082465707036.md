## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Teresa, and I'm with World Bridge Partners in Omaha, Nebraska. I actually just hung up the phone with somebody, and I guess I should have tested it before we hung up. We have Zoom phone, and he just supposedly launched it for one of our databases that was not connected, but I still cannot get it connected. Okay, and I'm sorry, what is your name? My name is Teresa. I'm with World Bridge Partners of Omaha. Teresa Hale? Yes. Okay, let's see. I'll pull up my information on that stuff because I have not done that. You're doing the Zoom phone integration, right? Right. Okay. Thank you. Maybe I have to read through the stuff because I haven't really done this one much. I have too many customers using it yet. Okay, which database are you in? Omaha, Maine. And what is your username? Mine is TLH. TLH, okay. Initial authentication of Zoom with impairments will be done twice for each user. Okay, let me see here. Okay. You're not currently logged into Zoom. Click the link below to authenticate. Okay. Can you do me a favor and go to system? under in the main tool yeah in the in peace recruiter on the main toolbar go to system okay and go to users oh you know what I'm not logged in as me I'm logged in as Chris maybe that's the problem yeah yeah try logging in because you're trying to set it up for yourself right no I'm trying to set it up for another user what is the user you're trying to set it up for cmc okay but he does not have admin privileges okay so you'll have to log in as yourself okay and of course i don't know what my password is um i'm at his computer let's see can i do it from my desk or do i need to be at his computer You could do it either way. You just got to be logged in as yourself because it looks like there is a step that you have to do similar to a RingCentral setup that you have to do as an administrator. Okay, hang on. Let me get back to my desk. Okay, I am here. I am logging in. Actually, before you do that, because there is a little note, just to make sure that it doesn't recognize your own login, do you use Chrome? Yes. Okay, open Chrome in incognito window, which basically means if you're logged into your Zoom account, It won't try to recognize you, that you'll actually be prompted for their credentials. So if you have the Chrome option at the very bottom of your computer, usually if you right-click, it's the incognito window. Okay. So log into Peace Recruiter in incognito through Chrome, but as yourself. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, so you're going to go to System on the main toolbar. Okay. Then go to Users. All right. Click Manage Users. Okay. And then click on the username CMC. Okay. Next to the contact phone field, click the gear icon. Next to the contact, say that one more time. So once you click on the CMC username, underneath full name, you'll see the contact phone field. Click the gear icon just to the right of that. Oh, there we go. Okay. Zoom. Zoom. And then see where it says authenticate? But you'll need to sign in as him. Okay. And his email address. I'll put you on speakerphone so I can type. Okay. See, let's put in his email address. Oh, come on. B-M-C. What's this? And I'm going to send you these detailed instructions. It looks like they put the serial code in, but it didn't do the other stuff. All right, this happened to me before. it says application not found should pop up a window now let me try it again Zoom, authenticate. We had this issue before when we, oh, third party cookies blocked. That's why. So let me turn this on. Now let's see. Allowed. Sam authenticate. Still not doing it. You allowed third party cookies in the site. When I click on authenticate, it keeps telling me application is not found. Okay. Hold on a second. Let's do a screen share. I'm going to send you a meeting link. I'm a little stumped here. I may think start an instant. Oh, wait a minute. Let's see. I'm looking to see if there's anything I may be overlooking. Is it a paid Zoom account? Yes. Okay. I sent you a link to join a screen share. On my email? Yeah. Okay. I clicked on the link and it took me to a help screen. Learning Center? Today. Oh, there should be another email coming in. Oh, gotcha. That was the one with just the instructions. I'm trying to walk you through, but we're not getting very far. Sorry, that's really weird. One went to that and one went to junk mail. Oh. Did I hit the wrong thing? I must have hit the wrong thing. Good grief. Meet.google, right? Yeah. There we go. Now, when you go to join it, you don't need to use the camera or audio. since we don't need to see faces. We want to watch the screen, but we're also already on the phone. Right. Otherwise, we get a lot of background noise too. Where it says join call, I clicked on that link. Okay. And it might be asking you about... Oh, you know what? I got to move it. It's not allowing me to do anything. I got to move it out of junk mail. God, I hate this thing. I hate...
