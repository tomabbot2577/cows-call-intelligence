## 💬 Full Transcript

 Oh, thank God. Hi. How are you? I actually have... I don't want to cry. Can't be crying. Well, here's the deal. I'm a technical idiot, and they always give me these step-by-step things. This time, all I needed to do was, when I'm setting up follow-up in PC Recruiter, it wasn't going to my calendar. So I tried to do it. I actually have Outlook open now, but my Outlook doesn't work anymore. It only works PC Recruiter. It has a PC Recruiter portal. And for me to send an email, I can't send an email unless I use PC Recruiter. I don't know what's going on. I need it removed. I don't know either. I'm never going to do it again. I'm never doing it again. Now, it might be just updated or something. It might be something so simple. Let's just figure it out. Okay. Okay. can you get an email or no not at all um you can try it i don't know i finally got it open and it keeps saying that the license they gave me was expired oh let me pull up my computer but then when you open up outlook it has file pc recruiter home but it doesn't operate as my outlook anymore hold on one second let me get my other if i go to home okay there i go to home and it did it okay i just need to play with it more. I still want you to look at it, and if you would finish setting that for me. Hold on one second. Let me, because if it's expired, it might just be like you had a... I even said to Garrett, I said, will you please just do it for me? It never goes well. Here's the step. Okay, let me see. Let me pull up my old computer, because I don't have the... The portal licensing is a little strange. Like, it tracks like a connection, and then if you do too many, then it says it's expired. So it's in this other app that I have to use. I don't even know how to use it with PC Recruit. All I needed was when I set up something to follow up, I just needed that to tag into my thing. I probably am not even going to use it now because it just scared me enough that I'm... It probably just needs to be cleared and possibly even updated, but we'll find out. Don't be scared. Probably a quick little fix. Let me just check the link. You know what? I'm an old, old lady, and I need an IT department just for me, and I don't know what I'm going to do. I need to be trained on this, and I haven't figured out the training because it's like I use it. I need to use PC Recruiter more, but I just keep going back to LinkedIn, and I'm thinking about just paying the $8,000 to do the Recruiter on it because I've used it for years. everything I need there and I can just calendar through Outlook. But I went back in PC Recruiter just trying to find where my follow-ups were and couldn't find them. So it's simple little things. Yeah, if it's not connecting, then that's why they wouldn't be showing up over there. So bear with me one second. I'm going to have to cloud that licensing. I'm glad I got you, by the way. You're always so kind. Ah, thank you. I love Garrett, too, but he doesn't understand who he's dealing with. And Jason doesn't even return my calls anymore. I'm like, okay, I need some more training. You know, I'll buy it. I'm fine. I'll buy it. Nope, no phone calls. Really? Oh, I'm a train wreck. I'm an absolute train wreck. I don't blame him. You know, we paid the $500, and, you know, we were doing all this training without a CRM. So then I was talking to the sales guy. I can't think of his name right now. You know, and I said, I need more training. you know well here's what we'll do for you we got more training and I still wasn't in the place you know to so I could work with it every day but but then you know just out of the blue I needed Jason for you know I was told you know do you have any fee agreements do what do you have in the letters and stuff oh I have things for you we can you know an application you can use let me get it ready for you and he did and he's just wonderful but I don't even know what are what you have at my fingertips to even know what I could use and what needs to be loaded into my profile. Yeah, I don't know if we really do too much with the agreements because everybody has a different situation. So usually those are kind of... Well, I don't even know what I have at my fingertips. You know, I don't know what's there. But I will tell you that the video that, you know, on how to set it up, you know, said put it in Internet Explorer. And I'm like, okay, well, is an Internet Explorer dead and gone? Yeah. Yeah. And the video I was sent to set this up last week had, you know, open your Internet Explorer toolbar. And I'm like, okay, well, let's just try it in Chrome. That worked. And then I put the license in and it said it's expired. Okay, let's see. And then it froze. It just locked my Outlook. So I did the, you know, that, okay, let's just shut it down and come back up. So that got me stopped from crying. Don't cry. You're not going to cry. We're just going to fix it. I'm just such an idiot, and I can't ever quit working, and I need to make money, and ...
