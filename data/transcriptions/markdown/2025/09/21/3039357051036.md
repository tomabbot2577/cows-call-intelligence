## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi. Hi, this is Robin. Hello. Hi, this is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hi, this is Stacy American. So thank you for your email. So I just right now writing email to you. So if you want quickly payment, do you accept credit card payment? Yes. And that invoice that you would have received from our newer system, it comes from billing at mainsequence.net. there should be a view and pay option in that invoice. And when you click on it, you could put in your card details and enroll in auto pay, and then it's back to being on auto pay just like it was in our old system. We just couldn't move, like, card information over for security. Like, you have to reenter it in our new system. But if you use that view and pay option in the invoice, that will take care of it for you. For example, I see here, business name and card. So, does you charge the fee if we pay credit card? Well, that late fee was on there. Yeah, you already took off the fee. I took that off. Yeah, I see. I didn't see. So, regular depends. Some companies, they charge for the credit card fee. I don't know, 1%, 2%, 3%. For this fee, for the credit card fee, do you charge? That would be up to your bank. I believe we have to take the hit, I think. I don't know if your bank would do. No, for the credit card. For the credit card. Depends. No? Okay. Yeah. So also, like our history, I always pay the ACH by ACH, regular. So for ACH payment, our ACH, so for next schedule for the payment, will be this end of this week, Friday or next Monday. So when I pay you next business, you will get the payment. So if you need to pay by ACH or card, how are you needing to do that? So, yeah, before, for our history, I always pay by ACH. so so if you pay by ACH we would need to send you new details because that has also changed oh oh this changed too oh I see yeah then I think I think maybe I I paid credit card maybe it's better what do you think right yeah that's certainly easier we prefer hard because it can just be automatically done and then we don't have to have you know all these people doing all these billing issues, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Payments and wires and then going and having to apply it to the account. We definitely prefer credit card. It's just a lot easier to maintain. Okay. Also, if you don't charge a fee, I will pay by this one. Yeah, we don't add anything extra that I know of. So that would be out of the bank. Yeah, because we pay a max. We pay a max. So regular doesn't charge us. So it just depends on vendors. So this is why I make sure. So maybe I want to pay this. If I pay, if I can pay for the credit card, I just pay today. So quickly you can get. Yeah. Yeah. So if you just have you and pay, and then as you do it, you could pay like all four invoices that are open. And then your next invoice, which would be September 1st, that one would just automatically pay. But you would have to go in and do these four. Okay. So for September, we'd be automatically pay. Okay. Right. So, yeah, once I put my credit card, so our company's credit card in the information, right, in this website, right? Right. So you're online. Yeah. Okay. Good. Good to know. Thank you very much for your information. You are welcome. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Because I was just waiting for the, oh, is this email? Because before, there's a quick book. I can't respond. If I send an email, it doesn't go through. so this is why I can't get so yeah but those costs every month accrued our cost I just waiting for invoice thank you no problem thank you have a great week you too have a great week too thank you bye...
