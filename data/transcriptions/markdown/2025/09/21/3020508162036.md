So I just thought I'd call you directly. My email, I emailed all morning. This is when it's coming from PCR, like if I'm trying to send just a regular email from PCR to a candidate or a hiring manager, or if I'm trying to send a form letter. And it keeps popping up this. I rebooted, and then I had a test from my – now, my Gmail works, but obviously, I can't always just go into my Gmail. Well, my Gmail works fine, but obviously, so it's in PCR. It says, and then I had my team test it from internal. I can't email them back, but they can email me. It says, uh-oh, PC recruiter could not connect to your outgoing email server. Please check system, carrot, email setup, carrot, email alias list to verify your SMTP server settings and passwords. I emailed all day yesterday. So this happened about three times about a half hour ago. And my IP, kind of my internal teammate who's an IT genius was like, you need to reach out to them. I can't help you. So. And it's Christy Burgess. And I will tell you. Are you using the Alexander Raymond email when you're trying to send? Fry. The financial recruiters one. I'm not using Alexander Raymond.
