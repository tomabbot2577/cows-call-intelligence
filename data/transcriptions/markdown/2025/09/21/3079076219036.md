## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good morning, this is Chris. Hi Chris, this is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Hi Robin, how are you? I am good. Okay, so you need a new card. Yeah, let me turn auto-pay off for this so I can delete this one and then redo it. Okay, so update that. Bear with me one second, I know I talked to myself. That's fine. Okay, so we're going to delete this card. Okay. So new card, what is the name on the card? Christopher Lutz. Okay. And the card number? 4246-3153-7013-1391. And the expiration month and year? 0628. Okay. And the security number on the back? 326. And then is this the correct address associated with the card? 1601 Walnut Court, Fort Pierce, Florida, 34949? Yes. Okay. We'll add that in. perfect okay all right let's see so there was an invoice for 8866 and then the on hold one for September okay okay so I'm going to try reprocessing both of these and then it takes a moment for me to tell if it actually went through. No problem. It's queued up. Once it does go through, basically what it does is it sends you a receipt. Do you want me to just let you know if it doesn't go through? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. All right. I will, you know, I'll call you back. Yeah. Well, we'll get in touch if there's a problem, but you should get a receipt. If you get a receipt, then, you know, it's good. Otherwise I'll call you. Sound good. Perfect. Yeah. Sounds great, Robin. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks. Bye. Bye-bye....
