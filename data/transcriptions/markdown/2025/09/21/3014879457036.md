## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSegment Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Chuck Draper. I'm at CDP Solutions or Management Recruiters of Quakertown. I was giving a call. I'm running some difficulty with my email through PCR. Sure. Let's look here. Yeah, so I'm going to pull up your database. But, yeah, what are you seeing with the issue? So when I go to, like, reply to a preexisting email, it just comes up with this tiny little small box. Oh, okay. Yeah, we had a couple customers call in. So you'll have to clear your cache. I could give you those steps. But basically every time we push out – oh, go ahead. Let me just see if I can do that right now while I've got you on the phone. So I'm going down to – Yeah, so just go to the three dots at the top right of your browser. Go to More Tools towards the bottom. Okay, yep. And then Developer Tools. And that will open up some, you know, coding and stuff that you can ignore. And then right-click on – Here's a different way. Okay, this way I think will work better. Okay. Some of the just regular clear history stuff doesn't usually cover it. But so, yeah, once those coding things open up, just ignore them. And then right-click on the refresh button up by your web address. It's that arrow in a loop icon. And then you can – Arrow in a loop. Oh, yeah. It's kind of – Right-click on it. Oh, yeah, if you right-click on it. Exactly. Go to empty cache and hard reload. Okay. And that'll slowly refresh your page and kind of clear your cache fully for that particular page. And then once that reloads, let's test to make sure that that fixed it. Okay. Did I need to do it on the email page, though? It didn't matter. I don't think it matters as long as you are on PCR doing that. But we could, you know, if that doesn't work, we could try doing it just on the email page. but usually that happens back to normal okay oh good okay thank you yeah if we just push out a little update some computers need that clearing cache um so we did a little update i think earlier this last week but okay uh reach out if you need anything else thank you i appreciate it thanks...
