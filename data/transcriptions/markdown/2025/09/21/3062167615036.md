## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. It's Josh. Hey, Josh. How are you? I'm doing okay. Just been on the phone nonstop. I got to bathe my dog before it gets too late because I got to go on a road trip. But I don't want all the hair flying everywhere, you know? Oh, for sure. For sure. Well, yeah, I'll be quick. I had wanted to kind of circle back and follow up. I was able to look into the training. I think you had your training left because I think you didn't ever use any of it, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, I did. So what we do, we are keeping that 10 hours. It's available, I've confirmed with the training team. So thus you don't need any more training. And since the system's already set up, I don't need to charge a setup because it's done. You've got training and you're already set up. So if you want to keep the PCRM, all I need to do is get a new agreement to bump you up from 60 to 70 per user per month, while still keeping you on a 12-month agreement. For the two users now, anytime if you want to add user, just let me know. But it's zero setup. It'd just be $10 more user a month, and then we can get you fully on the PCRM and get your training underway. You said for a 12-month agreement? Mm-hmm. That's what you're on. I mean, the reason why I'm doing $60 a month right now and not the $50 a month through SRA is because you are allowing me to do month-to-month and not be locked into a three-year agreement. You're not a three-year agreement. I had you as a one, I think. I don't know what – let me see. Well, I had spoken with you all about how I just – I didn't want to, and I'm still hesitant to agree to a long-term commitment. I like being month-to-month, and that's why I'm paying extra and not going through the SRA discount because I'm a part of SRA. Okay. Yeah. So, I mean, I'm fine with increasing it $10 a month. I'm curious, what are the SRA rates right now? Is it still at 50? 50. Yeah, 50. Or 60 if they want the PCRM. Okay. Oh, actually, no, you are right. I'm looking at the agreement now. It is February 2022 to March 2022. So you are in a month-to-month. I looked at the wrong thing. so you are month to month so i can keep that month to month just put you at 70 instead of 60 get your new agreement no setup you'll have the training ready to go when you are uh and then we can get you up and trained on the pcrm okay yeah that sounds good um and sorry y'all haven't heard back from laura i haven't heard back from her either honestly like she's been dealing with all that stuff and I feel for her and and I mean she might be a little mad at me because I jumped ahead of her but I told her I was going to do it like I don't like she and she probably either forgot or just whatever I don't know because we made an agreement for what I would pay her for the database over time and I guess she wasn't really wanting to agree I don't know I don't know like look it's it's really silly like just between you and me like just so silly she's like she thinks i'm gonna screw her over and and um and uh like i'm just all i'm just after her database and i'm like i don't think she understands that the database is really old and not useful i just wanted to get whatever last bit of blood i can out of it before it's completely gone i mean everything can be found online these days and she just doesn't get it because she hasn't been in the game for a long, long time. Whatever. If you hear from her, just let us know. We can't get a hold of her. We've tried and we have no avenue to do so. We're just waiting on her to get back with us. Send her our way if you can. Yeah. I'm trying. I'll go over and send over the new agreement. Once that's signed, I'll just reopen or put in a new ticket for the 10 hours, get the trainer in touch to get that underway. You're still two users right now? Uh-huh. And PCR, what does PCR, what does the M stand for? PCR, it's like a CRM, like a contact relationship management software. So it's PCR, and we kind of combined it there. Okay. Okay. I was just curious. Okay, cool. Yeah. Well, thanks so much, and I guess we'll chat later. Perfect. I'll talk to you next week. All right. Thanks, Tim. Bye. Thanks, Josh. Take care. Bye-bye....
