## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is Robin. How are you? Okay, Robin. I got on that system and I created an account and I went to the vault thing. Okay. And I don't know what the hell. I tried to put in the CVV code or whatever the hell it's called. Okay. It's on the front of the card because that's the only... I got a new card. That's what the problem was. Okay. So I guess that little thing changes the CVV code. Now, is it the same card number? Yes. Okay. So I think what happens is like when it's the same card number, you can only delete it and then re-add it. That way you're being prompted that someone's not just kind of changing it for you. Do you have the card? I can help you with this because it's still showing as, let me pull it up again, Sharp Solutions. it is still showing an expiration i mean you don't have anything due right now you're good for now that was more like a head dot maybe i should have worded it better um because i happen to notice in going through a list of people who's either card just expired yours it looks like it expired in july so when you make your next payment it won't go through what i can do if it's okay with you week I can delete the card out that we have that expires and then re-add it is that okay with you you have that card with you okay so let me delete this one yeah hold on just a minute I gotta go get it okay Okay. And the other thing I found, too, is if you have it set up for auto pay, you have to turn the auto pay off on the card first and then delete it. It's above my pay grade. Yeah, I got it. I got you. Don't worry. You just take care of the old man. I'll take care of you. Yes, I will take care of you. All right. Otherwise, I'm going to tell Bill Kubitschek next time I'm in Hawaii. I love Bill. He's crazy. Isn't he funny? Oh, my God. He's so funny. He's one of the best sales guys I've ever seen in my life. He's so funny. Yeah, he's been crazy. When he just laughs, I laugh. Like, he's got the most contagious laugh, I think. Yeah, yeah. He's such a good salesman that I've sold about 200 users licenses. Wow. The PC Recruiter over the years. Nice. I really appreciate that. So it's, yeah, I should have got compensation from Bill, but he told me to go pound sand. Let's see, where am I? Okay, you need the number? Yeah, I'm going to have to redo all of it because I deleted out the card. All right. What is the name on the card? Okay, the actual name on the card is Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N-G, sharp, S-H-A-R-P. Okay. And then the card number. It's the name of the card. And then it's 3767-328-280-21000. Okay. 3767-328. Gosh, I need to be on my bigger screen. I can't see numbers anymore. 328-8- Sorry. Let me start over. 3767-328-280-21000. Right. Okay. The expiration date? 7-30. Okay. That's what went wrong on the old card. Okay. And then the security number? This is in American Express, right? Yep. Okay. Tell me the number. So that should be the four-digit number at the front of the card. 5134. 5134. And what's your state? North Carolina. Okay. North Carolina. What's the zip code on the card? 2750. I'm sorry, what was that? 27502. 502. Okay. I don't think I need address, but I think it will require state, zip, and country. Okay. Add card. Now, do you want me to put this on auto pay for you, this card? Yeah. Okay. All right. Hey, you know, I have a question, and I don't know if you're the right person to answer it, But what I was thinking about doing was I was thinking about possibly selling my database to multiple people. Because I'm about at the end of, you know, the trail. And I'm not selling the business. I'm just going to sell the database, the information. Okay. you guys got any problem with that i so as far as i know what we would do is whatever price you arrange we don't really have anything to do with that that's all on you and then i believe you would um pay like a you would have to sign like a release form to give that data to somebody else and then there might be some charges if we had to get involved to move it over i think they're pretty minimal though they're not too bad um but we don't do anything like as far as the pricing of it that's completely whatever you arrange oh yeah yeah yeah it's really just the release of it it would have to be like if there's like a form that they would have you sign and then um the person that we're giving it to might have some cost to like if it's an existing customer things like that. Now, the one thing that we can't do, let's say they are a Peace Recruiter user, we can't take your data and merge it into their database because there's too many tables that would be unrelated. So it'd be like a separate database for that customer. And then they could do like a move between roll-ups, but you don't get like everything. So it'd have to be like a separate database. It can't really be fully merged into their database. How come you know all this stuff because i've been here 19 years interesting yeah i'm an old time okay and the reason when you think about there's a...
