## 💬 Full Transcript

 Corrective IT. This is Michael. Hi, Michael. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I apologize. I saw your email before I saw your voicemail. No worries. No worries. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing good thanks so much sorry we've been having these issues I apologize so here's what I think probably happened if you ever changed the billing email maybe at some point in our old system there was like a customer email but then there was like an email for the actual invoice but we switched billing systems I don't think it uses that one it's literally in the invoice it's like the customer so that could be what kind of led to it but yeah no worries I just um yeah and then of course if you were auto pay before that stuff's all encrypted we only have like the last four numbers so you have to like set up auto pay gotcha let me see um progressive it I'm guessing I did switch it to yours If we were auto-paid then it was paying from a credit card correct? Yeah I'm sure that's how we had it set up Yeah let's see, yep that's how it was so when we switched to the new system it couldn't use that card to process it anymore but then if we had the wrong customer email yeah they were all going to be Moses that's what was going on Yeah. How long ago did that switch over? We did it, like, sometime, like, in April. Okay. So it hasn't been terribly long. Okay. No, no. Okay, because I'm like, oh, man, have we not, like, paid for a year or something? No, no, no. It's not that bad. And it looks like you just paid the ones that were open. I see them showing it's paid now. Oh, really? Yeah. Did you add your card and do the auto-pay option? No. I mean, I've been getting this error message. Progressive IT. Let me make sure I put it in the right one. Pretty sure I did, yeah. Auto-pay off short payment method. Yeah, I followed the link that you shared in the email to us. okay it pulled that up and then I I see let me just pull back up or what did I email you guys was it that there were invoices open or that we just had a bad email for you currently multiple open invoices on your account okay and said that you had B. Moses as the billing email and it's bouncing back. Okay. Because there's a transaction that happened today. Okay. Okay. But I don't see it showing your card in there, though. Hold on one second. Let me see. Unless possibly y'all, maybe Scott, you know, I wonder, I don't know. Would you have sent us a bill? Let me see when these transactions happened. Because it's possible Scott may have just done an ACH or something. Oh. Let's see. AutoPay. Yeah, I don't see a stored card or anything. Let me go to one of these invoices. Okay, so the most recent one is this one. paid timeline oh I wonder if our bookkeeper possibly processed it automatically at 411 all right do you want to she might have kind of processed from the old system okay but we really want to have you set up in the new one yeah you happen to have okay that way now that we have the email right and then we'll get all that done okay yeah so i was getting the error message i sent you a screenshot of yeah you should be able to do that now because i made your email the primary email and took out the b moses but then i did add the s miller as a copy for the um for the receipt okay um you know and like they'll get a copy but you'll create the account. But what I can do is I can take your card information for you. Okay. And set it up for you. Okay. That'd be great. Okay. So let me do this. Add stored card. Okay. What is the name on the card? Scott A. Miller. A as in apple. Okay. And what is the card number? It is 37271377516600. Okay, I'm going to guess that's an American Express based on the format. It is. Okay, expiration? It is 1229. Okay, and then the security number, which on American express should be at the front right of the card. Yes, 3207. 3207. And then what is the address associated with the card, especially the zip code? Is it 75254? Gosh, it's let's see, 5220 Spring Valley Road. Okay, that's probably the address then. 75254, Is that what you had? Yeah, that's what it's coming up as, but I don't know if that's pulling really from the card. Yeah, that's right. 75254 should be correct. I'm just not in the office anymore, and I don't ever write that thing down anymore. Okay, so I have it. We're going to do an auto-pay based on the due date. So you should be getting your next invoice. Let me see. Progressive IT. your next one will be sent August 24th. So if you don't get like a receipt that it's like paid or if there's a problem, you know, let me know. And then maybe it's the zip code. We don't really know until we try to process it. It's not giving an error so far. So I think we're okay. Okay. And, and so you're going to set me up an account or do I still need to go in there and set up an account? You can, you would have to create the account if you want one, because you have to create the password that you can use. Okay. But what it does is it'll ...
