## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. My name's Jason. I was just working with the – I'm kind of the IT for a customer that uses VCR Recruiter. And he's having an odd issue, and he was told it's not normal, and I'm just trying to verify.

And he's like, it's not supposed to do that, supposedly, is what he was told. Yeah, it's only supposed to do that if you're navigating like away from a screen.
