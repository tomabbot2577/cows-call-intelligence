## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Robin, James from Cogent Resources. Hi, how are you? Good, you? Good. I've been traveling the last couple months and I tried to get your system to pay. Okay. And what the initial problem was I couldn't put Canada in there. Okay. Then you sent me a note that it was working. I went back in. It still wouldn't let me do it. But I did register as Ohio. Oh, yeah, that's not ideal. Can you check online? Because it looks like I can't get in either to the database now. To the database or the billing? Because that's something completely different. Yeah, the database. so I don't know if they put me in the lock or not or not no we didn't do that on yours yet let's see but anyway when I put Ohio they let me save it finally because I couldn't get anything to save before yeah you probably need I wonder if the invoice itself doesn't have the right criteria but then like in the billing portal then I'm now I don't think I was seeing it but then now I'm seeing hold on one second I got like a bunch of screens open I have to hold on one second okay did I write that hold on one second let me make sure I saved it otherwise I forget who I talked to and then I get in trouble for not writing activity okay okay look at that I'll be right back in a sec okay look at the thing I'll be right there anyway it's me Robin, you're still there? Yes. Okay. Okay. So what I just did is I had an email generated to you to – hold on a second. I'm going to do another one too as well. because I want to see. Yeah, but you did that to me last time and it still didn't work, eh? Yeah, I want to see it now. So let me do a... Do you have RingCentral or do you... No, actually, I'm at a cottage right now. I'm having a really hard time with internet. Okay. But I need to get this billing figured out because I get messages every week here. Okay. Can they not go ahead and... I'm going to do a Google Meet. Well, no, it's got the wrong – no, it's got to be changed on your site, I believe. Okay. Because it's part of the authentication on the card process. So let me do this. Let's see. Do a Google Meet meeting. I'm going to send you a meeting link because I want to see – I might have to fumble around with you there in the site. I don't think it's going to work because, like I said, I'm out of cottage and there's no limited internet access. Let's see if we can do it. But do you still have my old card and all the information on file? They could just charge me, couldn't they? Well, it's all through the new billing portal, so we need to just get this kind of fixed. Right, right. And how many months am I behind now? I only see one, I believe. Call the resource James Bonner. Invoices. There is only one. Okay. So the last time I called in, I talked to Wolf, and he used my old card, I guess. You talked to who? Was it Wolf, I think? no there's no email somebody now there's no one name will be see or let me see nobody started with a W anyway excuse me you anyway so as far as you know that the account has not been locked out then no okay that is definitely not locked up so it might be yours are you getting to the login screen and just not putting in your username password or are you not getting to the login page. I'm getting to the login screen and I'm getting my name and James and all that is there and I go to put the password in and it's telling me it's invalid. Yeah, so that'd be... Are you picking the correct database? Like which database do you log into? Yeah. Which database do you log into? I don't think I still have it up here. I'll just try. I'm not getting your email either. It's just my reception. So you're telling me even though I saved it with my company information or my credit card and my name because it's Ohio and I'm not in Ohio. It went through but that could possibly mess up. It may not. Did it go through? No, well the last one I see there's a payment. I don't know. There's currently an open one though so we need to get it worked out and if it's better that we just do when you're back in the office you know we can do that again an invoice you're saying for july is still outstanding right so was july paid or no no it's not paid july is not okay so july is not paid okay i'll have to do when i go back in the office then because um yeah because when you sent me the last email said here james go into this view and and I've definitely seen where I found it so we could try a different couple ways I'd rather it get done right the first time so that it gets accepted and there's no issues down the road so when you are back in the office you know just let me know and we can do a screen share then yeah okay because I couldn't find anything that dropped down for anything for Ontario at all or yeah it depends where you go you got to select the country first but yeah and i was trying to yeah and i was trying to like lately i'm like okay there's this way like it wouldn't if you went right to the invoice but then i was doing other things ...
