## 💬 Full Transcript

 It was too sunny out. Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, this is Ernie Bivona. We spoke earlier today about the mail issue I was having. Oh, yeah. Well, it's doing the same thing. And I was able to get it to open up, but it doesn't, it's hiding. So I don't know how to do that. It's the pop-ups that are kind of still appearing weird or not popping up completely? Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, and I just put this person's email in, and then it just disappeared. So I was going to show you on this particular candidate, but I can't do that. I mean, the whole screen seems to be a little bit too big. I'm not sure how I can – it's not fitting the computer screen. Okay. Okay. Here, yeah, let's do a screen share, and then I'll get a better sense of what you're looking at. If you just want to go to a new tab in your browser, and then go to meetings.ringcentral.com. And that's meetings plural, so meetings.ringcentral.com. meetings yeah meetings period meetings period ring central dot com okay join meeting perfect and I can give you that meeting ID whenever you're ready yeah I'm ready Okay, that's 117-958-042. Join. Cool. I see you joined there. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio. It's already on the phone. Use your microphone. Use your camera. What am I doing here? Can I allow all this time? Yeah, you can hit allow, but we won't turn it all on. It'll be just allowed, I guess, but not used. Okay. And then... Join audio. by computer or without computer? Can you hear all the noise? Continue without audio. No, I can't hear any noise. Cannot. Okay. All right. And then once you continue without audio, you should see a blue share button down at the bottom of that RingCentral meeting. Click on that and select your entire screen up at the top. it'll say entire screen and then you could choose if you have multiple screens or just click screen one you just have one screen okay i did yeah and then hit share this should be yeah where's share um it might be at the bottom right so if you hit um Here, let me try to do it. It's not lit up. Oh, you'll have to click on screen one to kind of highlight it and select it first. Then you can hit the blue share button. Okay. There you go. There we go. I can see that. Okay. So, perfect. I can see RingCentral pulled up. Go ahead and open back up PCR. It might be kind of hiding behind this screen if you want to minimize it way up at the top. Where do you want me to go? You could minimize this screen and then we could take a look at PCR. You might have that open somewhere. Let's see. There we go. Click on that one. Okay. The problem is this guy, I saved his email address, but it's gone. I don't know where it went. Oh, okay. I thought it was somebody else. It's missing. Let me see if I can find it. I don't know how I can go to – just so I can duplicate exactly where he was. It was this guy. But I'm not sure. This is crazy. There was another screen that was able to... Let's go to somebody else because I can't figure out how to get to the other... You know what? We could check Bill's changelog is what it's called. And we could see if there's an email address that got changed to a blank. but it was there before. Maybe it's in the change log. So, yeah, let's check that. Click on Bill's name again. And then in that bar where it says edit name, resume, interviews, all the way to the right, click on the three horizontal lines. You're right there. Perfect. And now I got the candidate from your line. Hold on a second. Hopefully. Hopefully. Maria we're on I'm on another call now so we're there for 20 minutes I don't know what happened Maria hello Maria I'm on another call now you're waiting for 20 minutes and We can do the call tomorrow. Maria? Maria? Oh, shoot. Are you still there? Can you hear me all right? I can. Yeah, I don't know what happened to her. She didn't join the meeting. She called and I said, we'll do it tomorrow, but I still didn't hear. I think we're getting a lot of bad roll-up notes, attachment. Yeah, so click on the three horizontal lines to the right there. Details? No, farther to the right. You just had the three horizontal lines clicked on right there. Click on that and then go to change log. It's kind of on the left. It's in the third column. There we go. Okay, so this would show you if a record had a value. and then it was changed to something else. So if it had an email address, then maybe it was removed. But it doesn't look like it saved anything for Bill. Do you have any other examples? No. Let's see what this one does. Let's see. If I go make a call here. This? See that? Oh, okay. I see what you're doing. There's what it's showing you there. Okay. Okay. So if you... And sometimes I can do something that brings it up, but other times it just, I don't know what I do, but all of a sudden the whole screen comes up. That is weird. If you put your cursor in there and start typing, does it go change ...
