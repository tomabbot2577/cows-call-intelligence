## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Good morning. This is Gina with J. Powers. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. Hey, I have a question, and maybe you can show me how to do it. So I've been doing some researching, and I came across two companies in my database that is, it's worded differently, but it's the same company. And there's about 41 names in that company. And I want to find out how can I, first of all, merge these two companies and then in that way the 41 are in that company that I want them to be. and it's very tricky. I know how to merge it, but because one, the first company says Valley Water District, Santa Clara, and then the company that I want to merge it into is Santa Clara Valley Water. So it's kind of like, okay, the first letter is so different. So I'm at loss and I'm not so sure how to do it. Okay. So I would put each of those records onto a new company roll-up so that you can have them side by side to merge. So do you know how to add records to a roll-up? So create a new roll-up first, like a dumpster roll-up, something like that? Sure. Yeah, you can name it whatever you want. And we'll just add each of those companies on to the company rollout. OK, maybe you can walk me through. I just want to make sure that I'm doing it correctly. Sure. Do you want to do this on a screen share? Sure. Yeah. OK. Yeah. All right. Let me just open up a meeting here. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meeting ID? The ID is 367-560-883. Okay. All right, I see you there. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then just click the blue share button at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Perfect. Okay, can you see it? Yes. So if we go back to PCR in the main browser. Yeah, this too here. So this is the correct company because I checked their website and it says Santa Clara Valley Water. Okay, perfect. And then I have this, Valley Water, which is the same logo, and then this one. So I want everybody on Valley Water to go to here, Santa Clara, Valley Water District. All right. So go ahead and open up Santa Clara Valley Water District. And in the bottom frame, go to your action menu at the top right, the three horizontal lines, the top right of the record. There you go. and then go to add to roll up, the second one down. Perfect. You could go to add roll up at the bottom right to create a new one temporarily here. We could delete this after. You can name this whatever you want just so we can get to it quickly. Perfect. Okay. And then hit save. And that one's been added, so you could close this pop-up window. And then open the other record, Valley of Water. There you go. And same thing, go to the top right in the action menu and add that one to the roll-up. And just click on the number one under Company for that new roll-up we created. Perfect. Awesome. You can close that and then go to Rollups in the main menu up at the top. And then click on the number two to open that company rollup. And then check the boxes next to each of those records on the left. And then at the top right, go to the Merge icon. Oh, actually, it's the icon right to the left of the three horizontal lines. It's the four arrows pointing at each other. There you go. Merge companies. Oh, yeah. And then check the box under the master column for the one you want to win out in the end in the merging process. Okay. And then hit merge and okay. So you'll be left with that one, the Santa Clara Valley Water District, and all the names will have been merged from both of those companies. Oh, okay. Perfect. Okie dokie. And then I can just go back and delete that roll up, this one here. Yeah, feel free to delete that. just hit the check box on the left and there's delete in the action menu at the top right. There you go and just type delete in that box there and you should be good to go. Okay right on perfect thank you very much. No problem anything else you've been having trouble with? Not right now, but of course I can always call back and bug you guys later. Yeah, just let us know. Okay, thank you. Have a nice day. You too. Bye....
