## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Yeah, I called in earlier. I've had a problem with the capture. We got that fixed. At least I can see the capture coming up now on LinkedIn. But when I click on it, nothing happens. LinkedIn's been having some issues today. I don't know if it's on their end or your end. But it's like there's certain features that are not working, and it's searching really slow. And I saw some reports that they have some outages. But it seems to be working now. There's certain features that don't work, but could you maybe troubleshoot and make sure that it's not on your end? Okay. Well, do you know who you worked with earlier? Oh, gosh. Garrett or Robin or perhaps Jason? God, I cannot remember. I remember it when he answered the phone and I can't think of it right now that was about maybe an hour and a half ago two hours ago alright I'll find out in my notes here give me one second let me pull you up it had been working I guess it was hooked up, but somehow it got switched off. The LinkedIn buttons got switched off. So are you using just a regular LinkedIn account, or do you pay for the LinkedIn account? No, I pay. It's Recruiter, the top version. Got it. Okay. It's appearing on LinkedIn Recruiter, and also when I go to the public profile, it appears both ways. So it's not an issue of not appearing on the LinkedIn profile. you just want to click it nothing happens okay so you do have the you know you just downloaded it today so you have like the most recent version i'm assuming um i'm not sure that it was already downloaded what you know i i think it was it was he checked it it was already there it wasn't like we had to reinstall it so maybe we need to i don't know if it's the current version or not okay um that could be potentially something but so i'm assuming he got you all or they i don't know if he or she got you all logged in and then that means when you open up a linkedin profile it the little badge appears on the right and you can click on it so when you click on the badge does anything happen or or just some fields don't pull to the it moves but then it disappears and nothing happens, and then it reappears. I just did it on this one guy, and it disappears for a second, and then it just reappears, and nothing happens. I don't get the window coming up with the options. Okay, and they're not captured. Like, it's not on basic mode where it's just auto-capturing, right? Is that still a capture function? Let me check my own. I don't know. If I click on the extension thing, I look at it, it says, it's in basic mode should it not be in basic mode oh oh is it in basic the basic mode toggle switches off is to the right and it is blue yes okay basic mode i believe um is like a mode of which it will just immediately inhale and it doesn't show you like the um the preliminary window that will allow you to edit. Oh, that's right. Okay, now what? If you want to see all the information before it enters the database, you have to turn basic mode off, and then you should be able to try that out. Oh, my goodness. Okay, that's what it was. Okay. Well, let me see if that works. Let me try it. Hopefully, that's all it is. You might want to just go verify the data on the ones that you basic imported. Yeah, because I saw people, and I've had, like, three copies of their profiles. I'm glad I caught that. Okay, we caught that. Now it's not coming. Now the – no. Okay, maybe I should restart it. Yeah, you might want to switch off and then, like, kind of refresh the tab. Yeah, okay. Let me do that. Okay. I'm sure that's what it was. This is my day for crap going on. Sorry. All right, I'm sorry about that. You know, it always starts with something. It was really slow today, so I went and started messing with the – long story. Anyway, I know enough to be dangerous. let's see here okay I'm glad we can get through that without like going through the whole yeah seems like that might be exactly what it was that's let me just go find a profile yeah no problem Let's look at that. Yep. That was a problem. Okay. You helped me, and it was easy. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. You know what? I don't know if I caught your name. Can I at least get your name so I can log back on? Oh, yeah. It's okay. Yeah, sorry about that. Scott Grillo. Yeah. Scott Grillo. Okay, that's probably good enough. You did have an activity earlier. Scott Grillo, yeah, G-R-I-L-O. All right, well, thank you so much, Scott. Have a good rest of your night. Thank you, too. Thanks. All right. Yeah....
