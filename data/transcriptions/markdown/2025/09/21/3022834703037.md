## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, Joe? Yeah. This is Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm pretty well. Just wanted to give a call. It was sent over here, your ticket that said you were looking to close your PC Recruiter account. I just wanted to kind of touch base and see why where you're going because we're probably going to be closing the doors and at the end here okay okay so not leaving for anything else nothing was going wrong or lacking for you well that's we're just the business has been really bad last year and a half so okay okay did you need the data return at all yeah that would be great if it could be sent to my email. Okay. Well, what they do, they email it to you in a downloadable format. There is, I think, a $175 cost to get it because my guys need to go and pull the data out, make it available, secure it on the link for download. And I can have them send you the form to fill out if you want to decide you want to do it. Yes, send it and I'll decide if I want to do it or not. Perfect. And then when did you want to officially cancel? End of this month or end of the year? What's best? End of this month. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. I'll go ahead and put that ticket in, and then my accounting team should be in touch as to next steps. And I wish you luck. If there's anything you need or ever back in the market, keep us in mind. Okay. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. All right. Bye now....
