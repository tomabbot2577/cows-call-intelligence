## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, how's it going, Garrett? It's Omar. I'm with Stanford Rose KBIC IT, and I need assistance with someone having an issue not receiving invoice emails from PCR. I have taken the steps of verifying that their email alias is signed in, and I did the test, test connection, and it was successful, but they're still not receiving emails, like the invoice test. We did emails to essentially replicate the issue, and she was still having the same issue. Okay. So the email alias is only for outgoing mail. You'll want to set up the mail server to have it monitor inbox and other things for the incoming setup. Are you signed in as that user currently on PCR? Yes, I have her on PCR. Oh, perfect. So at the top right, you'll want to go to the gear icon with the little drop-down menu. It's by the profile picture. and then select email, the first option in that drop-down menu. Okay. That'll open up PCR mail in a new tab. And then at the top left of PCR mail, go to configure, which is another gear icon. Okay. And then go to mail servers. Mail servers, okay. So that is where you would, in the bottom frame, either add a new one or edit the current one if there is one there. And this needs to be connected the same way, like if they have Microsoft, click on Sign In with Microsoft, or if they have Google, click on Sign In with Google. Okay, so I did do test connection, and it says authenticate complete. Oh, good, and there's a green lettering in the test there? Yeah. Okay, so that's the mail server side. So then did you map the folders? Do you know if they're mapped for the sent and trash folder at all? Okay, so I'm looking at email folders. Yeah, email folders up at the top center. And if you look down below, nothing under the personal heading that's at the very top, but they'll have the name of their mail server listed there. Below that, look for sent mail, deleted items, and they should have... I see it says it says system sent items system red items system inbox yeah and it says for personal I want to action delete or edit would I have to are you on are you on the left where it has the folder list or did you click email folders at the top center I clicked email folders at the top center and then And at the bottom, there's like another window tab thing that opened up that email folders. And that says I want to in one column. Right. OK. Column. It was folder name. I see. Yeah. So there'll be one called personal as like a grouping, like a personal heading. Below that, you'll have your next grouping or your next heading. That's probably going to be matching the name of your mail server. so below that within the mail server grouping look for your sent folder is there a sent folder in there yes but I only see yeah there's a whole bunch of folders here but I do see oh hold on sent items sent folder but I'm seeing I'm seeing under the personal cluster, I'm seeing sent items there. Yeah, that one there, you just ignore that one. We only care about the one under the other cluster. So the sent mail folder should say sent folder in parentheses next to it if they've been mapped to each other. Not under personal again, but yeah, under the other one. And then there should be like a trash or deleted items folder under there as well. And that should have deleted folder in parentheses next to it. Okay. Might be trash. It might be called deleted items. Yeah, she has a whole bunch of different folders here set up. So many of them. I only see sent items, but that's like from a different cluster, right? It's just like on its own. It says action, sent items, sent folder. That's the second one. The first one is under that very first cluster. It says personal inbox, read items, sent items, deleted items, block list, drafts. Yeah, so we don't need to adjust anything with the personal. It's only things below that. but yeah okay I see the I see that deleted items I see that I see that have a deleted folder to the right of that in parentheses yes okay so those look like they're mapped in so in her mail server it says sent mail sent folder and then deleted items deleted folders so those are good and then So you're saying that the inbox is not receiving emails here in PCR mail? Yes. So she is doing – I'm so sorry to say this, but I have no idea. She is trying to set up invoice emails, and whenever she does that, I don't quite recall how she did it, but she would do an invoice email, and then it would populate on her Outlook like she said it normally does. Oh, okay. Let's see. Someone's saying email alias is SMTP, just like you said, and then he's asking is she using PCR portal in Outlook or is she using PCR IMAP to collect mail? It looks like she's doing the PCR IMAP to collect mail. Right. since she's not doing it on the actual Outlook app. Right, yes. We were just looking at the PCR IMAP settings under Mail Server, and that's what's tested positively. The folders are ma...
