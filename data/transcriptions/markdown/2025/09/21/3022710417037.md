I'm just calling in to ask about how to add a new industry specialty on PCR. I did look into the Learning Center, but I didn't have any luck finding any information how to add some new ones. so that would be done under system okay and then you go to database setup database let me just find it oh i see update database would that be the same thing no no you'd have to um it'd be are you an administrator of the database yes yeah i'm on it now okay so once you go to the main server, database setup, and then you'll see industry specialty codes over at the right. I just clicked database setup, but it says zero. There's nothing listed under database setup. It could be your securities. You might not be a full administrator. so it means the administrator would have to do that gotcha okay i might have to contact our um operations manager then um okay i will get in touch with her first and then i think she might even know how to do it too um all right no worries then thank you but um yeah so it's database setup and then there should be like an industry industry specialty codes specialty codes okay gotcha all right thank you so much i will get in touch with her then thank you thank you...
