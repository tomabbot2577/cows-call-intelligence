## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. This is Kirk again. I've got a question for you. So we took all of our data and put it into Google Spreadsheets. How would that work as far as transferring our data into TCR? I don't know. Do you know if it can be pushed into a CSV? I do not know that. Hold on a minute. Was it Google or Excel? Oh, shit. I'm sure she said Google, but let me go back and ask her again. If it's a CSV, like a standard spreadsheet, that can be mapped in very easily anytime. If it's a Google Sheet, I don't know how you can get a Google Sheet into a CSV, but there might be a way. I'm asking one of my guys here as well. And do you guys integrate with Google? You said Outlook before. Yeah, Outlook and Google Mail as well. We have an overlay for Google Mail, and we also can integrate iMap with Google Mail so that your messages can be recorded in PC Recruiter and mapped to the correct record in the database. Okay. But you're usually – the last time I used the product was with Outlook. Yeah, it used to only go with Outlook, but it goes with Outlook and Gmail now. Okay. All right. So if I get it in CVC, CVS, whatever you call it, then it's definitely doable. Otherwise, I need – it's easier to do it. Excel spreadsheet is no problem, right? Mm-hmm. yeah it's if it can be a CSV you can import that very easily and if you get it from a Google sheet into a CSV no problem okay thanks I'll let me check on that all right...
