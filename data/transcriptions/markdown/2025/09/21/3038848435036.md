 technology this is garrett how may i help you yeah hi uh garrett this is merrill ruttman um and uh i need your help i um recently migrated from uh my old uh laptop to a new laptop and i um in the process have lost my um connection from a pc recruiter to outlook where i What I need to do is upload my Outlook emails into PC Recruiter, and I lost that connection. They're not uploading. Okay. So were you using our Outlook plug-in called the PCR Outlook Portal, where you were inside of Outlook and you were able to access PCR from inside of Outlook? Or was it just having PCR scan your incoming and outgoing mail so that it wrote the activities? Yes. It was bringing – it was – let me tell you what – hold on a second. Let me get this thing green here. If I'm in PCR and I go up and I click the wheel up there in the upper right-hand corner and then select email, what happens is it brings in the – it copies my inbox, my Outlook inbox, and brings them into the PCR email inbox. and automatically the mails get shoved down to the appropriate people, the appropriate contacts. Right. Right. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. So that's what I had, and I'd like to have that. It would also be nice if I would be able to send an email on Outlook and have that sent email shoved over to PCR. That would be convenient also. I haven't had that up to now. But it's really the former that I'm more concerned with and getting that back up. Awesome. So it looks like, let's see, right now you have your outgoing email inside of PCR has a positive connection when you test it. So that's good. So the incoming mail is, let's see, it's a POP3 setup here. It's showing that there's an invalid password. So if you want to go to configure at the top left of PCR mail. Okay. Let's see. PCR. I'm on the main screen here, the main screen of PCR, the home screen. Okay. So you'll want to get back to PCR mail where you clicked on that tiny gear icon at the top right and clicked on email. Okay. I'm right on it. Yep. And then configure at the top left. Yep, got it. And then mail servers below that. Okay, got it. And then in the bottom frame, use the little action drop down to the left of where it says popmrmawa.com, and then you can edit that. Yep. And it'll open up the edit mail server pop-up window. Yep. Just re-enter your password there in the password field for your email address. Okay. My email address and my password. Give me just a second and see if I can find that. Okay. All right. Here. I have something here. Hold on, let me check something else. I'm not, you know, that isn't me doing it either. either Okay. All right. So I'm going to take out this other password that was there and paste in a new one, which I'm not sure that this is right. And if it isn't, I'm going to have to get with my IT guy and get that sorted out and then try it again. But I'm going to click save now. Okay. Okay. And since you click – It says port 110, and I guess that's right? Yeah. Yeah, okay. That should be good. So since you hit save, I'm going to refresh on my end, and I'm going to do a test connection on that and see what comes back. All right, very good. Let's see. All right, I have saved. All right. Okay. And we'll go to mail server test connection. Let's see. Okay, that's still coming back with invalid password, unfortunately. Okay. So, yeah, if you can track down that password, I think that's what's missing here in the connection, so that you can have those activities written on the records, on the name records. Very good. All right, thank you very much. And I'm sorry, your name was? My name's Garrett. Garrett, yes. If you have more questions and get stuck trying to find the place to enter that or anything like that, just let us know. Give us another call. I shall do so. Thank you, Gary. Appreciate your time and your help. Happy to help. Okay. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye....
