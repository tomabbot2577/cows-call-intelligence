## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, this is Paul returning your call. How are you doing, sir? I'm well, Paul. How are you? I'm doing fine. I'm doing fine. We're having trouble. I heard you, but you couldn't hear me when we were talking on the phone. Yeah, you just cut off for a second, but we're doing pretty good now. Hopefully it stays. Okay, good, good, good. So I guess I could just get right down to it. So I'm already using PC Recruiter with Ted Nelson and Associates. And so, you know, we already have, you know, I use the regular version of that. But I saw this new one you came out with, and I was kind of interested in giving it a demo and then using it as a separate entity, you know, for the business that I run myself. The PCRM? Exactly, sir. That's the form. Yeah, that's what I filled out the form for that. Yeah. So that's what I was interested in. And I also saw just today on the login screen that they turned on some of the functionality, the AI functionality for PC Recruiter for free. Do we need to do anything to get that activated? Is it operational right now? It's there right now. Automatically? Yeah, there should be a little AI button on any email send screen or the candidate summary or a job description field. There's a little AI. I think I'll link to a video that shows where it is and how to utilize it. It's real simple. Use once you find it. And that's completely integrated into the one that I'm interested in, right? Yeah. All that functionality is already in there. And that's – yeah, so that would be part of the price. Now, so for just like a one-user kind of thing, you know, is there any pricing? I didn't see anything on the site. Are you guys just demoing it now, or what's the current situation with that? Well, what it is, it's the same price point as the PC Recruiter 9. So it's $115 per user per month for the PCRM and a one-year commitment. You can add or drop users anytime you wish. and then $750 to set it up, which includes 10 hours training, and it includes setup, installation of all of the pieces and the whole software and everything like that. So it's the same pricing, and actually, if you even still wanted a PCR9 link, we could still generate that too because they share the same database. Right, right. Or you could just use PCR9. Yeah, okay, I got you, I got you. So, I mean, is there a demo available for the new one? or how are you going to we generally do that over a zoom so we could get something set up I could do something tomorrow if you have any time tomorrow to take a look at a demo maybe it takes about a half an hour okay what time tomorrow would be a good time for you I could do let me look at my calendar here I could do tomorrow's Friday I could do a 10 a.m 10 30 I could do or 2 or I could do 10 a.m. 10.30 or 2 would be the best or 2.30. 10 sounds great to me. Perfect. 10 Eastern. What I'll do, I've got your email here. I will go ahead and email you an invite and a Zoom so we can dial into that. We can kind of take a look around and show you how to answer questions. It'll be a live database. So we'll be able to take a look at that very easily. Okay, sir. All right. I'll be waiting for your email then. You're going to send that to Paul at XISolution, right? Yep. That's the one I've got. Okay, sir. We'll see you tomorrow then. Awesome. Thank you. I'll talk to you then. Bye-bye now. Okay. Bye now....
