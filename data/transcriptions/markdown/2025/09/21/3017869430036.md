## 💬 Full Transcript

 Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi, is Kathy available? Yes. Hold on just a minute, Robin. Thanks. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hey, how are you? Hey, good. Did you not get my email? I did. I'm just this one. Yeah. Yeah. And I just replied back. I was sitting on hold the whole time. It was music playing and everything. Yeah. You were on hold? I was on hold. Yeah. So then I called back in after I saw your email. I'm like, oh, I guess she doesn't know I'm on hold. Oh, she thought she had put it on hold, and then she thought it hung up. She was like, oops, it's not there. I don't know what happened. I was on hold the entire time. Oh, so sorry. I need you to fix something for me. This is kind of like really bad. So it looks like, only because of the amount. It's not really that bad. Four Seasons Talent Partners. Okay, hold on just a second. So I have to, I can only use one hand because on this phone, it does not connect with my Bluetooth. So I have to hold my cell phone up to my head. So hold on just a second. So I have one hand instead of two to type. So let me get to that customer. And it's Four Seasons, you say? Yeah, that should be enough to pull it up. Four Seasons Talent Partners, right? Right. So this is one that I didn't set up, so I did look it up and confirmed. The invoices on 12-19 and 12-19, those both had one month of user, but then their installation fee split over the first two invoices. So those were fine. And then 2-19 is when they started their regular monthlies. then 319 was regular monthly so i think what happened is when it was created from a sales receipt over to an invoice they used the original amount that was their install and not the 50 dollars that should only be i haven't changed anything yet so it needs to change obviously is we got to do something with these invoices. Anything from 219 on should be $50 only. Yeah. I can adjust the recurring right now if you want, but then we got to refund all that difference back. And I just don't know. I don't want to mess it up. So it's installation payments. Those were just the first. Yeah, that was just the first two invoices. And then after that, it was set up correctly as 50. But I'm guessing they went to kind of like a sales receipt in March. And then with a new billing system, the invoice was created, but with a 425 fee instead of 50. Yep. So I'll create a credit, and then we will refund that back to them. So I fixed the June to make it only 50. Okay. And so we have to refund April and May because they haven't paid June yet. So we've got $375 to pay for two months. We've got $750 to refund. Yeah. Okay. I'll fix that right now. Okay. Should I go to the recurring right now and fix it? Because it's coming out. Okay, I'm just going to take off the install line. Take off that top line, yep. Perfect, okay. Yep. I didn't want to touch it until you saw it, because it looked like it was the sales receipt to new invoice switch that kind of went and got messed up. So let me create the credit memo here. I'm going to put you on speaker so I can cut the phone down. Okay. So I'm going to... I think I'm just going to send this. Okay. So I'm going to... I'm going to send this. I'M GOING TO SEND THIS. WHY DOES IT SAY TOTAL CREDIT 25. Oh, because the original invoice was $50. So, okay. Let me fix the other one as well. Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Let's see. So that would be that one. Okay. The March was... That one. Okay. Yeah, the April needs to be $50. Yep. I'm fixing that one now. Okay. I was reading 325 credits. Should it be 375 for each? Yes, it is. Oh, yeah, I see. Okay. Oh, because they got the one open death right there. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. so so they they're owed $700 because it should have only been $50 and so they're owed wait how come this one says $2 of $3.75 this one is this one is weird why is it $3.75 it says amount received so this says that on 7-16 they got a $50 payment so this actually did she just make that it says 7-16 right now she didn't have that before so I'm going to apply that to the 619 invoice I didn't know she could actually it's got a memo created by QuickBooks Online to link credits to charges Yeah, I don't know if that's correct. Let me, because the bill for 619 was not 50 before. I just changed it to be 50 just now. Well, her open balance is 700. So that would be... That's because it applied 50 of my credit to that change. So I'm fixing that, but I have to double check to see if she actually indeed paid 50, or if QuickBooks Online is just entering something wrong, because they were paying through Biller Genie, So it isn't something that QuickBooks should have necessarily adjusted. So I think it might have been something wrong. So let me look real quick. And of course, Biller Genie is doing something weird with their login. Yeah, it's marking the June one as paid now. I know. I'm just holding just a second. I'm just I have to I got to log into something else to check ...
