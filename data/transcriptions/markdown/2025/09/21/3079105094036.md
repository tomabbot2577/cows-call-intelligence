## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Oh, hi, Robin. You helped us the other day. This is Jennifer Cohen. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I have one more piece to my puzzle that I'm hoping you can help me with. I need to connect LinkedIn Recruiter to PC Recruiter. Okay, so you're probably referring to our PCR Capture extension? Yes. Okay. I think. Yeah, that you get out of the Chrome Web Store. Do you use Chrome? I think I have it already. Yes. Yeah, I think I already have it. Oh, I have the PCR capture. Okay. Did you connect it to your database? I don't know if it's connected to the database. Okay. Can we do a screen share? Yeah. Okay. Again, I have my husband back with me again. Okay, let's see. I am going to... Bear with me one second. I'm going to send you an invite for the link, with the link to join. Okay. You should have something in your email in just a moment. And then when you join the meeting, don't join with audio or camera since we're already on the phone and we don't need to use camera. Yeah. okay so you're in the meeting and then what I'm going to have you do is click the share screen option at the bottom of the meeting it's almost like directly bottom center the rectangle is an arrow and then that's going to pop up a window go over at the right where it says entire screen and then select which screen to show okay yeah I see the extension oh why is your screen blurry that's kind of weird okay I'm saying She's not telling her anything. Yeah, we're currently sharing. Okay. So one thing we probably should do, see how it says relaunch to update? That might kick you out of the meeting, but it's always best to make sure your Chrome is updated. It looks like you're only, like, half updated. See at the top right where it says relaunch to update? Yeah, I can do it. Yeah. I'll go ahead and click it. Oh, that's probably what it's grayed out. Okay. Now, that might kick you out of the meeting. I don't know if it'll bring it right back in. Okay. I can still see you, so that's good. Okay, so see the capture extension at the very top right? It's the purple, green, and blue icon. Let's click directly on that. okay so one second so this right here yeah and it looks like it could be connected to your database now do you know when you grab somebody off LinkedIn do you want to get like their company as well yeah probably everything that I can capture yeah okay just to make sure see where it says captured a default company slide that on and then back off just to make sure Okay, and then back on. Now it's on. Now it's on. Now turn it off. Yeah. Just want to make sure. And always leave basic mode off. Basic is kind of like a grab and go where you don't really interact with it at all. Not recommended. Okay, so now if you go over to LinkedIn. Give me one second. Hang on. Let me get my LinkedIn. Yeah, we want to make sure you're on Chrome. I am going to hang on. I'm going to switch. Oh, here we go. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So you have to open up somebody's profile. So you have to go to a person. So I have to go back to PCR. No, no. You go to LinkedIn. Oh, just anybody in LinkedIn. Yeah. Basically what the extension does is when you're on somebody's page, it creates the page to create a name record for them. Okay. So it's just anyone. I'm just going to find myself. I probably would not put yourself in the database, because then if you put your email address on a record, then any email that you write would kind of probably write to that one. Okay. I don't know who to find then. I'll put my husband. Okay. Okay. Okay. So if I do it like this and then I click the... No, you don't have to do anything. See how just automatically as soon as you go to somebody's page, it recognizes that you're on a LinkedIn profile. Over at the right, it's about halfway down. That's the extension popping up. Ah, got it. Okay, so it's in a better location. So I'm going to add them. Now here what happens, notice how it says review new name and review new company. What this means is we don't think Scott Cohen's in your database and we don't see Meadowbrook leasing. So if you were to go through and maybe make any kind of adjustments to it and then hit submit, it'd be creating a new name, but also a new company. Now, other people that you may go to, you might be alerted for a duplicate. You would select that card. And then like on a company, usually if it comes up where the company's already in the database, it's better to hover on the card and hit the checkbox. so that way you're selecting the company, but you're not making a change to it. Excellent. Okay. Okay. But that's it. Yeah. So once you go to somebody's profile, it pops up, but it's over at the right. You don't really have to click on the upper section or upper icon unless you're needing to sign out of it or change some of those settings, which you don't need to do. Excellent. All righty. Anything else? I think that's it. All righty. have a great week you too thanks ...
