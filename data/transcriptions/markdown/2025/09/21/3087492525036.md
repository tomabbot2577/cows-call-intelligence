## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Central Executive Search. To reach Gary G. Lombardo, please dial 101. To reach Angelo G. Lombardo, please dial 105. To reach Leanne Devine, please dial 106. Please hold while I try to connect you. This is Leanne with Central Executive Search. How can I help you? Hi, Leanne. It's Jim Lombardo with PCV. Hi, Jim. How are you? I'm well. I'm well. Wanted to give you a call. I had a couple emails from you. Wanted to get everything handled. Gotcha. Yeah, so first, so we need to change company name and signer. Is that my understanding there? Yeah, but we're kind of leaving everything the same right now. Gary's semi-retired, and then Angelo has taken over. But I think the only thing that we really needed to change was, like, his name being on the invoice, which I don't know if you did that already. And then we also wanted to add another person. Perfect. Okay. So what I will do, I will ensure with Robin, who works on our training team, that she has changed to get Angela's name on the invoice. I'll also put in a ticket to add another user that would take you from four to five total, correct? Yes. Okay. And they're $115 per user per month. So you'll just notice that change on the next invoice wherever it comes. And who are they emailed to you to the invoices? I believe it would be Angelo. Okay. I didn't know who they were sent to now. Oh, I think they might be getting sent to Gary right now. Okay. Yeah. Let me just ensure I have his email address. I'm sure he's in my system. Angelo at centraljobs.com. Yep. Yeah. Perfect. Well, I will go ahead and get everything, all those changes made. you'll notice a ticket coming to add to you the user and then I'll ensure with Robin that everything is changed over to Angelo and then if you need to change the the company name or once Gary officially fully retires give me a quick ping and I can email over new paperwork to get Angelo as the signer change the agreement or change the company name and everything like that okay okay sounds good um and then with the user thing I you had seen that I had brought up a couple of questions regarding limitations to the new user oh yeah yeah so yeah is it gonna be possible to do something like that because we like we don't want her to have access to like attachments or like change anything or access confidential info but we want her to be able to search access name records and see activities but obviously do nothing with those perfect so what you want to do when you go into that username that you may or may not have created for her. I know you go to the permissions, right? Yes. So if you go to permissions, under security, there's going to be a whole host of permissions for anything you could imagine. So what you want to do for one, like companies, attachments, you'd want to give no permission. Names, attachments, give no permission. And then the activities, you could give her like add safe, but not delete. The notes, you can do add only. So various things like that, they're kind of in sections the first is the company section then positions then names so those are going to be kind of the big ones those are going to be records and you would want to do add save to most of those and look or like attachments give no permission to that and then there's other reporting ones and get various different things you want to make sure she can't export data so there's one for like export records you want to give no permission on that but kind of peruse those and if you have any questions on any specifics give me give me a quick email or anything give me a quick call or you can dial into our tech support forth they can't answer any questions on that all right cool that works kind of block her down that way awesome all right all right I think that's it excellent well anything else you need let me know all right sounds good thank you so much Jim I hope you have a lovely rest of your day you saw take care thank you bye-bye...
