## 💬 Full Transcript

 You're going main sequence technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler, Alyssa at HC Pursuit. How are you doing? Not too bad. And yourself? I'm all right. I'm just a little annoyed that I can't figure out how to edit and add global attachments. I went to the search bar. I went to the place where you would add attachments. And it annoys me that I can't figure out how to do that. Let me. Without calling you. Give me two seconds because I need a little refresher myself because we don't really add global attachments all that often. Just want to make sure I'm adding it in the right spot here. Well, and one of my colleagues is constantly adding, like, you know, stuff to a global attachment that doesn't need to be there. So I'm, you know, always wanting to get that out of there. Okay. So the way you can add a global attachment is you can go to any name record. Okay. Go to Attachments. Go to Global. And then you would just do the add from that global tab. So I want to delete the ones that don't want to be there because that's stupid to have somebody's references as a global attachment. Okay. And somebody's portfolio. delete. Alright, good. And then I want to add add files. Beautiful. Thank you so much. I feel like an idiot having to call you. Because I know it's always something simple like that, like just do it in a record, but yeah, whatever. You would think there would be a database setting. I get confused with that one all the time too. Or if you look for it, you know, if you're in, you know, the main settings window thing and you start typing global attachment, it should direct you, but it doesn't. I agree. Of course you do, because it makes perfect sense. Yeah. All right. Well, thank you so much. I will let you get back to more important things with more important people. I'm more than happy to help. If you need anything else, just let us know. I know. You're the best. Thank you so much. Have a good one. You too. Bye....
