## 💬 Full Transcript

 I mean, I don't have to help you. Okay, let me get my volume up a little bit so I can hear you better. Hi there. I'm Connie Rose. Can you hear me good? Yep. Can you hear me? Yep. I think what's happening is all the scammers got together and handed my number out. Because every time I get on the phone, a scam call comes in, and then I can't hear who I'm talking to. Anyhow, what I'm trying to do today, I'm with Connective Services. You need to log in or whatever. You can probably see that I'm out on the software. I'm trying to load the phone app. And so I downloaded the app from the store. And I'm using a droid, by the way, but it's a fairly new one, new droid. And it says enter login, URL or code. So I have a login for my laptop, but it doesn't like name and password. It's really weird. In the middle of the page, it says, if you are a contractor, please see your activation email and access the app. There is no activation email. Nope. So in that box, you'll put in that whole long URL, that https colon forward slash forward slash www2.pcrecruiter.net, that whole big long code that you see on your login page for PC Recruiter. Okay. I'm logged in so should I just log out? Here let me, I got you pulled up here. I'm going to email it to you. Okay then I can just snatch it. How in the world am I going to, okay I got you. It'll come on my phone. Yep and then once you put in that URL that's when it'll ask you for your username and password. Okay here we go. I would have never figured this out Tyler. and copy your own paste say so it's got database and then when I click on that I've got connected services I imagine connected services username okay I think I got it from here but I never figured that out I'm glad I called you not a Not a problem. Thank you so much. You have a wonderful day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye....
