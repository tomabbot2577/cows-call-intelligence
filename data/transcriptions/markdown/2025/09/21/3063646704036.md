## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Chris Ortiz. I received your email this morning. You were trying to help me set up my PCR integration with RingCentral. I figured at this point, after all these emails, it would be easier just to call you and maybe have you log into my system. I don't have the RingCentral connect status button that you're asking me about it just doesn't exist on my screen so I don't know what's going on and I had Augustin who works with Victor help me out and he couldn't figure it out either that's why they told me to open the ticket with you guys okay we'll take a look let me just log into your database here perfect just let me know if you need any info from me No, that's all right. Okay, phone number. Central is turned on. Good. Which username are you logged in under? I'm under. Let me log back out and log in. Okay. I don't know if I can see it from my – I'm still trying to understand how to work this. So what do I click on to see that information? Is it the little gear in the corner? If you hover over the little profile picture at the top right, it will show you the username that you're logged in under. Okay. It says admin slash Chris. Okay. Okay. So you have RingCentral set up for the C or T's username, but it hasn't been set up yet for the admin username. Are you going to be continuing to log in as admin or are you going to be logging in under the C or T's username that you created? You tell me, Matt. I have no idea. I worked with someone else and they set up everything for me. I don't know the difference. So you tell me what's better and I'll do that. Okay. Yeah. I would recommend logging in under the C or T's username rather than admin. And then that's already ready to go to connect RingCentral with that RingCentral status. Otherwise, you'd have to make some additional changes to the admin username to have that button appear. Why did they have me set up an admin then? So all PCR databases, when they're created, have a user called admin and a user called template. These are just kind of catch all or like a fail safe so that if you ever forget your password or get locked out from too many password attempts on your everyday use username, you can log in under admin and adjust your password or unlock your account. account. So you can just maybe make note of your admin username and password. So you can always get in under that. And then also make note of your, of course, your everyday use username like CRTs. But you can log in either way in case you get locked out of one of them. Okay. So I'm going to be using CRTs for all my stuff. Yeah, that's usually how it is. Now on, I should just use C or T's. Okay. Yeah, that's recommended. And then admin is just like a backup username. All right. So I've saved off the button now for the connect, and I disconnected and connected again. Okay. Now how do I check to see if it's working? So you can open a user. You can open a name record. So if you go to name in the main menu up at the top, and then do you have any recent name records listed there to the right of basic search? I do. I have sample position, and I just don't know if these are real people or – because I think they upload that stuff in the database. The one phone number they have here is definitely a fake number. It's 555-123-456. Okay. So, yeah, if you do have any phone number fields on a record, you could just click on the phone icon to the right, and that should open up RingCentral and start dialing the number. So if you do have one, you could enter a real number in there and then test it. Yeah, I could actually call. Let me see. I can just call myself, right? Yeah, maybe put your own phone number in a field temporarily so you can click that phone icon. And are you using RingCentral to call me currently, or is that because that might block you from getting a call? No, I'm using my cell phone. Okay. Gotcha. So I'm just probably dialing myself, and I'm getting my phone number, 325-05. Awesome. So that should be set up then. That's good. But it looks like it's... Okay....
