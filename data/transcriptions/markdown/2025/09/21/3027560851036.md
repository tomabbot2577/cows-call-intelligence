There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon, this is Jim. Hello, this is Jim. hey how are you i am doing all right uh still recovering a bit from this covid spell but happy to be with you and thank you again for being so flexible uh and accommodating i know you've got i think a vacation coming up next week so um i appreciate you making the time no problem no problem where are you headed i'm going to the outer banks in north carolina that's where we'll be oh my gosh how fun i've never been well no i don't think that's north carolina in general but i've heard of the outer banks so that's cool it's cool i was there 10 years ago. So it's been a little while. Oh my gosh. Well, that will be fun. For sure. Did you get the COVID where it's the really, really sore throat, the one they were talking about? It's so interesting because I wasn't originally going to test because I didn't have the sore throat. And I heard from so many people that that's kind of what they've experienced with this new strain. And instead, what I had, and now, you know hindsight so it's 2020 right and you probably don't need my full medical history but I did go to the dentist the day before that I left because I had this like crazy out of nowhere like back of my jaw toothache and you know kind of went away and then when I was on vacation one morning I woke up and my like whole right side like my ear was just fully um it just felt like it was totally blocked or plugged like and that whole side of my face just felt really not normal. And so, but for me, it kind of went upward. So now I'm kind of dealing with like the fogginess and the just extreme, like, you know, it just, you don't feel like yourself. Right. So, I mean, I think I sound relatively okay, but you know, I definitely feel like something's kind of off still, but yeah, I guess it, you know, it has been picking up, which I, shame on me, I guess we're not paying attention to, you know, that being kind of on a surge, But, yeah, so. Yeah, I remember the pressure. I had COVID years ago, like in 2022 or something. I remember heading to Washington, D.C. for the holidays and going through the mountains of Pennsylvania. My head was so stuffed like that. And I've driven that way 100 times off to the East Coast. But that day, it was just, it hurt so bad I could barely even stand. My eyes were tearing because the pressure and the elevation changes were just hurting so bad. It was terrible. I bet. It was the worst. Yeah, no, that is horrible. I was nervous about getting on the plane because I thought, okay, this could go one of two ways. And thankfully, I was able to kind of sleep on the flight. I think I was just so exhausted from everything else. I got lucky with that. But, yeah, it's lingered longer than I would like it to. So I'm ready just to feel better. For sure. For sure. Well, glad you're on the mend. Glad you're on the mend. So I want to show you around PCRM a little bit. What have you heard about it? I'm excited. Have you seen it? Have you heard anything? Okay. You know, I want to say I might have seen one screenshot from, oh, my gosh, Dave Reith, I believe is his name. I don't know if you are familiar with Dave Reith. He has his or his, you know, business is a part of the Dimensional Search family. He might even be SRA now. But I think I saw one screenshot from him, but I really haven't. Other than that, I don't know much. So I'm a sponge excited to learn. Okay, excellent, excellent. So, yeah, so the CCRM, I'm not sure if you know, it was designed, it was started a couple of years ago. It was going to be a whole replacement interface for 9. But what happened is as they were adding more functionality, more CRM functionality, early this year it was decided that we were going to spin it off into a separate product almost, but one that shares the same database as PC Recruiter. So the nice part about that is that you can utilize both versions at once. And if you add a PCRM, you don't have to convert your data or move your data or anything like that. You can still log in under PCR9 or under PCRM. So you kind of would have both interfaces if you wish. The PCRM interface is going to have almost everything that you currently have in PCR9, but it's going to add a simpler sequencing piece, a sales funnel, and this whole new interface. So it's going to add a whole new way to look at PC Recruiter. So we're looking at the sign-in screen here. I'll show you around kind of the basics of what it looks like and some of the stuff that's in here that's not in 9. So as I go in, I'm going to go ahead and log myself in. And once I get in, you'll see this is my dashboard that pops up. But how we've set it up, everything's kind of down the left-hand side of the screen. So rather than putting the menu bar at the top and ma...
