## 💬 Full Transcript

 You have reached the desk of Marissa Horton with CSG. Please leave a message at the tone and I will return your call as soon as possible. I look forward to speaking with you. Hi Marisa, this is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I was giving you a call about the user who's getting an error I've never seen before saying you can't make more than nine calls at a time. I guess one thing would be she really authenticated as herself but also maybe something's hung up in the back end. I haven't come across this message before and I'm wondering maybe just something's kind of like hung up with a RingCentral app, that maybe if she restarts her computer, let's see if that clears it up. Give me a call back 440-946-5214. I'm at extension 5466. Thanks....
