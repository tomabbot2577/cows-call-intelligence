I don't know where Mayfield went. No, I went to Brush. So maybe it was Hyrum. Oh, you were. Yeah, yeah. I know we went to Hyrum. So yeah, I forgot we went to Brush. But I was 94. You were a couple years before. Like only one. But probably about the same. I was 68. So I went 60 years, 60 years older. So we went to Hyrum House. And you probably did too. It was kind of close by. But yeah, the cabins were in a circle. It was much smaller. Yeah, I don't remember being a pig. Okay, yeah. So then maybe it was Hyrum. Okay. I don't remember. It was many, many years ago. A long time ago. I don't remember what I did yesterday, let alone when I was 12 years old. Although I can tell you every word to some songs. I don't understand how you do that. I want to just check in and see about, because I'm going through my email, and I have like 100, so I'm working on getting caught back up. And this whole Christina Stone, is there anything that still needs done with her? She was the one. She needed a data return, a reduction in users, and a cancellation. hold on one second because I'm not fusion recruiters yeah okay fusion recruiters okay I can't keep everybody straight right now sorry fusion recruiters user updates okay so let's see did a user update three months ago um are these oh I'm hold on one second I have a filter assigned to me hold on one second there's a data request okay I got to see if they paid it though get a request also process the invoice okay so their data return is assigned over McKenzie he hasn't done it yet okay so I'm going to tag him can you please follow up on it it looks like their user adjustment you put that in and they are now down to two so that is done yeah hold on I just don't think anything is assigned to me I think I whatever I did I think I've assigned my stuff over so the data reach return is assigned over to McKenzie removing users three days ago seven to two users and then two months ago no longer terminating the agreement and then that one was closed out. Hold on one second. Determinate, okay. Rather than terminating our entire agreement, we requested to terminate, what? Termination question. Give me a negative. We'd like to continue access to maintain. So the last thing, so in 101.473, they just wanted to go down and have just the two users and just be able to access it. Okay. Are they still canceling or do you know? I haven't, I don't think, wait, let me look at, hold on. Oh, migrating to new tracking system, but I don't know if they're actually canceling. I think they're wanting to still maintain. Oh, not canceling now. Here's a note from three days ago. not canceling now contract up next May did drop to two users so we'll be accessing the database until end of the agreement okay okay so they're going to go to two users for the end till the end of the agreement which is next May yes groovy I think I'm going to give her a courtesy call just to kind of close a loop let her know her returns in process she's already to to confirm she's staying and then I'll kind of throw that just in an activity so we're sure because I there were so many emails from her and she happened to be the oldest one I had so I'm starting at the bottom and working up yeah I mean there was a lot of back and forth and there's multiple tickets I was like wait a minute let me see because I knew I knew the name Christina Stone um yeah the data return that's all paid everything it's just sitting with Mackenzie he's just going on yeah and he was at the dentist yesterday so he was out for a while and yeah i've been throwing a lot of tickets at him and he's he's busy yeah poor guy um i think he was ...
