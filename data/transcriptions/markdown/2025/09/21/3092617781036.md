## 💬 Full Transcript

 I'll give you Tyler to help you. Hello, Tyler. My name is Gene Cantrell. We're with Sandia's Executive Search. We're a customer of yours and I need some help here. So, what's going on? So, I'm trying to integrate PCR with ZoomInfo, okay? And when I'm doing it, it's asking me for a database ID. And when I'm putting in my database ID, which shows me to find it under settings and then API settings, it brings up construction.cnd as executive search, and that's it for the database ID. Correct. Okay. And so that is my database ID. Yes, that is your database ID. Okay, so it's not taking it on their end for that. Do you know, I mean, I don't know if this is a common thing. Is there a different, do I need to create an API token for this or do you know? No, you should be able to just do your regular PCR username, PCR password, and then your database ID. Okay. Yeah, it's giving me fits doing that. Now, sometimes with ZoomInfo, you do have to have a specific package to be able to access their integrations. Yeah, I have that package. oh yeah we upgraded to that package to do this so gotcha so um yeah those are the correct settings okay all right yeah fair enough i just i just wanted to be sure that i wasn't missing something so um on on the pcr side first so okay not a problem all right thanks sir all right yep Have a good one. Bye....
