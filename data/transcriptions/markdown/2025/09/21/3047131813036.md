## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Tiffany Wallace from Dagan Personnel. Hi. How are you? I'm good, thank you. Hey, listen, I'm wondering if I could have somebody remote into my system, and if I need to call back and designate, like, you know, 15 to 30 minutes with somebody, if you don't have that kind of time today, I'll be happy to do it. But I've got to get an accurate temp report. And so I need to run a report that shows everybody I have on assignment currently so I can get that cleaned up. And then I need to figure out a way to have, like, some kind of temp report I can run each week that shows active contractors that are on assignment. Okay. One thing that you can do, if you want to see a list to clean up that way you're actually going into the record, have you tried going to um in your from your main toolbar hit contract okay and then go to hours hours hours okay yeah i like this view the best personally okay and then um you'll pick the week that you're looking at or need to look at well like i think i've never even cleaned up a report and so I'm wondering can I get one that shows just anybody for the last two years that maybe I need to take off the report yeah so if you but if you go to contract and you go to hours once you pick that date and then hit the search option at the top right okay that'll show you anybody that's right now on assignment oh okay so I could do whether or not they have a time sheet and then what this will allow you to do because you'll see you'll see the assignment begin and end date so if you know somebody's off assignment you'll be writing the record rather than running a report but if you click right on that date you could fill in the end date and then save it so you might have a lot of people or it has like like wherever if it says 2099 what that really means is no end date has been selected. Okay, so it says 78 timesheets for the people that are on there. Yeah, so I mean, it doesn't really matter. You'll see over at the right where it says status, they probably don't have a timesheet unless you're using it. So people didn't know. Yeah, so this is just a nice way that you'll see who's considered on assignment based on the dates. So if you like use this, if you click directly where it says assignment begin end date, it pops up that placement record for you that you can go in and update the end date. So especially if it says like 2099 or no end date, you could put in when they – Does that make sense? Yes. Okay. So then this shows me currently everybody that I have on an assignment, and that 2099 just means there's no end date. Yeah. When you click directly on that date, it actually pops up the placement record. And then you can go to the end date field, pick, and then, like, type in when they ended, and then just re-save it, that placement record. Okay. Great. And then that way, if I don't have, if I have, like, I have a payroll report that shows somebody that is working, but they're not on this list, then I should enter them in there and put them on an assignment, basically. Yeah. Okay. So this is the most accurate way. Go ahead. I like, yeah, I like doing it this. I mean, you could even just go to assigned and then put in the date, but you got to remember then like clear out the username and stuff like that. Let me see. Does this even mean what I'm looking for? I just like doing it from the hours just because I'm so used to going there. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Sure. But you could even, like, when you go to contract, if you go to assigned, you would just have to clear out the username. That will also give you the same option of seeing the date. So really, it's just an easier way to get to all of those contract placement records and see the end date and everything. Great. That is awesome. I mean, so what I want to do then is like each week I want to be able to run a report or during the day or whatever and see who we have on assignment currently. And this is a great way to do it by hours. But then can I then print this out? Can I save this and print it out or send it to my team? How would I do that? That one I don't believe because it's really more meant to. Actually, you know what? Let me throw in. I have one that's really good. Hold on one second. Yeah, and if not, is there a way that you and I can... You might even have it. Okay. There's, like, there is a report. I just kind of like the one I do better. Yeah. Well, I mean, if you could help me create even a report that I can save, you know, that I can go to. Yeah, let me see if you even have it already. Okay. Sometimes we threw it in the template databases. Oh, okay. Yeah, you do. Okay, your database has it. If you go to... It's just in a different place. I just like these better. If you go to reports up on the main toolbar. Okay, I'm going to write this down. So I'm going to go to reports, main toolbar. Okay, and then in the upper left section scroll down to custom SQL reports. Custom SQL reports. Okay, so the reason I'm taking ...
