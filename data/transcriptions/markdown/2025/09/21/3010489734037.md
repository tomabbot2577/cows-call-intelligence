 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Ellie, could you turn that down just a little bit, baby? please thank you Good morning, Jenny. do you hear me? I can, yes. Awesome. How are you? I'm well. How are you doing? I'm good. I saw myself in the video and I was scared so I had to I knew we were doing video but I had to get some lipstick just in case. I always keep mine off just because I'm usually looking at the keyboard or taking notes or something of that nature. I prefer it but you know I just try to be friendly about it, right? Oh, for sure. I don't like videos you say but yeah, so no, good, good. Well, good to talk with you. How's your day so far? Okay, okay. And sorry I hadn't gotten. I later dug down and saw that you had replied. I sent it to you late. But it was no worries. We can get in now. So, yeah. So I wanted to talk a little bit and show you a little bit around the PCRM product. See, have you seen it? What have you heard? I only heard that it's existed. And it's a simplified version of PCR, and that's all I know. Sure, sure. So, yeah, so what it originally was going to be, it was designed, it was started several years back, and it was originally going to be a new user interface for PCRecruiter. And they were just kind of freshening things up, making it look a little bit more modern. But then once we started looking at various client suggestions and requests and feature requests and stuff like that, they ended up adding in quite a bit of CRM functionality that the decision was made at the beginning of this year to spin it off as a separate product, but that shares the same database. So it essentially gives you the luxury of being able to log on to the exact same database through PCRM or through PCR9, which is the version of PC Recruiter you have right now. so you could even have people using both and we do some people are letting their sales people and their marketing people use the pcrm and then their recruiters are still using pcr9 because that's what they're used to um up until very recently that's fantastic by the way that's a nice thing and people have if we've really gotten some good feedback because people really like the flexibility of you get both versions you pick which one you want to use some people like the look and feel of PCRM so they're kind of heading that way off of the PCR 9 but we have no plans to end PCR 9 so there's really both versions you can go with up until this week the searching in PCRM wasn't quite up to par but that has been improved and addressed so so that's going to work pretty well as well so let me show you on PCRM just kind of show you that the difference in the look some of the new features it includes and some stuff like that. So do you see my screen? Do you see my screen? Okay. I do. Yes. Perfect. Perfect. So I am now going to get logged into my PCRM. And again, all it is is a different URL to the same database. So all I do is put my same username and password in as I do for my PCR9 database. And I'm able to log into this one. So I can log in. And the biggest difference you'll notice is going to be most things are kind of widget-based. And then over here, the main menu bar is down the left-hand side of the screen as opposed to across the top. And that helps us to make better use of the entire screen. If I select names, you'll see my name search, and most recently viewed is the entire screen. If I click one, it's going to slide in from the right. So it's more of a side-to-side thing than it is a up-and-down thing. You have that feel of what people get on their phone perhaps, right? Yeah, yeah. And screens are getting wider, not taller, monitors. So that's why we kind of decided to go that way. I use just a laptop and keep it pretty zoomed in, but you can really zoom it out and show quite a bit of information on the screen if you're using a second screen or a monitor or something like that. Okay. So you're going to have a lot of the same things, named companies' positions, roll-ups, schedules, activities, reports. all of those are the same terminology. Some of them look very similar, like the schedule, they didn't change that screen much. They softened it up and made it match this version a little bit. They didn't change that much, but they did, for example, the roll-up lists. Those look quite different. So you can kind of see you have an edit in line here, so you can make changes to the description or name right from there. You can do add names right from the main screen, or if you click into one of those roll-up lists, it too is going to slide in from the right. and then you're okay nice that's me okay then I can pop into a record there and then I can go back into the list and I can kind of let's see I can pop the search function so tell me about that perfect perfect so the search a couple of different ways you can do it...
