## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah, Taylor, how's your day going? Good, how are you? Good. My name is Michael Perry, and I'm with Paragon Recruiters. And way back when, I had submitted a form online asking about PCRM. And I've also submitted another form asking about AI Suite. And then now you have the new one, the PC Capture. Of course, I never heard anything back because anytime you submit those things, you never hear anything back from you guys. So I'm calling again to find out about the PCRM. What is that? Go ahead. The PCRM is just a new interface for the software. Okay. A little bit more modern. A little bit different functionality. It's just like a new version of the software. Okay. and does that cost additional money to get that yes oh okay so there's the rut so is that a one-time thing or is that a monthly fee or what what is that so i'm not 100 sure on the cost i do know there is a setup fee associated with it and the cost like per user per month is more than like the like it you'd have to be like on the premium subscription package okay okay so again when i sent my uh you know where you can submit something where is it on your help or whatever um that was one of my questions and of course no one got back to me how do i actually get find out what the costs may be. So what I can do is transfer you to your account representative, Jim Lombardo. He would be able to answer any of those account questions, especially with like pricing and all that. He'd be the one that you'd want to talk to about the AI suite as well. Okay. And what is that just from a 40,000 foot view. I mean obviously I know what AI is but... Yeah so there's some features in there we have that help with content generation so things like job summaries, emails, form letters, then some search capabilities with it as well being able to search the database using AI. Okay. Oh, okay. So let me ask you, on the PCRM, we've been using your products since, oh my gosh, probably going on 12 years now, so 12, 13 years, 14 years, something like that. And I've submitted, I've talked to people about a number of limitations with your current platform. One of them, of course, there's actually a lot of them, and none of them have ever been addressed. You guys are really good about third-party integrations, but not fixing your core stuff, in my opinion. So here's just my question. The PCRM, is it, you've used it, I guess you probably trained in it. Is it even worth doing anything? Does it really bring that much more to the party? Or is it just kind of, it looks nice and fluffy and pretty? It's definitely a lot more user-friendly. It's a lot easier to navigate. There's a lot of widgets and dashboards that can make navigation easy in the database. Okay. What about basic tools? Like, for instance, your editor is awful. I've been complaining about that since we signed up with you guys. Is it a different editor? So, for instance, if you want to go in and, you know, right now we just type it up in Word and we import it in. And that works for the most part. But it is really limited, like the fonts available, other things. Does PCRM address any of those issues? It's the same text editor as before. Okay. What about one of the things in a roll-up? This has been a complaint of mine. So, you know, let's say you have in Excel and you want to, let's say you have 100 items on a particular list in Excel. And you want to do the first 25 and skip five and then do, you know, let's just say another 25 and skip five or, you know, whatever. Or, you know, right now you can hold down the shift key and highlight those first 25, skip, and then you could hold down, you know, the shift key again and do another 25. So right now, you know, you've got to find your names. So you're only picking the things, and then you can hit control, and you can do individual lines in Excel. Are you familiar with that function? You know, like to hide? Okay. So with your Rolex, you can't do that. You can either select the whole page, and the problem is if you go and you try to unselect, or let's just say there's 100 on the page, and you go in and select the whole page, but you want to skip certain ones, you know, like, okay, go down five. You know, forget that person or, you know, whatever. if you do that then basically you got to start over just kick you out and basically and then if you go to the next window then you lose everything that you've done if you try to do it that way so you don't really have that shift function control function to be able to highlight by rows skip a few, you know, highlight a few more without having to check each individual box. And, you know, if you're getting to the point where you're, let's say, doing something with 500, 600 names, that gets to be awful tedious because when you switch pages, you lose what you did on the other pages. So has PCRM addressed that issue? So roll-up lists are completely reworked in PCRM. Th...
