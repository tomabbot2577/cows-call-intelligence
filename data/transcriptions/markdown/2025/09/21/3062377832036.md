## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling your agency. I hope you can see Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, this is Sean Reeves calling from Corrigo Consulting. Question for you. I'm getting ready to upload a CSV into PC Recruiter, and one of the fields under the domain field, it just has the, it's stripped of the HTTPS colon slash slash. It just has the, like the name.com or name of the company, .net, will that import correctly and add all the HTTPS slash slash www bit when it goes into PC? No, it has to be in the correct format. It has to be. Even if you just do the www dot in front of everything? Yeah. But it imports as it is in the spreadsheet. Okay, so if I need to put the www dot in front of it, but once that's done, it will add the other stuff in front of that? Yeah, so it doesn't add it on the record itself. It'll display the www. Then when you click the browser button, it'll jump to the website. It will go to the website correctly. Yes. Okay. Okay, cool. All right. I just wanted to double-check and make sure before I upload 300 or 400 of these. Sounds good. I'll add some www in front of it then. Yep. All right. what's that? then you'll be good to go alright, sounds good, thank you very much have a great day...
