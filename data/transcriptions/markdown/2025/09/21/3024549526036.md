## 💬 Full Transcript

 Scott Grillo. Hey, Scott. This is Jason calling from Main Sequence Technologies. I got your voicemail about having issues with the PCR capture tool. Yeah, thanks. I was trying to do this myself. I just can't seem to do it. I'm a knucklehead. If you can walk me through getting that thing. Yeah. I know the basics, but I just can't seem to get it going. Yeah, we got you. So go ahead and open your browser. Okay. and then in a new tab search PCR capture tool okay and you're going to be looking for a Chrome store link it's usually like the second or third option PC Recruiter or PC Capture yeah and is it does the link look like it's from the Chrome store hold on a second oh Chrome here to get a download yep Yep, got it. Chrome Web Store. Got it. Okay. Awesome. And is there a button in the corner once you open that that says add extension? I don't see that. It's like blue and in the top right-ish quadrant. It might say remove extension if you already have it. It says remove from Chrome. Okay. It sounds like you already have it installed. So up in the top right corner, click on the puzzle piece icon. It's like in the window of your browser. And hit the push pin for the PCR capture tool. Okay. Has it crossed through it now? Perfect. So what we need is your PCR login URL. So open a new tab and go to the login screen for PCRecruiter. Copy that and paste it back somewhere. Yeah. You're going to click on the PCR extension that appeared to the left of the puzzle piece. You'll click on that and then paste the URL in that field. Okay. Click on the puzzle piece, PCR capture. Mm-hmm. And then I see all the LinkedIn Recruit Light, you know, sales, all that stuff. Okay. It sounds like it's already connected. Can you go to a LinkedIn profile and just see if it pops up? Yeah, I was trying that. I think it's still not popping up. Okay. Let's get on a screen share. That might be the best way to go about things. Do you have RingCentral? I think so. Wait, no, I don't think so. Hold on. No, I don't think I do. Okay. In your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. Meeting ID? It's 793-070-7907. Okay. Let's wait for you to join that meeting. Perfect. I can see you in here. You're going to continue without audio. And then in the bottom, there's going to be that share button. Click on that, but make sure you select entire screen. Sure, sure, sure, sure. I know I'm seeing this alert. Sure. Entire screen. Got it. Okay. It's not saying share. You have to click. There's a preview window of your screens. You have to click on one, and then the share button should light up. Okay. Okay. Try resharing. You shared something really specific. Okay. There should be a section at the top of the share window that says, like, entire screen. It'll say, like, screen one, screen two. Yeah, it does. there it is okay got it screen one screen two all right and I'll move this okay and perfect okay so go to go to LinkedIn I just want to see what happens when we try to open a profile. Find somebody here. my freaking system is running really slow it's funny i'm getting great download speeds but it's it's been really bad today i don't know what that is but that's what started this whole mess trying to fix that you see that i'm not getting the the do-well yeah um can you click on the public profile i want to see if it works on the public site because these are technically two different sites yeah i tried that and that i don't think it did but let's check okay remember i remember that problem because the pcr capture tool is also like the very last thing to load on a page so it might also be timing out if the speeds on your machine are just kind of really slow it wasn't it wasn't happening before I went in and changed a bunch of shit and I know I deleted it so it's not the fault of it's not the speed but even the other day the speed my LinkedIn is just not loading very fast it's really I've never been this bad yeah okay see this is exactly what happens it just yeah i don't know i don't know what's going on with the network it's like i'm getting a megabyte you know download speeds or whatever it is but um so the capture tool is reading the page it's just not prompting so do you see like uh just as an example do you see travis hosh in your um more profiles for you it has the tcr logo to the right of his name so it's definitely connected. Just not prompting for some reason. Can you click on the PCR logo next to the puzzle piece in the browser window? Yeah, go ahead and open the PCR capture tool. Oh, okay. Can you try turning on all the LinkedIn ones. And that's all we should really... There we go. It popped up now. That's funny because it was on Recruiter. Why wouldn't it have come up? Yeah, I don't know. Can we go back to Recruiter and see if it's working? Sure. Okay. There we go. Is this Recruiter Lite or is it like the... No, it's Heavy Duty. Okay. I wonder if there was some type of change in those URLs that it's reading differently now. Can you try turning off...
