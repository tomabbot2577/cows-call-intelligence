## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, can you hear me? Oh, I got you now, yep. I know the feeling. Who am I speaking with? This is Dave Stady with Virtus Recruiting. Okay. What can I help you with? I am having trouble with my Outlook integration. The password that I'm using when I launch Outlook is telling me there's no endpoint listening. Yeah, it's not actually your password. It's just that you need to update you much you have a much older version of the portal. I could definitely walk you through simple six. If you can just fully exit Outlook for a moment. Okay. Okay and then go over to a web browser like Chrome and search for PC recruiter downloads let me know once you get to our downloads page it'll be at the left just pull down it'll say peace recruiter from Microsoft Outlook yep there's a green link download PCR for Outlook go ahead and click that When we set this up, we'll just go back and repopulate my calendar? Yeah, actually it will. What will happen is anything that, and it's probably been going on for a while, where it wasn't connected. So when you first go back to Outlook, the activity queue will basically find anything that wasn't able to write. Got it. At first it might be a little slow with us trying to find and then write activities and things like that. But that will eventually catch up. Got it. All right. I'm going to accept the license. Next. Install. Okay, we're finished. Okay. So when you go back to Outlook, it'll be on version 530 for the add-in. And you should not get the password option. Okay, looks like I'm back up and running. Anne, do I have to run anything separately to do the calendar sync? It should, it'll remember everything you had set before. It's just, I forget what the technical reason, there was something with older versions as as far as how they connected, it had to change. So if you're on a much older version, that's why it wasn't able to connect. But all your settings, like calendar sync, activity writing, password, all of that remains the same. So I don't see stuff for today that I have in the activity list now, but that will do it over time? It should. Yeah, it should. If you look on your Peace Recruiter ribbon, there's an activity queue option. Activities. Yeah, I see you can see our under action. Yeah, and what happens is it's going to have So in the activity queue area of the piece or critter ribbon of Outlook, you'll see that number is going to climb and drop, climb and drop, but it's probably going to take a while while they fully catch up. I'm not sure I'm looking in the right spot here. I see It's after you see like selected message and options. So I believe it's about a little bit more than halfway over. I think almost like two-thirds of the way over. I have PCR mail, config, portal, info, reports, action, and records. Let me see. Let me open mine up. Oh, PCR activities, activity queue 960, 959. Yeah, that's going to climb and drop for quite a bit, probably, because it hasn't been connected for a long time. Okay, so I'll just check back later, then. Yeah, once it sits steadily at zero, then you know it's caught up. I said 940 something and dropping. Okay. It might be a little bit slower while it's doing that. Too much slower, but you might see a little slowness in the beginning. Okay. That should be fine. All right. Thank you. You are welcome. Have a great week. You too. All right. Thanks. Bye-bye. Hey, Gary....
