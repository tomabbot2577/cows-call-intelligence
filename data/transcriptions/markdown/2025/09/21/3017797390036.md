## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, Rick. It's Robin again. Hey, Robin. Can you go back to that screen share invite that I sent you? I can, yeah. Okay. I don't know if you saw an email. One thing led to another, and I started questioning. I'm like, hmm. I don't know if you saw my other email. And I said that I am surprised it didn't go into the default company. And then that made me think, like, what happened if it was orphaned? Well, I found your database doesn't even have a default company, which is usually like a company record with a fake name set as the default. So when you do have a situation where you're bringing in a resume or apparently maybe a V-card where you don't have a company, it puts the person into that company. It's also usually if you have the job board, like we don't show them what companies, we don't let them create companies. So those people would go into what's called your default company. and your database doesn't seem to have had one for years. So it looks like you had one called Canada this years ago, but it was deleted. So what I'm going to do is create a default company and then have you try somebody else that was at Kirkland because apparently those V cards from that site is not giving you the company name and we could try it again. And I'm thinking this could be it. Which one do you want me to sign on to? The latest, the 1113? I sent it to you what time did I send this to you are you two hours behind me I'm Eastern I sent it to you I sent it to you at 1.33 yeah click on join with Google Meet in that in that invite okay ask to join okay Oh, I clicked the button. There we go. There we go. Okay. All right. So I'm going to have you click share screen at the bottom of your window. But make sure you use entire screen. Right. Okay. So let's, you can minimize this meet screen. We just don't want to close it. Otherwise, it kicks you out of the meeting. But you can minimize it. Okay. Now let's go over to your Peace Recruiter database. Okay. One minute. I need to go here. One minute. Oh. So that's the meet window. Yeah, so do a new tab. Yeah. Okay, let's have you log in. Okay, so here's what I'm going to have you do. click company on the main toolbar click the plus symbol right a couple icons over for the right from basic search one more over which one the plan looks to add yeah we're going to add a company and you're just going to give it something simple like candidate or just whatever it's like a fake record with a company name like a company record with a fake name. So we're going to put... You can either call it candidate, you could call it default, whatever you want to put in there. Okay. Default. Okay. Now see over at the very far right under group three where it says default company, change that field to default. Okay. So we only want one default company in a database. So there There should only be one record at any time where that field is set to default. Go ahead and hit save. Because even if you're like parsing a resume, if you don't pick a company, for example, it puts them into the default. So let's go back over to that website. What was it called? Kirkland. That was the one that was not giving you company names. Right. Okay. And this could explain why you were maybe having at least a problem with this page's V cards. Because if they're not giving you the company in the V card and you don't have a default, there's nowhere for that person. Basically, we can't have any orphaned records. Everybody needs a home. So that's kind of what the default company is. Okay. And are we going for that specific person? It doesn't matter. I just want to see anybody from this company. Okay. Yeah, let's go to Nicola. Let's do the V-card option. Because I think those other ones were in different companies, so I think it was just a difference in this, having a company or not. Let's hit open. Okay. see how this one did not give you a company let's for now go ahead and just see if this was the issue let's go to piece recruiter okay I just want to see if she goes in now yeah that we have a default hit synchronize and let me refresh it was her name Nicola dag did you come in yep she came in that's exactly what it was okay so let's have you go over to your PCR database okay Okay. Okay. Go to My PCR and go to New Names and hit that option where it says 7, the new names. Okay. Or just click on her name. Or just click on her name. Okay. So basically what's going on now, she's in a company you don't want her in, right? You wanted her really in Kirkland. What you could have done is type Kirkland into that V-card, and then we would have been fine. Since she's now in the wrong company, but we do have a company record for Kirkland, follow those icons to the right of her name. It's right after you're customized. It's called Change Company. Looks like an office building. It looks like an office building. There you go. Okay. now type in Kirkland because you do have the company record in your database and then hit search and well actuall...
