## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Lori Smith calling from Chris Churzo and Associates. We've been trying to get our logos changed over, and we've been having some trouble between the signature lines on bulk emails and the stationeries, and things are kind of a mess. I was hoping you could walk us through that, and I was also hoping I could get my virtual assistant on the line with us so that she would learn as we go. Sure. Yeah, absolutely. And so we'll patch her in on the phone and then you're going to send me like an email with a screen share that we can do. Is that correct? Yeah, we could do that. That sounds good. Okay, cool. Give me just a minute while I patch her in. Okay. Okay. Okay, I think we've got everybody on the call now. Thanks so much. Awesome. So I just emailed you, Lori, a link to click on, and that'll let you join a screen share meeting with me and you can forward that email to anyone else so they have the link as well. Okay. Ashley, I'm forwarding you that email now. And this is Garrett that we're talking to. Hello. Hi. Hi. Okay. Join the meeting. Once you join the meeting and everybody's there, we could just use the audio in the meeting and then hang up the phone, or we can just use the phone and not connect to audio. It's totally up to you. We will need to just use the phone because I'm in a tire shop and I don't have my headset on my computer. Oh, that works. Okay. So, yeah, we will. So when you're in that meeting, just say continue without audio. if a pop-up appears so we could just use the phone as the audio. Okay so it's showing audio so I think I'm okay. Yeah okay all right so if you want you can share your screen down at the bottom with the blue share button whoever wants to share their screen and there might be an option for entire screen. That would work. Okay, cool. That's loading. Yep, I can see that. All right. If you want to jump into PCR and... Go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, go ahead. So you were saying it was an issue with the email signature when you're sending bulk emails or just any email? It's a combination of things. I don't know, Ashley, did you test Rashmi's personal email one or not? No. And I asked her to send me a test and she's working in today, but I thought that I, so basically Garrett, for your knowledge, we've, we've our branding has been updated. So I'm just trying to clear out any use of the old logo. So I updated, you know, what I thought was any template that we had, like the form letters and all of that. So that's, I see. as they stand now to a place where they're they're sending properly I'm pretty confused the last thing she did she didn't have the right stationery on there and so she ended up cutting and pasting and it would be really unprofessional so to make sure she's got a template for these name letters that that works you know okay we just go in and we click on it's just some good one and maybe one of the problems too that i wasn't um because i'm not as familiar with pcr as um the rest of the team is but i think one of the things too is like if we have all of these like letters that can be reused and then she is using those well then i don't get my new stationery yeah exactly and we don't want her to reinvent the wheel because like the the content of the message is correct. It's just the layout of like the old logo and the old signature are still on there. So we want to know the easiest way to get that updated. So what we want to do, I just pulled up like this name letter and a new one. I want a stationary pop-up here so that she doesn't have to think and it's got, you know, the right stuff on it. So it's pulling a blank right now. So she's been cutting and pasting and copying off of old letters. We want to change that. We want to make about the signatures and the stationery is updated with a new logo. Okay. So when you're in this screen here where you're adding a new letter, in your form letters there's something called an insert field that you could put in that says system. I think if you just start typing the word signature in backspace where it says system print date. Yeah, right there. System current user email signature. If that's somewhere in your form letter, it'll reference whatever you have set as your email signature. Unless you have stationary turned on, stationary will override that. So people use either stationary or email signatures like an either or a lot of the times. So I've seen a lot of customers just prefer to turn off all stationary, delete all that out, and just use a combination of this insert field on your form letter and then have your email signature updated so it can reference just your email signature, if that makes sense. Yeah, I'm not sure how that works with the username, because if I'm going into a form letter, like here, we just put it in, right, and there's no logo or anything, right? So it looks like my email signature has not been updated at al...
