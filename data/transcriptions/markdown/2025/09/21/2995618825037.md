## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello. Hello. Is this JP? It is. This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good. How are you doing? Pretty well. Pretty well. I talked with Brian Kane. He said that you reached out and we're looking to get a demo set up of our PCRM. And he's out of the office for a couple days, so he wanted me to give you a call, see if I could get you scheduled tomorrow to take a look at it. Okay. Okay. Yeah, what time are you setting tomorrow? I could do 10 a.m. or noon Eastern. Either one of those would work. Let's do 10. Okay. So Friday at 10, and I will send over – I've got your email here. I will send over a meeting invite with a Zoom, and we can speak tomorrow at 10 a.m. It takes maybe a half hour to run through it and just kind of show you around. Yeah. Yeah, I'm definitely – so we've been using PCR for like three or four years, so we're not strangers to it. So I want to learn about that, and I also want to learn about the sequencing. Like we had talked about that. Is that what it's called? Yeah, the sequencing. Yeah, the sequencing is part of the premium package of PCR. Yeah. Yeah, so it sounds like the PCRM is kind of like a simpler version of PCR, if I understand that correctly. It is. It's a little bit simpler to look at, a little bit simpler to click through. It does include some additional, like, deals, tracking features, simpler sequencing, but it also includes the same sequencing that the current version has as well. Okay. All right. Yeah, then we'll plan on going through that and the premium if you can do both. Sure. Because I'd like to kind of compare because I guess we have kind of the basic version of it. I thought we had sequencing, and we just weren't using it, but that's not the case. We don't have it. You have premium before sequencing was around, thus it wasn't included in your premium. So you kind of have premium junior probably because sequencing is a newer feature, but we can talk about what the sequencing is and the PCRM. Take a look at the whole thing. Okay. Yeah, there were workflows of whatever we looked at. And, like, there was a way that you could put people into, like, basically, like, a number of, like, steps. Like, you could set that up. We never did it, but, yeah, we'll just plan on talking about those two different options. We'll go from there. Absolutely. I'll send that over in a little bit, and we can speak tomorrow at 10. All right. Sounds good. All right. Thanks, sir. Bye-bye. Talk to you then. Bye-bye....
