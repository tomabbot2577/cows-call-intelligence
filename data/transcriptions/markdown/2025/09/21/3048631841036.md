## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Ooh, Tyler. This is Ryan at KVAS1. I think you're going to be upset with answering the phone, and I'm sorry for this. Oh, what's going on, Ryan? So, I've got an office. It's AgriSearch. Let me see if I can find the ODBC. Hold on. I had it here a second ago. Yeah, it's just AgriSearch. A-G-R-I, search. they had an employee with the username of H. Wilburn that did some imports that overwrote a whole bunch of records. And they're trying to figure out the best way to go about either undoing it or restoring back the information that was overwritten or what their best line of options other than just going hand in hand one by one to figure out what all she changed. So, do we know when the imports happened? The one that she sent us for reference was August 21st of last year. Oh. I guess they're just now catching it. So. Um. I don't even know if we have backups. that go back that far. That's... We'd have to pull, like, archived backups to go back that far, and that's going to be a very pricey process. Yeah. So do we have a way to pull maybe just, like, a list of what she imported and changed that still require the archived backups? So we can always do an activity search. For the import activity and using that user's username within like a specific time range and add those names to a roll up. Because anytime you do an important information's changed, it does. There is a change log. so let me so you said August 24th of 24 yeah that's the one that you sent us for references is that one I think the problem is they don't know how far reaching the problem is so they don't know the best way to go about telling us you know this is the date these are the people kind of thing yeah I mean I mean, we could always go, like, do, like, a year. Okay. So what would be the best way? Like, I'm talking about, like, the activity search for a year. Kind of see... What's today, the 11th? The 12th. Start the 12th, yeah. What was the username? H. Wilburn. Let me just exclude activity type. Yeah, activity type is just import. And let's just go back. Has this person been with them a while? uh well she's not there anymore uh but I believe so so I went back I did 12-1 2023 to 8-12 2025 and I got the same as doing it from like last year of 835 records okay so I'm doing this along with you here so I'm doing order by date entered. It looks like she did some... Yeah. Yeah, it looks like August 5th, 2024 is... It looks like the latest date. Mm-hmm. But there's also an import in there from November... In November 19th. Sorry, go ahead. Yeah, the November 19th. Can I – will PCR let me export the search, activity search? So you can't – I think I lost you. Still there?...
