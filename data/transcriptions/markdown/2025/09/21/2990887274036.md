**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Greetings.

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** You've reached Bob Meissner's cell phone.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Kindly leave a message.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** Thank you.

**[0:08] Speaker_00:** At the tone, please record your message.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options.

**[0:16] Speaker_01:** Good afternoon, Bob.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** It's Jim Lombardo with the PC Recruiter.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** I wanted to give you a quick call.

**[0:21] Speaker_01:** I got your email and your voicemail.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** I wanted to return that and just kind of touch base confirm receipt.

**[0:26] Speaker_01:** Let you know.

**[0:27] Speaker_01:** I hate to see you go, but I wish you the best of luck.

**[0:30] Speaker_01:** And I will go ahead and get a ticket in queue to get your cancellation underway.

**[0:37] Speaker_01:** So we can get that closed down.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** I'm trying to find the email here.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** So we can close that down.

**[0:43] Speaker_01:** Did you need a return?

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** Did you need a backup of the database at all?

**[0:47] Speaker_01:** If so, let me know and I can provide that.

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** I think there's a $175 cost to get it and they make it available to download if you wish.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** But if not, I will close it.

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** It looks like any agreement you had was six months.

**[1:05] Speaker_01:** It's up in July, so you should be all set there.

**[1:07] Speaker_01:** No early termination at all.

**[1:09] Speaker_01:** I'll go ahead and get the ticket in.

**[1:11] Speaker_01:** Give me a quick call.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** We'll touch base before everything's shut down.

**[1:13] Speaker_01:** I'm going to make it like the end of this month, the 27th-ish, maybe the 30th.

**[1:18] Speaker_01:** I'll make the cancellation date so it'll properly shut down that day before it would auto renew in July.

**[1:23] Speaker_01:** My direct line is 440-856-0314.

**[1:28] Speaker_01:** please reach out if there's anything that we need.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** If we don't speak, it's been a pleasure having you as a customer.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** I appreciate it over the years and I wish you the best of luck.

**[1:37] Speaker_01:** You take care, Bob.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** Okay, bye bye.
