## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Connie Rose, and I'm a new employee today for, actually, it's under Alexander Hamilton, but parent company, Financial Recruiters International. And I have a spreadsheet with instructions, and I have downloaded a lot of things, but it doesn't look right to me. so I want to go over with you. You might be able to screen share with me. It doesn't look like what I'm looking for in PC Recruiter, and I've never used PC Recruiter as a software before. So how can we get connected with UPC Share Screen and I can show you what I've downloaded and show you my spreadsheet with the record? If you just go to a new tab in your browser and then go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And there's just join a meeting. Perfect. And I can give you a meeting ID whenever you're ready. I'm ready. Okay. That's 517-040-941. 517-040-941, correct? Perfect, yep. Hit join. Open range extension. Here we go. Come up on another screen. Okay, perfect. I see you joined. You can hit the mute button at the bottom left so there's no echo since we're already on the phone. I'm trying to move it to my screen. That's where most of it is. Okay. There we go. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Where's the screen? I've lost you. Oh, are you still on the RingCentral meeting? Can you still see that? Can you still hear through the phone? Yeah, I still hear through the phone. That's really weird because I just clicked over to RingCentral, I mean not RingCentral, PC Recruiter, and then it tells me to open RingCentral again. That's weird. And I checked always from this browser. That's crazy. I think you're still on the RingCentral meeting. It just might be open in your RingCentral app now, or it could just be one of your browser tabs. Let's see what this has done. It's not in the browser tab. Open RingCentral. So I'm on my app. Oh, here it is. Let me get my browser. When you hop from, I'm running three monitors, so. Okay. I don't know why I did that. It minimized. Okay, I did hit mute. Okay, so then if you're looking at the RingCentral meeting, just hit that blue share button at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Oh, I got a call coming in from Kevin. Okay, I can hold. Okay, thank you. Hi, Kevin. Kevin? Okay, you were, the volume wasn't high, so I missed what you were saying. That's okay. I'm setting up your email right now in PCR. Okay, cool. and I need to know that your passwords are accurate on line 21 and on line 18. Let me take a look but I'm pretty sure because I've been in that. Yes, because I've, yes, I've used these I haven't set up Alexander Raymond yet but I've set up financial recruiters and I have used that password. Alright. And I will use, I will use the one on Raymond James but I'm Raymond James, what's that? No, I mean, not Raymond James. That's another staffing agency. Alexander Raymond. I'm sorry. They're not a staffing agency. They're actually Raymond James is the broker dealer that we actually borrow people from. I've spoken with him before. So, yeah, just. All right. So, community. Connie at Alexander Raymond. That password is not working. Oh, I need your password for... I know what you mean. I know what you mean. It can't be for Alexander Raymond. Right. All right. Let me see. Let me see. Next. Okay. Okay, do me a favor and go find out what your password is for Connie at AlexanderRaymond.com. I've got it right here. I'll give it to you. Put it in the sheet on 21B. Yeah. Ah, so we changed it. Well I don't know what it's been, it's been just a day, but that's under financial. That's right, that's why we have this page. That's right, that's under financial. And Recruit Today, 778-POUND. Not working. I mean, Recruit Today, 778-POUND. No. Okay, hang on a minute. I'm kind of crazy right now because I got a guy on hold that called me when he saw me. Who's on hold? I called support on PC Recruiter because I installed it, but it didn't look right. And I know what you want, so I'll fix it, and I'll call you back. Don't call me. Just put it in the space 31D. That's what I'm going to do. Okay. Okay. You there? Are you there? Can you hear me now? Yes. I knew what he wanted. So we got off the phone and I'm going to enter some passwords for him. Usually when I'm involved in something like this, I hear from him and it's a distraction. But, you know, that's the way it goes. Got it. Can you see my screen now? Yeah. Can you hit the mute button at the bottom left? We'll just go through phone again. And I'm going to be putting in some passwords here for him, okay? I'll put it on mute right now. There we go. And can you still hear me through phone? Okay, good. All right. So yeah, I can see your screen. And so we were looking at what did you want to show me on your screen related to PCR? Okay. This is where I'm at. It's in the Google Workspace. And I really don'...
