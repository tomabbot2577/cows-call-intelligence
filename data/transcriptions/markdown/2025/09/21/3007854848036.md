 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, this is Ernie Bivona. I am trying to set up the email for a new user. Mm-hmm. And I'm not sure. I'm into email setup. Email alias list goes to me, not to him. So how do I set up his email? so I hit add set the idea so are you logged in as that other user ah let me go log in as the other user that might so first what you'll want to do before you go log in as the other user click the three dots on the type top right hand corner of PC Recruiter or not in PC Recruiter of your Chrome window. Hold on. Yep. And then do new incognito window. Now, he's also having trouble with PC capture tool doesn't work on his iPad for whatever reason. It won't work on an iPad. MacBook, MacBook, sorry. Anyway, let's get this other thing set up and then we'll go to the MacBook. Yeah, so click where it says new incognito window. Got that. and then go to PCR and log in as that user. Okay. And then you'll go to the system, email setup, email alias list. Hi, how are you? Hold on. System. Where did I see you? Oh, there it is. Okay, email alias list. The other user was in there, so I just hit and just change it to him. Yeah, so click that little pencil. Yeah. And then do you have that person's email password? I think so. Okay. And then are you using, like, Gmail? Are you using Office 365 and Outlook? Office 365. Okay. So when you click that pencil, you'll switch the from and reply to addresses? Well, I'm going to type in his email address. Yep, and the from and reply to. and then after that you'll hit that sign in with Microsoft button hold on make sure I got his name installed right Hold on. Okay. All right. All right, all right. Sign with Microsoft, right? Yep. And then am I putting in my Microsoft sign-in? Well, it should be the same as his. No, it'll be different. It'll be his email address and his email address password. Do you know your email address password? Yeah. All right. So wait a minute. Am I signing? Now I got this thing that says sign in with Microsoft. It's on my computer. So who's password? So this is connecting his email to his username. All right. So Christopher at Starboard. Okay. And what's your password? For my Microsoft account? Well, for the email. For that email? Okay. So capital. Just give it to me. Capital F. Y5 HTT FY5 HTT That should work. Alright, I have the sign-in request. Hold on. I need that password. Huh? Sign in Enter the number shown Now what do I do? It should wait and it'll load you Hold on Okay You're all good Information requested Accept I think we're good Test connection Yep unsuccessful which database is this user in industrial and what's their username Christopher no their username for PC Recruiter like when they log into PC CFP let me pop in here that didn't work Okay, so the reason that's not authenticating is because SMTP authentication for that user needs to be turned on in the Microsoft account Do you have someone that normally does the Microsoft account stuff for you? Yeah Okay, so what I'm going to do He's getting emails on Outlook Yes, but in order to connect to third-party softwares like PC Recruiter, there's something that needs to be enabled in that account. Uh-huh. What I'm going to do is I'm going to send you over the instructions for it, and you can just give it to your Microsoft guy, and he can turn it on for you, and then that'll be good to go. It'll start authenticating then. Mm-hmm. Okay. So what I'll do is I'll email these instructions over to you. Okay. Thank you. Which email address works best for you? Earn the Vona at marketing-sales.com. Perfect. So I just sent those on over to you. So whoever does your Microsoft account can just follow those instructions and turn it on. All right.
