## 📝 Summary

 Jonas hey Jonas it's a Jim Lombardo with PC recruiter how are you this is who this is Jim with PC recruiter uh-huh yeah I'm doing well how you doing Jim I am well I'm well just wanted to give you a quick call see how everything was going with PC recruiter I kind of got notified your training ticket hadn't had any activity in 30 days plus so just thought I'd make sure everything was going well with PC recruiters if there's anything more that you needed or just check in yeah no everything's been going great the reason I haven't had anything is I've been working with Garrett Garrett's awesome by the way I like him a lot he's been very helpful and so I told Garrett in our last conversation that I knew enough now with PCR to be dangerous and really I'm in my fifth week now actually in the business doing the job and using PCR and I don't have any questions right now as far as what I need to be able to do at this point, but I did tell him, though, that some of the other stuff that we've covered previously that maybe I wasn't using on a daily basis, I may need to schedule a follow-up just to kind of refresh on some of that stuff, as well as maybe some other features that I know that's out there that I've never touched before.  Maybe I can add that in as well, but we both agreed that maybe we could save some of my training time for that purpose, and so that's kind of where we are right now.  Great.
