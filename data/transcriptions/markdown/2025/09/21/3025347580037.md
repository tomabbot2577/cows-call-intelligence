## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, this is Ernie Bivona. I am home, and I cannot, when I go into LinkedIn, and I want to send a message from somebody, it shows me a little, little line, and it doesn't really allow me to type a message. I've got to go in and out of PCR a couple of times. I'm not sure what the issue is. Okay, so you're saying you're in PCR trying to send the message or you're in LinkedIn? PCR. Oh, okay. Okay, I see. So you might need to just clear cache. I can walk you through that. So click the, let's see, yeah, click the three dots at the top right of your browser. Yeah. And we're looking for, it says more tools kind of towards the bottom. Yep. Nope. Cut out there. Can you still hear me? Yep. Okay. Oh, there you are again. Sorry, I think you cut out for a second. So you're going to the three dots. You're going to more tools than developer tools. Something strange is going on with the phone audio here. Let me check my Internet connection. I think I'm connected. try talking again it's coming kind of robotic sounding for the phone okay now you're back to normal awesome so yeah if you just went to more tools and then developer tools it'll open up some kind of coding and stuff that you could just ignore and then go up to the web address up at the top of your screen and right-click on the refresh button to the left of that, which is an arrow in a loop. If you right-click on it, you'll see empty cache and hard reload as an option. Click on that. And it shows... options. Let's see. Where would I see empty cache? So it's if you right click on that arrow in a loop icon, it's to the left of your web address. Oh, empty, okay. There it is, yep. That will slowly reload your page. And once it reloads, you can close those developer tools. Well, is it done? How do I know it's done? It'll kind of just go blank for a second and then refresh and reload the PCR page you're on. It might take a minute, but once that's all loaded again, you could try sending a message and see if that fixed the issue. I think that usually covers it most of the time. Let me get out of PCO1. Okay, let me go to a name. Well, that guy didn't even load from PCR. That's terrible. Click to update. He didn't even load. Oh, so you're in LinkedIn again, rather than PCR? No, I went to PCR looking for the guy. He's not there. So let me get rid of this and search. but it said he's it said want to update so that means he's there but where is he I have that there is no that's in let's try it submit all right now let's and the other problem having is right now let's see if he's in every time I go to zoom info it doesn't even give me normal link in normal link Jenna okay now he's in twice all right so give me a break why is he in choice it's probably with the capture tool you would just select the person that you want to update if you don't select that person during the capture process it'll create a second record. So it's kind of, I think, once you click on click to update or click to add, that's the screen where you'll get to choose what record you want to update. Now it's working. All right. The visual part is appearing for the messages? Okay. Excellent. All right. Anything else you were having trouble with? yeah when I go to hit the zoom info now it gives me a login okay before it wasn't even giving me a login oh it's working now maybe that was the problem too alright let me run because I got these other this guy never responded alright thanks have a great day...
