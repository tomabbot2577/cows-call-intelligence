## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hey, Jim. Steve Abbey. How are you? I'm well. Steve, how are you? I'm good. How was your summer? It went by fast, huh? It sure did, for sure. So cold now. A couple things. Update on the business. We hired an investment banker to help us sell the business. and he is talking to people outside of the space. There's a lot of interest for somebody to come in and expand and build this business. And so we are working on that. We're hoping to have some type of clarity on the sale before the end of September. Again, all this is subject to change. because this business seems to change, like, in a moment's notice. But the intent is to try and find a buyer and a new home, you know, sometime between now and the end of the year. Okay. That's the goal. And, you know, we are, you know, everybody that we've talked to is very much so encouraged to preserve the employees and make sure that employees know that they have a job and probably have better opportunities and more opportunities to make money. Okay. That's good to hear. So that's that update. Second update is that our buddy Marty, when he went over to Pierre to ask him to look at this contract, I guess, is this the same bank contract that he asked Pierre to look at? I think it is. I believe it is. Okay. So what that triggered when Marty did that, which was a no-no, that triggered that no contract is negotiable here to forward. So we are not going to change the contract as written. What we will do, what I will do, agree to do, is that they write an addendum that's not, you know, 500 pages, but like less than a couple paragraphs. They have some points that they want to add that's important for them that will help them write the deal. We're happy to review that and, if it's reasonable, approve that. Okay. So the bank, you know, for basically a $200 a month deal, you know, we're not going to spend $5,000 in legal fees. Peer costs us $700 an hour. Oh, for sure. It's at least a three- or four-hour process to even have them look at this thing. That makes sense. We're not in the business of giving money away. We're in the business of trying to make money. Yes, we want new customers, but at the cost of paying more than what the customer is paying us, no. And I guess you've got to tell them that. If they don't like it, I don't care. We don't usually get that many of them. It just so happens there's another one we're viewing, too, that I'm going to send to you and Bill. So as Bill let me know the other day. Don't even bother sending it to me. Don't even bother sending it to me. The answer is no. Okay. So I'll just tell them if there's anything they can throw in addendum, we'll run a pass. Yeah. So, hey, if there's some changes you want, you can put it in addendum after you lessen two paragraphs, and we'll look at that, but we're not changing the contract whatsoever. So you just tell them that it's a non-negotiable. Unless they want to pay the legal fees, it's a $10,000 deposit. For sure. Yeah, because we don't get. They're not happy to review it if they want to pay for the review. Okay. Yeah, we don't get $30,000 a year. Hey, look, if you want to change this whole contract, we're happy to do that, but we're not going to pay. We don't make enough money on the deal to pay a lawyer to do that. I would just say we would need a $5,000 legal review deposit. Sure. We're happy to change it, but it's like we don't have the margin in this deal. You talk to guys, look, I don't have the margin in this deal. management's not going to give it to me because if you ask me to review this contract, you know, it's a $3,000 bill just to have them look at it. And then if you go, you know, one go around, it's a $5,000 bill. So if you want to do that, we're happy to do that. Just, you know, give me your credit card number and I'll charge you $5,000 for contract review and we'll do that. For sure. No, that makes sense. and so if otherwise you know what we're willing to do is leave the contract as it is and you know there's a couple myths that you have you want to put an addendum I'll be happy personally to look at it if it looks reasonable I'll just accept that and not send that to peer right because peer doesn't want the contract changed and neither do I so but peer never said for sure no no that makes total sense do you understand what's going on here mr lombardo yeah for sure i think if you read between the lines you can get deals done you just got to do it a different way yeah no that's no problem at all it's easier than reviewing and red lines and everything like that so yeah that's all yeah no red lines no nothing don't know if somebody says they're going to review the contract say well you can review it all you want um you know the Management wants a $5,000 deposit to review your changes. Sure. Okay. I got it. Or, you know, here's what I would suggest. Management will look at an addendum that's less than two paragraphs, five sentences per paragraph, meaning there's no more than ten senten...
