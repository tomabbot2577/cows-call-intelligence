## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm calling because I wanted some help or some direction on how I can run. There's a couple of different statistics that we want to search for in our database or be able to run a report on. And I'm kind of wondering if we already have them, if they already exist or if they need to be built. or, you know, just, so I was just wanting to know if you could help with that. Sure. Let me jump into your database here. So let's see. Search console. Okay. All right. So what kind of a report were you looking to run? Well, so I'm imagining it's a position report. So basically you want to be able to run a report of all the candidates presented during a certain time period, let's say in the past year, that made it onto the first interview in the pipeline. Okay. Okay. First interview. Let's see. So if I go to pipeline reports, applicant tracking. OK. So we can do a report called an applicant tracking report that you can put a date range and then you can specifically point to certain steps in the pipeline. You can do the whatever step you named for when you present the candidate and then also to the first interview step. and once you generate that report you could kind of eliminate the names that only appear in the presented step kind of in the Excel file and you'll be left with people who have hit pull I think that'd be the best way to do it so go to reports in the main menu of PCR and then pipeline reports on the left and then applicant tracking report on the right. And this will give you the search params heading up at the top when that's expanded. It gives you a select interview date range kind of on the right there. That would be where you put in the date range there. And then the filters heading below it when that's expanded you can go to the one called filter by interview type slash status this would if you just click the little pop-out icon on the right ask you to choose which pipeline you're using so which set of steps it has a legacy by default but most likely you're using a different one like there's one here called biz dev one called default and then one called search oh yeah I think it's the I think it's a default that we're using okay that makes sense and then just check the box next to whichever ones you want to see in your report so it's probably going to be that sent to hiring manager and first in-person interview. And you can even check the second in-person interview if you want that included. And then hit select. And then I think the only other thing to look at is there's a filter on the right called filter by job status. That has A, comma, I in there by default. I would clear that out in case there's any positions that are filled or closed. you want those to show up too. So you could just leave the filter by job status empty. And I think that's all we would be looking at filter wise. What's the date range you were looking at again? I'll just run it on my end. Well, just my example. Yeah, we were just going to do like the last year. So I was just going to run one from like 7-1-2024 to today. Perfect. All right. And then once you fill in those filters at the top right, click the three horizontal lines, and you should have the option to – first off, you could just view it with the PDF view mode option. That'll just open it in a new tab. But most of the time, you'll want to export it to Excel or to a CSV file so that you can manipulate and rearrange the data. But I'll just do PDF view mode to make sure you're getting – Okay, so that says no records found. Let me see. Something's different there then. Let's try this. I'm going to try the other pipeline called search to see if that one brings back results. Okay. Let's try that. We really don't use the other ones, honestly. They're kind of experimental. Gotcha. Okay, so the search, that brought back a lot of pages, about 47 pages. So I think the default one is actually the one that you don't use when it comes to pipelines. I think you used the one called search. So you just want to adjust the interview type statuses to include the search pipeline. And then I selected the step called presentation, and then the three interview steps, client interview, second interview, third interview. and it brought back 47 pages in the PDF view mode, but you can always export it to Excel. Okay, so really quick, tell me again. So up in the search params, it's just the date range that I'm working with, right? Yeah. And the filters, I can check that box down there at the bottom left that says include only positions with interviews? So that would be, it's using the word interview kind of like the old way PCR used to use it. That means include only positions where people have hit a step. So any step in the pipeline is considered a quote unquote interview. Oh, okay. So then I can uncheck that? Yeah, it doesn't matter if that's checked or unchecked, I guess it would just, I guess it wou...
