## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Christina. Hey, Christina. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. Returning to your call. How are you? Hi. Good. How are you? I'm all right. I'm all right. Yeah, so to answer your question, nothing will be disabled or turned off until you tell us to. So even though you have a couple databases and that Fusion Recruiter LLC one I think is the one that you're getting a backup of, it's still going to be here in PC Recruiter and really it'll still be there indefinitely as long as you still have two paid users even if they're not using it it's still going to be there left just as it was. Okay all right that's I just want to make sure while everyone is actively working I we're not not disrupting them inadvertently so I wanted to be sure of that thank you for the clarification. And then the other question that was posed to me was, so we'll do this initial data file backup, what's the poll? Is a second one, are we able to have a second one pulled just for anything as kind of a final for the legacy database as we, you know, finalize the transition over? Yeah, you can do that. Usually that's how kind of what we converted that into PC Recruiter, usually they'll get an initial data backup. Then after the conversion is done, they'll get one more. So you can certainly, because you might still have people still logging into PC Recruiter and using it for another couple of weeks or month or whatever. So when you're ready, just request, hit me with an email again. I can put in another request. We'll have to have another form and it's another 175 for the data return, but you can get another one and it'll be current as of that date. Gotcha. Okay. All right. Perfect. Okay. Is there anything else that I should be aware of as part of this transition? I don't think so. As of right now, nothing would change until you email me to drop down to two users. Then the old database is still going to be there. You're just not, the users aren't really paid to be able to use it, so they shouldn't really log in and they wouldn't really want to be since they're kind of using something new. But just once they start using something new, pop me an email, I can drop you down to two. No problem there. to set on the next monthly invoice, and then you're good to go for that. And then that's the next backup. Just let me know. Sounds good. Okay. And I know you had asked me a question around what we were switching to and perhaps, you know, what some of the features were. And I'm happy to share if you had a few minutes that you wanted to talk through while we're making that change. So we ultimately made the decision to move over to LOXO. And it was predicated by different platforms that we're using today and trying to consolidate having so many different contracts. So we had SourceWhale for our outreach. We had HireEasy as an additional sourcing tool. We're using standalone phones and things like that. and we started to look at options for being more efficient. We were struggling with PCR's ability to – the sequencing was a bit complicated. And as with other platforms, integrations with LOXO just felt like kind of the right next step for us. But we have really enjoyed working with PCR, and I have really enjoyed working with your team and the account managers over the years. Everyone has been very, very helpful. Great, great, yeah, just kind of consolidating everything into one. I get it, I get it, I appreciate you letting me know. And always, if anything should not work out or it goes wrong or it isn't all you thought it would be, let me know, and you can pop back over here very easily since you still have a couple users for a little while. So it should be really easy. Great, I will. And I am happy to continue to promote PCR2. We've had a great experience just with the right steps for our business at this point, but I still think PCR is a great tool. awesome awesome I appreciate that I appreciate that's all I can ask for and like I said any anything you need when you're ready to drop your users need another backup come right to me and I can get you helped out all right thank you Jim appreciate your help thank you all right take care bye-bye bye...
