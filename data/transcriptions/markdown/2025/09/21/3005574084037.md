## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me at Seagram's Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Dottie Summerfield with Summerfield Associates in Memphis. I have a question for you, sir. Sure. Online job postings that are on our website that come back to PCR. And I know I should be able to figure this out, but I can't. people are asking how they can attach like a cover letter and things like that. Is there a way that that can be in the online posting or allow them to do that? Yeah, absolutely. We can actually, it's nothing on your end that you should know how to do, so no problem. We will actually have our web developer kind of readjust your application, you know, the form that they fill out, the applicants fill out as they're signing up for the position. So let me actually create a ticket. I didn't know whether to start with a ticket or call you. It's always easier for me to call. Yeah, just call, and then I'll just start the ticket here. So what is the best email address to get back to you at? dsummerfield, that's d-s-u-m-m-e-r-f-i-e-l-d at summerfield.net. Perfect. Okay, I will have our web developer reach out to you. And it's basically you just want a button so that they can upload a file, like a cover letter. Cover letter, yes, thank you so much. Okay, awesome. I will let Drew know and look out for an email from him. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. No problem. Have a good one. Okay. Bye-bye....
