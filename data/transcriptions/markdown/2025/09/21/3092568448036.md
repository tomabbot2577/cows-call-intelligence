 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Hey, Jim, can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All right. So, yes, I want to show you around the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter. Are you there, Luke? Do you hear me? I think I was muted. Hey, yeah, I can hear you. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah, so I want to just kind of show you around the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter, kind of show you how that works. Do you use it in all the email campaigns that you likely have already? Yeah, we use campaigns. Okay. So what the sequencing does is it's actually going to give you basically reactive campaigns almost. So that's going to give you the ability to build your own sequencing templates. So you could say that maybe – and it might even be something like a drip campaign alone. So it will just send an email, wait three days, send another, wait four days, send a third. So those are pretty much set and forget. Launch it and it will run. Or you could do something like send an email. if they open it then send them this one if they don't open it in two days put them on my call list or maybe if you use ring central you could even include a text message to be one of the steps in the sequence as well so what the sequencing does it would add a whole new button up in the main menu bar at the top of the screen so you see would add sequencing up there that's going to be where you would go to build your sequences and I think it also comes with a couple of sequences so when you go into your sequencing area it kind of opens and launches a whole new window. It's going to give you the ability to look at your templates. That's where you're able to design the sequences. And I think these two are pre-loaded. So you would get these two standard ones in there, business development, candidate engagement. Those are kind of two popular uses for the sequencing tool. And then you can go ahead and edit the branches. So this one, for example, step one is going to be a form letter. So you can kind of pick whatever form that you want in there and then you could say maybe if the email is replied to they've completed the sequence I was just trying to get a hold of them that's all I needed but if no interaction occurs in three days or you could make it four days or eight days or whatever then continue to the next step and then you're able to decide what the next steps going to be in this case it's a call so I can say that would add it to my call list so I'll show you my my kind my to-do list there. Things like calls, LinkedIn items, schedule requests, stuff like that. Those are something I have to do that's not automated. So they're going to show up on a task list, which I'll show you in just a sec. But actually then my call, what I can do is then I can select various different options. If it's connected and I select that, they're done. If I select send message, it's going to move them to the next step. Same with no answer. That's another email. so I'm able to kind of build my various different templates and I can see like some of these are going to be a little longer so you can kind of build different templates and you could say if this then go to there anything like that it's pretty simple to do and you get those two to start with so the templates are going to run on a roll-up list so a sequence runs on a roll-up list you can assign the roll-up list before you activate the sequence or you could keep the sequence always running on a roll-up list and how you'll know that a roll-up list has a sequence running on it you'll see a couple of might have the little sequencing icon there and if I hover it'll tell me what sequence is running on that roll-up list so that's going to kind of give me a heads up that if I add someone to that that roll-up they're going to start the DS stages sequence or if I add them to the account management candidates are going to start the candidate reach out sequence so they run off of a sequence there they are going to happen automatically and if you had something if it was more than a drip campaign and you had some some things you needed to do if you go into sequencing the very first thing that pops up is going to be a task list and this is going to show me that in this sequence I started with 207 people and 14 of them have since done whatever it is maybe it's open to my email that puts him on my call list okay so I can go through here and I can say I'm going to to the first one it opens up his record it's going to show some basic contact info kind of the basic record data a synopsis of his activity and then over here in the upper over in the right hand side you're going to be able to pre populate a script so if you have a specific script that's going to be part of this call populate that in there so the individual working within this task list they could...
