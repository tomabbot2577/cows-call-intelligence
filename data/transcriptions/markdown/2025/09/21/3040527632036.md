## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, this is Scott Samuels, Horizon Hospitality. Quick question. I'm trying to create a roll-up list with names on it, but I want to make sure if there's a word in someone's resume that they're omitted from the roll-up. So is there a way in keywords that I could say not a certain word? Like it's a company I don't want them to have worked for. Yeah. So if you're using the keywords box in basic search or even advanced search, you can put N-O-N-T in all caps before the term. Wait, what is it? O-O-what? Not N-O-N-T, but it's just in all caps. Oh, I thought I did that. Maybe it wasn't enough. If it's not enough, let me just try something real quick. Sure. And are you building that as part of a longer search query in that? No, no. 4763. And then... I'm not sure. Yeah, it says cannot perform a not Boolean search without any other criteria. Oh, okay. So, yeah, you would have to have, like, I guess a term in front and then the word not and then the term to exclude. What does that mean? I mean, yeah. So like you would say human resources, not manager is how it's used. There has to be something in front of not that you're actually searching for. So I want to I want to omit a company. And so I could. How would I do that? Like a company name? I don't want any anybody who's with that company to be on this list. Okay. Would it be listed in their company in PCR or just in the resumes? Okay. In the resumes, yeah. Is there an additional characteristic that these people have, like a term that we could put that you do want to include? Manager? Okay, yeah, so we could try doing manager, not company name. And is the company name more than one word or is it just a single word? Wow, that took out a lot. I put like first name John because I didn't want, you know, I just wanted to see how many first names. So it came up with like 4,600 listings of anybody in our database with first name John. And then I put manager not Aramark, and it dropped it to 2,800. So there's no way that that doesn't make a lot of sense that dropped it by 2000. So it would have to mean that everybody with the first name John does have the word manager somewhere in their resume attachments notes. And they also do not have arrow mark. So the larger list might not have had of those 2000 that were dropped. They probably didn't have the word manager. Yeah, but that doesn't make sense. I mean, if there's a – I guess what I could do is do a search and add all of the keywords in that roll-up that have the word Aramark in it and then have another list of the entire list and then say, you know, pull up one list and say not on this list or something. And that, you know what I'm saying? Okay. Yeah, so you would do an advanced list thing. I'd create a master list and then from that master list, find out who had arrow mark on it. And then when I did the whole, I'd say not on this list, and I would create a new list that took off the inner mark. Yeah, I see what you're saying. That's a good way to do it. Yeah, I guess. Okay. All right. I think I can handle that. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Bye....
