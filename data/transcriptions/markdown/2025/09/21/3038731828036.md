## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yes, and we kind of have a bad connection, and I don't know why that is. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. It's a little distorted. Okay. I've been a PC recruiter user for like 22 years, and I, you know, use my database just to maintain my data for my recruiting operation, right? I'm self-employed. And I have a question. I can't find how to get into help. My question is I want to set up the two-factor sign-in, and I've never been able to determine how to do that. But I know you've changed some things lately, and I go in and I click under the support, but I can't get in. I've never logged into your support portal. So this morning I tried to, and obviously I couldn't get in because my name and my company are already in there. So my first question is, can you help me set up my two-factor sign-in? And the second thing is, how do I sign in when I need support? I don't know how to get into your support portal. Oh, sure. Yeah, I can definitely help you with those things. So let's start with the two-factor authentication. So go ahead and log into PCR. I'm in. Perfect. Do you need my name or my company or anything? I have you pulled up as Susan with the Park Pharmaceutical Surgery. Yes, that's me. Excellent. So if you just go to System in the main menu at the top of PCR. System. It would be kind of in the main menu by MyPCR, Dame. Right, I see it. I clicked on System. Oh, excellent. Then on the left, go to Users. Okay, user. Okay. And then manage users. Perfect. Okay. And then select the username from that list you want to adjust. Okay. And then in the bottom frame on the left, go to the security icon. It's a padlock. Okay, well, mine looks different. It's at the bottom. Okay, so it says Susan J. Password. I don't know what model user means. No, and that's all it says. Okay, right. So to the left of that there should be a security padlock. Yep, perfect. Do you want me to click that? Yeah, click on that. And then there are a few headings here. You want to expand the bottom heading that says Security Policy, if it's not already expanded. Okay. And then... Oh, two-factor setup. Okay. Exactly. Yep, click on that. and then check on that top box that says enable under TOTP authentication and then configuration below that is okay yes let you know how you want to set that up. It says configuration and it says X email not configured and mobile app not active. Okay so then below that where it says allow the use of these authentication providers, check the box next to send code via email and hit reset. So that will send you a code so that you can set up two-factor authentication. Okay, so two factors was reset. Okay, so then I do enable again. Yeah, up at the top if that got disconnected go ahead and check the box for enable at the top and then it's like making me reset it again oh so so the next step would be it it will become configured I guess the email part will say configured once you jump over to your email and look at the email that was just sent to you which will complete the setup. I don't have an email yet. No email? Okay. Check one thing here. And it's you know I know y'all have my email so I get my bills. Right so this would be sent from your database rather than from us so let me check. Oh well I don't know. If the email is connected in your database once. Well, the configuration still says email not configured. I don't have – I don't send emails from my database to anybody. I just don't use that. Okay. So we'll need to set that up so that you can get the initial email. And I can – I'll show you how to do that. So let's do this. If you go back to – See, I saw it. Okay. Oh, you didn't get the email? No, I didn't. So back to what? System administrator? Go to system up at the top to kind of reopen the system settings. Okay. And then, let's see, on the left, we're looking for email setup, about the fifth or sixth option down. Right, yeah. And then on the right is outgoing mail setup. And then here we would connect to your email so that it has an email address to send that two-factor setup email. But this doesn't mean anybody's going to get emails out of my database. No, this would just be like notification emails that need set things like password resets or just, you know, general notification type emails. Okay, so this is not anything that's going to activate emails going to people in my database. Right. Yeah, it's just to do general notification type things. To me, okay. Yeah, who's your email provider? Is it Google or Microsoft Office? Outlook, Microsoft Office, yeah. Okay, at the bottom, click on Sign In with Microsoft, the black button there. And it'll prompt you to kind of log in to your Microsoft account. Oh, I have no idea what my Microsoft account is. So I guess we're not going to go anywhere with this. My IT guys do all this for me. I have no idea. I just have no clue what that is. I have no idea. I mean, at all. I mea...
