## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Robin, what's up? Oh, nothing. Just loving life. That's not the conversation. I think you heard what you wanted to hear because I don't think anybody's letting you out of a three-year contract. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no. I said to put on hold to hold on to our case in case we go through the migration in the future. I don't see any notes on that. I see, yeah, we put you on hold for $10 a month, which is cheaper than everybody else. but you have a three-year contract. Exactly. That's not how that works. I'm very surprised by your response. Yes, because it's always me. Forget that you signed a contract. Right. That has nothing to do with it. It's my fault for not letting you out of the contract that you signed. Yeah. Well, at least you didn't call me the C word. I'm just like, I can't believe these people. Like, they take personal shots at me because of what they signed. It's just humorous anymore. Yeah. I mean, at least, like, with that woman, clearly she had a lot going on. Like, that doesn't excuse it, but it wasn't just for no reason. A lot of these people, I swear, are just like, no, I just don't like you. So I'm going to say nasty, mean things because you're not doing exactly what I want you to do. Yeah. You signed a contract. This is so false. Like this one about Jim Liberto. Well, he hasn't signed in. We don't care if they sign in or not. I think this guy's using us to get a visa. Because he has to start up. Yeah, that one, I'm like, hmm. So I saw his little note. Just ignore that. We're not doing that. I am not about to let him just like. First of all, he already shouldn't have had access to the database before he really started paying us. Because that didn't make sense to me. well i remember the conversation and i might be a little off on this he's trying to get a visa but i don't think it's us i think it's to canada and they have to kind of say like like i have a business so wow yeah let me just spend two grand and say i have a business like are we getting used like you can you can start your business yeah if that part of it is really irrelevant to the contract that you signed yeah is he trying to get out of his he's not the one trying to get out of his thing you're just saying the one that jim was like oh just want to keep pushing back his billing like he paid he signed he paid because he needs that for this visa stuff well you're signed and paid and you're going to get you know we already kind of pushed it back a little bit once. Wait, wait, wait. He said that's not what Jim said in my, hold on, hold on. I must have misunderstood. So he wants to get it pushed, the next recurring push back again. Well, I thought he said that he had. I am not pushing it back. A year in advance. Is that true? but the next one he wants to push that out which means we don't get anything so what would be the next recurring in april has already pushed back a little bit we did push it back a little bit but then i want to put you back a little bit more so that means we're really not going to get another payment then even though he's not using for from april next year until like so yeah we won't have anything for basically covering april to january 2027 if we push it back even more for his next recurring like he paid up front because he needs this to get his visa stuff going like we're getting used for visas what it sounds like you're going to start a business after you're here well then you shouldn't sign a contract and it's not our problem if you're trying to get a visa you don't like we gave you access to a database that's what's in your contract and no i'm not pushing this back anymore okay hold on so it doesn't matter if you're logging in or not i don't really care there's a lot of people that don't log in and they still have to pay you signed a contract you shouldn't have signed a contract if you weren't ready and if you need this for your visa well then that's just you know an expense that you have these make keep making exceptions i'm done with it i'm done with these exceptions yeah also this is how things get all screwed up and crazy and also why does he think he gets to tell you whatever whatever whatever not in charge of him but um he shouldn't have sent a contract just for visa purposes. Well, no. Lombardo's last response to you is basically telling you just make the payment received start in January. Well, no. January 27. January 27 is what he'll write. That's not how that works. That's so stupid. I think we should make him re-sign a contract in when he starts. So let's say January. And then at that point, let's see. So he did, so April was when he originally signed up. Is that right? Yeah. Let me look at, what was the company name? It's like something weird. VXZON. I really need to go grab my readers. Yeah. He, his invoice was April 15th, 2025. Okay. Okay. So that invoice is for his ASP installation of $750, 12 months of $115 per month with a discount of 5%. So that took off $69. So he paid $2,061 on April 15th...
