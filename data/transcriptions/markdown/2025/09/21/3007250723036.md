## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. You have not... Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There are four participants in the meeting. I can hear you. Good morning. Hi, Jim. Hello. Hi, Jim. Hi. All right. All right. So I'm letting everybody get in. Is everybody in that's going to be joining or are we still waiting on anyone? I think we're all set. Okay. Very good. Very good. So I want to show you around PC Recruiter a bit this morning. I wanted to start off just by learning a little bit about what are the main things that you use in a software package now and that you would require of a new package, be it ours or anyone's. What are kind of your main features, functions, et cetera, that are absolutely must-haves? So I can make sure to cover those areas in the system as we look at the demo. Okay. I can lead off on that. So we're currently a Bullhorn customer. So we've been on Bullhorn since 2010, so a very long time. Most of the functionality of Bullhorn works well with us or for us. Some of it we find clumsy and it's a little bit harder. But the basics are, you know, we work both sides of the desk. So we recruit candidates as well as we find, we work with our client companies and getting jobs. So when we send out a candidate, we'll send the candidate through Bullhorn. We send it as a mass mail so that it can be tracked. We can see who's opening up this submittal. And then everything with Bullhorn tracks all the emails between the recruiter here at NDT and the client company. So we like to have as much information as possible and have that be as automated as possible so that our operations team can work on other things. So that's that. In terms of doing bullhorn searches, we do it, but we think that their technology is a little bit outdated and clumsy. so we're interested in really the whole gamut of what your product can offer us. Okay, perfect. Excellent. And so you're looking for something that's going to track client, companies, job openings, interviews, being able to send out candidates, track emails, all of that basic sort of information there. Okay, excellent. Excellent. So let me show you around here, and if you have questions as we go, feel free to jump right in. I am going to share my screen and you should be looking at the sign-in screen for PZRecruiter right now. Yeah, perfect, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and get myself logged in. So it's a cloud-based system like all of these systems are. You're going to be able to access it from a PC or a Mac. There's a mobile app so a lot of different ways you can access the system. Each user would of course have their own username and password and that's going to be nice because that's going to let you see who has done whatever they did in the database. So all emails are going to be stored, tracked, tagged in the database. You'll be able to see who sent the email, who entered the record, who scheduled the interview, whatever it might be. So as we go through, I'll show you kind of all that information. So once you're in PC Recruiter, the basic look and feel is going to be what you see here. Now, it's going to be configurable. You can actually pin or unpin many of the tiles in the main menu bar. You can redesign the screens, add custom fields, move fields around, so you have a lot of functionality that's going to be configured to your liking. But essentially, you're going to have a primary menu bar at the top. That's going to be your main navigation. The middle area is going to be for searching, search results and lists, and then the bottom area is going to be for the records themselves, as you would be able to navigate the system there. So that main menu bar is going to really handle a lot of your primary elements of PC Recruiter, including the names, the companies, the positions. So those are our three main record types that we handle in PC Recruiter, names, companies, positions. The names are going to be a little different than both. We are what they call single silo. So a name in PC Recruiter is going to be the name of a person you're working with, be it that they're a contact, a reference, a candidate, whatever. they're only going to have one record so if they're a contact at your client company I would mark them a contact but maybe they're also a candidate throw a resume attached to their record they're going to come up in searches so they're going to act as a name record no matter what whether or not they're a candidate or a contact but a name is a name in pcbroker we find that it helps prevent confusion duplication what have you if you need to have two email addresses linked to one record, you can certainly do that. And any emails exchanged with either or both of those addresses are going to be recorded in the activities. So that's going to work real well. So I think we go back on that because that's an important point. So Bullhorn separates it out. So if we're working with John Smith, you kn...
