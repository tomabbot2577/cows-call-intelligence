## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, you have reached Sharon at 319-930-0947. Please leave your name, number, and a message, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Hey, Sharon, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. I just actually went in. I sent you an email. But I just went in to enter the ticket to move the database, and I had already done it. I forgot I already put that ticket in. So it looks like it was moved late yesterday evening, like 630, 645, something like that. So the data should now be moved under your new Thomas AgriExec search URL. It is there, and that's what you should be using. I hope you're out of Iowa City because you shouldn't be using that one anymore. I didn't know that McKenzie had already moved it. So good news is we are ready to get the training ticket in. I'm going to do that momentarily. And I just wanted, again, to give you a quick call to make sure you were aware that your database was moved and you should be using it in the new URL right now from here forward. If you have any questions or you get this, give me a quick call, 440-856-0314....
