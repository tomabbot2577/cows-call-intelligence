## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Oh, hey, Robin. My name is Erin Monahan. I had to cancel my PC Recruiter subscription because my business was basically dying. And I thought I had it to August 5th, but I'm just reading I just had it for 30 days, like the download. But I think my contract went to August 5th. I just wanted to know if I could have it to August 5th. I wasn't even sure how to, like, download it. I needed, like, SQL or something. I don't have the money to transfer it to another database right now, but I just want to figure out how I can save it until I can afford to transfer it to another database because I think it's usually like a dollar. You'd have to – so when they provide it, you would just like have to save it to your computer somewhere. Okay. So the download's available for 30 days. Okay. I think it's been more than 30 days. I think it's been like 35 days. Okay. it might still be there. Does it allow you to still download it? Download it or not? Hold on. Let me see. Hold on. Download one. The database is still on. Why is this still on? Hold on one second here. Because it's a RAR file. It says the download one is the back file of the SQA file. Let's see. It's taking a while to download. it says archives can be extracted using the free version of WinRAR which is the archive password that can be texted to the number okay and then restored using Microsoft SQL Server Yeah you can't really use it yet unless you converted it to something else. I mean, you got the resumes in there. It's a full database copy. Okay. Let me check your account though. I mean, it's downloading. It's still six minutes left. Okay. And then, so I can just save them to my computer and I'll still be able to use, access them somehow? So the, it's just, okay. It's, well, the database, the one file is going to be like just a bunch of tables. Okay. And the other one is going to be like files. Okay. Like documents. Okay. Now let me check your thing. What did we have you listed here? Your recurring is deleted. You had your June invoice. So they should have turned off your database, right? I'm not sure. I mean, I paid... You were going to shut... So you paid June, but not July. I mean, my contract ended... I paid to end it early. My contract ended August 7th, and I paid to end it early. But I paid through August. I just paid, like, I think it's... Okay, that's a one. Yeah, I see it. But I just paid a little bit of a, you know... Okay, yeah. So the problem, I think, is that we did not... Hold on one second. Why is this still on? Get a return request. Okay, that's been paid. I'm just looking in here. Hold on one second. Because right now it's still on. And I think we might have missed a step as far as turning it off. Let me see this invoice. Yeah, that was 80%. Okay. For July. Okay. so that is why so I need to make sure this ticket okay So your contract was, so we did it for the early termination for July. So you don't need the database on now, right? No, no. Yeah, I just need to be able to access these resumes when I can afford to upload them to a new database, if ever. Okay. Yeah, so basically what you'd have to do is, so in those times you may not really be able to use it. Yeah. Because it's like the whole database structure. Yeah. Yeah, and I don't need, I don't need, I just need to be able to upload resumes. I don't need to upload, like, the structure and have them be formatted anyway. I just need to be able to upload resumes. So there would be two files that are in that download. Okay. So, where's the other one? So just the docs is the important one if I just want the resumes? Yeah. Okay. The other one's going to be, like, all your tables and all that stuff. So just download the docs? Yeah. Okay. And so the docs won't be needed to be downloaded in SQL, Microsoft SQL Server? Yeah, I haven't actually gotten into those, so I don't know if you go in there, is it actual files in there? Okay. Are you able to open that other file? I canceled the other one, and I'm now just downloading the docs. As long as I just have the resumes, that's all I need. Because I – yeah, I just need the resumes. That's all. So now I'm downloading the docs. So it says it's going to take some minutes. So I guess when it downloads, I'll try opening it up, I guess. I don't know what a RAR file is, but if I can open that. That was going to be in the back file. It's going to be a folder called resumes. Okay. So each file includes a reference ID that matches the related record that was in your database. Okay. So like if you are a candidate in the database, you have an ID number that's like your record, and then that file should have referenced that ID number. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I never really took that many notes in PCR. Like, I use LinkedIn Recruiter instead. So I kind of just use PCR to upload resumes anyway. So I just need the resumes. Okay. All right. I'm going to go ahead and... And I'll ask my IT guy to help me too that I have, but I j...
