## 💬 Full Transcript

 Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Hello, Deborah. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call just following up with you to touch base. We talked in the past about your possible interest in exploring the cloud-based version of PC Recruiter to replace the current self-hosted version you have. And I've been having some conversations with some people at your organization, and there's been some, I don't know, some issues or something going on with it. So I thought I'd follow up and just kind of touch base, see if that was of interest to you, if we could rekindle that discussion. I also have been in contact with David, so I'm going to give him a call as well. My direct is 440-856-0314. If you'd like to give me a call, let me know if you want to discuss that more, if you have any additional questions at all. once again Jim with PC recruiter 440-856-0314 thanks we'll talk to you soon bye...
