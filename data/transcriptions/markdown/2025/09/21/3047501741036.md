## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Wayne Miller. Good morning, or good afternoon. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Awesome. Awesome. Hey, I got a quick question for you. I am trying to figure out how to either A, get a link for a profile that I've created, or B, edit my registration page so that I can put language in there about, you know, opting in for text messages and all that. So I've done it on a profile, but I can't figure out how to get the actual URL link to put in my application or the registration. I can't figure out how to edit the registration form, which has the URL link. So I've got to go one way or the other. Yeah, let me pop in here. Does that make sense where I'm at? Yeah. Which database is this in? HVAC. So is this like a profile that you want to attach to like every position on the job board? No, not necessarily. The profile, when I send an email out to people, I send a link for the profile and I have a question in there, you know, for would you like to be, you know, opt in for text messaging or whatever. But I was thinking about was if I go to the web links, there was a registration form there. Let's see, Web Extension, VCR website links, then there was a registration URL. So click on that. You know, it has a place for a person to register on our site, and it has a place for a phone number. And I was thinking about if I could just somehow put in that, you know, phone number, I could add a little in parentheses there, you know, about opting in or whatever, or is that possible to do? Yeah, let me take a look here. because what you normally do is you said you send out an email with it yeah okay so that one you just need to edit the form letter yeah i've done that that was good but what i'm trying to do is the application i gotta send to the government because i'm changing phone carriers so i gotta i gotta register my company again for to be um compliant so i need a URL that they can look at to see that it's there. Whenever I attach to an email, that's one thing, but is there a place I can just get the URL for that profile? Not the profile itself, unless you sent it to yourself and opened it. Yeah. I actually tried to do that. My email is not going through. Yeah, I got you. Okay. Yeah, so with the job board configuration, there's, like, the register, like, tells you, like, what fields they're filling out. Let me see here. Just taking a look. Because normally what we would have to do is have our webmaster, Drew, go in and change those settings for you. Like he can change the language for the job board page. Right. But he is unfortunately on vacation this week. That's right. That's right. So let me try and send an email to myself again. Try while I go. It never went through. Let me just try again. Yeah, let me take a look at your settings here. All right, I got that time. Okay, so click here to upload your resume. All right, that has a link there. But the problem is that link is coming from that person's name, so the name and everything and it all is there. Is there a generic link that I could send to somebody where they would just register? Not with the PCR profiles because they're connected to the database. Okay. So how can I send the government a link that showed him that on a registration form I have the language there that, you know, SMS text message rates may apply? So what we would have to do, like I said, is we'd have to have Drew update that information on the job board page. What I can do is, let me see. Let me look. So if you go to system, okay, and then job board. I'm getting there. I think I've got too many tabs open. Let me close a few. Yeah, it's actually hung up now. Get a good old wait or end closed page. Go ahead and close the page and then just like, I am opening a new one. Okay, system, anywhere. Job board. Okay. And then job board messages. Okay. You'll see there, that's like that top of the page where it says don't see a job that interests you, click here to submit your resume. We'll keep it confidential. You could always add in some extra text there if you wanted about like all applications and, like all applications and submissions are opting into text messaging, whatever language you needed you could put in there so that it's at the top of that page on your website. right let's see okay I guess that's an option so that way you could then send them that link okay and then where do I get that link from so that would just be like on your actual job board site like on your actual website from the web extensions right is that from the web extensions one of those do to do it would be my links no so where's your well I haven't embedded I haven't embedded on my website yeah so it would just be your what's your website EHR partners calm I have my PCR web my job board in bed on her right for right now No, I don't. I took that off. That's right. Oh, so you're not using the PC Recruiter job board anymore? No...
