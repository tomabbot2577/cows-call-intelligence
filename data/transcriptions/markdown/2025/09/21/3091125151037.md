## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you, Todd. This is Tyler. How can I help you? I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. You were cutting in and out on me. Nope. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, I appreciate that. Yeah, I'm calling you from the Highland Consulting Group. We're a PCR user. I'm having trouble with my capture function. I can't seem to get it to work. I was hoping you might be able to help me troubleshoot that. Yeah, not a problem. Was it a particular site it was working on, or is it just not popping up for you? Yeah, I've got it coming up on my toolbar at the top, but when I go into a particular candidate from LinkedIn, it's not giving me the little slide-out extension function. yeah let's hop on a quick screen share so I can take a look here what's a good email address for you? sure it's jkane at mri mary robert indigo dash hcg helo charlie gecko dot com perfect alright I just sent that meeting link on over to you you should get it here in just a second yep no worries and it's thinking alright if you see it asking to connect to audio or video you can just exit out of that ok and then just hit like continue without audio and you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share and you'll want to share your entire screen. So you might see a couple options. Just if you have multiple screens, you'll just click on which entire screen you'll want to share and then hit share again in the pop-up box. All right. Perfect. All right. Let's go ahead and take a look at LinkedIn here. Well, unfortunately, I removed that over so I could see it. All right. Can you go ahead and refresh this page for me? Sure. How's that? There it goes. Did you just add the capture tool? I added it earlier this morning, but I haven't had it come up to this point. Yeah, so what will happen, so if you had that LinkedIn tab open before you got the Capture tool and logged into it, you have to refresh the tab once you add it and sign in. Otherwise, the tab doesn't know that the change took effect. Okay, I got you. Well, that was a very stupid and simple thing to fix. So one thing I noticed, though, go ahead and click that capture extension up at the top for me. You may want to turn basic mode off. What basic mode does is it just does a quick capture without you having the review options at all. Okay. So it won't tell you, like, if someone's already in the database or not. Gotcha. So if I have that off, then I'll be able to get – or I won't have any dupes is what I'm hearing. Yep. So just make sure when you go back to the LinkedIn page, you give it a quick refresh because we made that change in the capture tool. Okay, perfect. Awesome. Wow, Tyler, that's got to be your easiest phone call today, man, apart from somebody who hasn't had their computer plugged in. Hey, I'll take it. All right, brother. Very good. I appreciate the help. I'm more than happy to. Like I said, just give that page a refresh and you'll be good to go. Awesome. All right, man. Well, listen, have a good rest of your day, huh? You as well. Have a good one. All right. Bye-bye. Bye. Thank you....
