## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling the technology. Jason, happy to help you. Hey, how's it going? This is Omar. I have a quick question. I appreciate y'all's help. I have a client here who's trying to do like a mass import of contacts from an Excel sheet. I was wondering if you could help me through the process of that. They have an Excel sheet and they want to add it to like their database and make it into a roll-up. I don't know too much about that. Yeah. I think the easiest way to go about this is we have a video that walks through the importing process. I could email them that video and it goes step-by-step on everything that would need to happen. So I could send that over to them. Yeah. Awesome. Could you please CC me in that as well, please? Yeah, absolutely. Give me one second. What is the email of the person who's going to be doing it? It's going to be Logan, L-O-G-A-N, at The Monson Group, M-O-N-S-O-N Group.com. Logan at TheMonsonGroup.com. Yes. And what's your email that I can see you on? It's going to be Omar at NextLevelExchange.com. Okay, awesome. I'll get this important video sent over to them. And if they have any questions, you could have them call the support line and we could walk them through a little more detail. But the video covers it extensively. Awesome. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. Yeah, absolutely. Bye. Bye....
