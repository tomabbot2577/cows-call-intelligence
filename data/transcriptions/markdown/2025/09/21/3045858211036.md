## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. I'm trying to pull activity inside CCR. Let's get me checked in first. I'm with Connected Services. And last week, earlier this week, I don't really remember, I got some help doing that, and it was kind of complicated. But, you know, every day we have a little daily meeting, and I like to report my numbers and I like to report my numbers of PCU or recruiter you not PCU so I went back in to try and do that list again today and I've made it into the activity search parameters and I've made it in filter and I've typed the date the end date the records per page I've done activity types of outbound calls and I put my username in. I'm not quite sure what else to do from this point. So in the top right, there's a little magnifying glass and that's how you run the search. Okay. It says no activities found. Okay. So I did something wrong because I called. What's your username in the system? Connie under Connie pretty sure but let me double check on this yeah they just had me as Connie and you're searching for the outbound activity right I need to learn how to do that because I don't want to call you guys for something simple like this so in the activity type you can just type in all caps outbound in the text search where do I type it now? In the filters. There's the activity type section right next to the username. Okay. Just did that. And then I click the search thing, right? Yep. Okay. Now, I didn't make 145 calls today it's probably pulling from the whole list but I just wanted to pull for the today which is the 8 which it showed that it said 8 8 okay let me go to it see it's not separate in it separating it out by day adding it all together that's what it's doing I made it open to read a minute still saying 145 up there end result. So how do we get it to separate it per day? So you just have to do a search per day. Right, that's what I thought I was doing. So your search parameters, the start date and the end date would both need to be 8-8. It is. Start date 8-8-25, end date 8-8-25. And where it has records per page The records per page just shows how many it's displayed. So I filtered by your username and that outbound call activity. And I'm only receiving 55 results. So there's 55. Let me – so I have to get an activity type outbound, username, Connie. Okay. What might be messing it up is I – oh, okay. There's nothing in that box that's checked. exclude activity types, that's not checked at all. Okay. So it says username Connie. What you were doing before with the 145 is you didn't have your username put in there. Ah, okay. So let's hit the spyglass. 55. That's pretty good considering I didn't do any in the morning. I didn't do very much in the morning because I'm running my desk trying to get other things done. But that's pretty decent. Yep. Plus having phone calls and getting interrupted. That's pretty good. Yeah. So when you do that search, just make sure you filter by username and the activity type is just outbound. OK, I think I'm going to get the hang of it. I probably won't call back. Thank you very much. No problem. Have a good weekend. You too. Bye bye....
