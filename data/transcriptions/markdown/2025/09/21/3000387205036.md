## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. My name's Chad Steck. I'm calling from Pipeline Consulting. How are you today? I'm doing well. How are you? Excellent. Thank you. So I have a question for you. I've been with your group now, I think, for like 15 years using the online version. And we're actually going to make a change over to a different system. How do I go about doing like, you know, putting in a request for like a data migration of our data? How does that work? Sure. Okay. So do you want to close the PC recruiter account as well as take the data or are you going to like remain a PCR user after you take the data? We will not remain a user after we after we take the data. It's going to probably take at least four to six weeks to do a full migration over. After migration, we will not. So, yeah, so you just wanted to open up like a data return ticket and then a cancellation ticket. Yes. Both two different processes. The data return, I believe, comes with like a fee. Okay. Unless stated in your contract, I don't know. 15-year contract might have some old clauses in there that might be a little different. So that will depend on your contract. But the data... I haven't signed anything since 2011, probably. Yeah. Either way, we'll be sending you forms and stuff. I won't be, but the billing person will. Her name is Robin. Okay. Or maybe her new employee that she's training, Davisha, might reach out to you. But I could enter these tickets for you. you want to start the process of getting a data return and cancellation that will require like a conversation with the billing person, Robin, and or her partner, Davisha, and then some forms to fill out. And then that'll come back to me and I can actually do your data return and cancellation. So the data return is given in a .back file, which is just like a SQL database file. And then we have a separate folder full of all the resumes and attachments in the database as well that we'll send you. So you'll be just just for context of how you'll receive your data. It'll be a SQL database file or a dot B-A-K file. And then just a folder full of resumes and attachments that'll be like archived and you have to like unzip them with a password that I'll give to you. So that's how the data return comes. And then you can figure out like to your new system, like, you know, hey, go to them and say, we will have a SQL database file, also known as a .back file. And then you could figure out how they migrate data into their new system. That's up to them. I don't know how they do it. I don't know even where you're going. So you'd have to talk to them on that. But yeah, then the cancellation is easy. You just, I think there's maybe early cancellation fees, unless you're like a month to month person, you might have a contract for like a year or something. Okay. Well then, yeah, the billing person will reach out to you on that. I can create these tickets for you and get the ball rolling on them though. Is there anything else that you wanted to go over? No, I mean, I guess it's just, it's going to be a, we're going to continue to use PC recruiter up until our date of migration is complete. So I'm not looking to be like done today and get the data and never, never to be worked with again. And I'm also interested in leaving the door open to always come back. I'm just, you know, we're, our industry's evolving. And with the use of AI, we're just kind of, we're getting, you know, we've got way too many tools that we're having to use all at once. And, you know, we're talking to a company called Loxo, and that's who we're going to move over to for, you know, we've signed a year agreement with them to give that a try and see if we can cut down on our use of having to do PC recruiter and LinkedIn recruiter and zoom info and have all those separate payments and just do it all in one. So that's fair. Um, all right. Yeah, I can, uh, I can, I have found your name here. Chad stack S T E C. Can I confirm the email? I have Chad at pipeline consulting, LLC.com. dot com. Is that still good? That is, yes. Okay, great. Yeah, so then I'll just create tickets in the help desk system for us under your name, and one will be a data return request, and then the other will be a cancellation request, and you'll be hearing from either Robin or Davisha, and you just get back with them, and they'll send you forms to fill out and the like, and that'll get the ball rolling for you. All right, wonderful. all right awesome all right well all right to your day and uh holiday as well chad thank you thank you you you as well mckenzie i appreciate your time and i hope you have a great fourth as well thank you awesome all righty all right later take care bye...
