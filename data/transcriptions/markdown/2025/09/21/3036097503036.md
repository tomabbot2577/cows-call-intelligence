## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yeah, hi, Robin. This is Ken Burnett. We've spoken several times. How are you? I'm good. Listen, the reason I'm calling you is I've talked to a number of people at PCR, and you seem to be the most knowledgeable. Oh, I wouldn't say that, but go ahead. Thanks. Okay. Well, for so much better. Well, here's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to set up a sequence for a year for business development and what I'd like to do is set it up by quarter you know three months three months three months and to you know reach out to people hopefully I talk to them if I do or if I don't you know they then go into the next three months. And in between, I would send out emails and follow up stuff like that. And what I've gone through the, you know, the sequence to what you'd sent me a while ago on setting it up. Do you have any suggestions or how I should go about doing this? well here's my thing i don't like doing long-term stuff in the same sequence only because if you don't know what everything that you're about to do if you get something that hits or gets where they get into um a point where they would get queued up it's already ended there's no way to like kind of like restart that step do you know what i mean So it might almost be better that once they go through the steps, then 90 days later or whatever, they go into another sequence. To me, I think that's a little safer. Okay. Because you may not know what you want to do. You know, if you're doing like every, you know, three months or whatever, you may not know what you want to do six months, nine months. But if somebody already gets queued up for that step, then it can mess things up. Like if it's already, well, then they're going to complete it. It might just be better that for those three months they go through their steps and then at their last step or whatever it is, that maybe it adds them to another roll-up that you would, when you're ready, activate that for that roll-up. That might be a safer option. All right. Does that make sense at all? Well, it does. that's why I'm reaching out. I'm just trying to figure out the best way to do this. Yeah. Because I had somebody like they wanted to do like, well, I want to email them every month and they're trying to do like one sequence and like the person was just like picking the same form letter. I'm like, well, you can't do that. And then like if you don't get that letter in before somebody's queued up or at that step, like it's going to be a problem. Yeah, I do have another platform I use for emailing you know, mass emails. You know, I send out NPC emails and I have something else I use for that because that is mass. I mean, you can even just do it like you do, like a mail campaign, like you do it a sequence that wants the email sent or something like that. Well, what I would do is... And it just puts it into a roll-up list at the end. And then when they get to that other roll-up, when you're ready to start the next round, just use that roll-up for a new sequence. Yeah, okay, that might be. Yeah, as far as the emails to them, they're not going to be bulk. They're just going to be, you know, I called somebody today. I'll send them an email. And, you know, then I'll call somebody else, send them an email. And I would do the emails. So they're manual emails, not automatic. Well, that one might not be too bad then. Yeah, I'm going to do a manual. you know I'll have I'll put a step in there just to remind me to send an email but then I will you know manually I'll have a template made of the email I want to send and I'll just send it manually because I may talk to the person and if I talk to the person I don't necessarily want to send them an email saying hey I just left you a voice message yeah I mean in that case it might be a little bit safer you just got to remember before some like let's say you did four steps for now um and then you had it like once they do the last one it completes their sequence well if they get there before you put in that fifth step so yeah well as long as it's manual i think you'll be better off you should be fine yeah because some of the people you know let's just say january i start january i talk to some people well i've already talked to them and it may go somewhere, it may go somewhere else, the conversation. They may have the need, so I talk to them some more. Could you hold on a second? Sure. If I lose you, I'll call you back. Hello? Yes. Oh, okay. Hey, it worked. I lose people frequently. okay yeah so all right so the way if i understand so set up a sequence you know i'll call let's just say i talk to that person i can then hit connected and then that would send them to a roll-up which would be the next um quarter that i'll be be sending or they'll already be there but I may need to follow up with them or schedule something else and I could do that and do that separately out of the sequence. Yeah, or I mean because it's a manual email, it...
