## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yeah, Garrett, this is Greg Schmidt from Prosperity and Rogers Group. And I have a machine that we had the portal on for admin that we just had to switch out a machine, et cetera. And my IT person was trying to get the portal back to work. Oh, okay. We're just, we're, it's asked for a new serial number or something like that. And I wasn't sure what to tell them. Sure, I can help with that. Let me clear out here. Let's see. I'm going to look up for your company. Oh, yeah, it's listed as both companies here. Okay. Yeah. Probably need it for both, I think. Well, I mean, it depends. Do you need it for both for the portal for their machine? No. Yeah, it'll just be one serial number. It's listed as Rogers Group or here. Let me double check here. Prosperity. Oh, that is a different serial number for prosperity. OK. Do you know you prefer the prosperity number or the Rogers Group number? well I would say the prosperity one hang on let me just take a look here at what he's working on because we're trying to keep this as simple as possible so wait a second here so yeah prosperity and it's Does it matter what username it is? No, that's okay. No, that's fine. So the number is 208-798-746-158-339. Yeah, 339 is the last three digits there. All right, I'll read it back to you for a second. Sure. So I got a question because this is like an admin thing and sometimes – so for admin stuff, you have different people working on admin at different times. But they'll use that same computer because I don't have any full timers left. Gotcha. Yeah. So that won't change anything like for my portal or for my other admin portal at all. No, no. Yeah. So you have a total of eight seats, let's say, maybe a good way to put it with that code, that serial number. and that means eight devices can sign in with that serial number. If you do have, you try to put in a ninth, it'll say license expired. You know, just call us and what we can actually do is clear out a device. We have just like a date that shows the last time a device logged in. And if it says the last login was in 2023 or something, that would let us know, okay, that's a device people aren't using anymore. So let's clear that out. so that you can use one of those eight seats for a new device that people are using. You're using the number eight theoretically, because we've shrunk down quite a bit over the years as I'm getting older. So we definitely don't have eight. But we've still got more than one machine per person, you know, because you've got some people that have a portal. I've got like a laptop, et cetera. Oh, right. And I've started to have people work at home, just like you guys. So they'll have a machine here they can work on and a machine at home, that kind of thing. Yeah, and that's probably why they have eight included on your account. So the users can have multiple devices, laptop at home or something like that. So yeah, you're currently under Prosperity. Do you have the eight? Okay, got it. Well, there's not an extra charge for each one of those eight, is there? I don't believe so. Are you figuring out how much we really got in service? Yeah, if you were curious, we could connect you over with Brian Kane, your account rep, and he could look over the contract and see kind of how that plays into your monthly fee. But right now – Actually, I'm working with Brian on something right now. Oh, good. We're evaluating some things. But for this, I just want to do it quick and dirty and keep the machine working. Yeah, exactly. So I'll talk to Brian. So let me just read back the number again. 208-798-746-158-339. Exactly. Perfect. Awesome. Thanks so much, Garrett. Thank you. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. You got it. Yep. Thanks. Bye....
