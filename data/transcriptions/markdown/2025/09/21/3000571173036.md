## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Survival Systems. This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance. Survival Systems, how may I help you? Hi, this is Garrett. I'm trying to reach Jill. We're in a meeting for PCR. Oh, yes. Just one moment, please. Okay. Okay. Sorry about that. I thought Gabe had set my audio up, but apparently not. No problem. What should I do? I need to get here. All right. So just click the blue share button down at the bottom of the RingCentral meeting. Got it. And select your entire screen up at the top. Okay. You might have to click on like screen one or something to highlight it and then hit share. Okay, there you are. Perfect, I can see that. Alright, so let's jump into PCR and we'll take a look at some of the issues we've been having with the form letters. So do you want to see the error first or what it should look like? Yeah. I have letters that I haven't, the only two letters that I edited are the ones that aren't working. All the other letters are fine. So I can show you what it's supposed to look like. Okay, cool. Okay. I'll just hit record on the screen share here. Perfect. Okay, so I'm going to go to myself and then I'm going to come here and then I'm specific B letter here. okay so these two right here the sss ones are the ones that have the air this here is what it's supposed to look like and then i would enable and then i would fix that format obviously and then change whatever needs to be changed depending on the term for that client okay okay so that's what it's supposed to look like same the autofill right here gotcha okay and this is what it's doing when I edit the letter boom okay word on okay and if you hit yes what ends up happening there that error Okay, hit okay on that. And then you said this happened for brand new letters as well? It was a lot. These two letters right here, they've been in here forever and I've been using them on a weekly basis, but I had to add a paragraph in. So I went to my letters over here and I did here and then I would hit edit and I added the information which was something this paragraph right here and then I hit save and so I went to the next letter did the same thing and then I did like a test and that's when I I experienced the error, so I didn't edit the other four letters because I have to use them. Now I have to go to an old letter and change this and change that, which it shouldn't be that way. Right. All right. And then if you close this out and just edit one of the letters that are working without saving it, I just want to make sure that at the top left it still says Word. I'm going to use this one because that's so, let's see. That's a word. Okay. And that's one of the ones that would probably work. So, yeah, I wouldn't open it. We'll just kind of keep it. Okay. I was just checking this screen. So you could close that. And then go ahead and create a new letter. You said it happens with new letters as well. Yeah, we tried that too, but I can. Oh, I guess we deleted it. Okay. So let's add a new one. and you have to name it first right test see all these test tests right word or should I leave it as HTML for now because it doesn't work with the word right I wonder if let's go to eight yeah go to HTML and let's see if it's having to issue with that setting. Test, test. Okay, so I have to name it first is what it's saying, right? So test, test. Okay, yep. And then I would, let's see. No, it's not going to pull it up because it's a Word document, so I would have to, what, copy-paste maybe, and it looks like crap. Oh, I see. Okay. Headers aren't on there. All right. If you do the download button again at the top, and can you switch it to all files rather than just HTML when you're down at the bottom? Oh, you're right. My bad. Let me get this out of here real quick. Yeah. Okay, let's try that again. Where'd it go? Oh, there we are. Okay, so we're going to go back to the first one. It already exists. Oh. Why is it doing a save as? Okay. I don't get that. Is one of my letters named that maybe? I am not sure. We're trying to download it into PC. But it says C dot. Oh, yeah. I don't think it would be looking at the title of a form letter. Okay. I wonder. Yeah, if you just try to add it again, a new letter, and we'll. Okay. So cancel this. Yeah, that's fine. So I just want to make sure I was following the steps correctly. So you go to the plus sign, and then you're going to do the download button. You don't even have to name it yet. From there? Okay. And then we switched it to all files. Go down to one of the letters. This guy. Okay, it's still doing save as. Hit no on that. Let's make a duplicate of that file and see what the save as thing is about. So if you just want to copy it and like paste it in there again or on your, yeah, there we go. And then hit save on that and it doesn't matter if it makes changes. Go ahead and hit yes on that to the copy. There's nothing in there. It opens an empty file. Okay. Go ahead and close that out.
