## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Sylvia calling from National Payment Solutions. I'm not sure if you are able to transfer me to somebody in payroll or the owner. This is regarding child support to the state of Ohio and Main Sequence Technology. Let's see. Let me just transfer you over to my supervisor. One second. Thank you. It looks like he's currently on a call right now. Would it be all right if I just transferred to his voicemail? His name's Nick. He'll be able to get back to you as soon as he is off his current call. Gotcha. Thank you so much. Okay, awesome. So yeah, his name's Nick and I am transferring you now. Reach out if you need anything else. I will. Thank you so much for your help. Thanks. Bye....
