## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** You're expected.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** Hello, Javier.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** Yeah, how's this?

**[0:05] Speaker_01:** This is Jim with PC Recruiter.

**[0:07] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[0:09] Speaker_00:** Well, how are you doing, Jim?

**[0:10] Speaker_00:** Long time no talk.

**[0:11] Speaker_01:** I know, yeah.

**[0:12] Speaker_01:** I wanted to give a call.

**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I got your ticket here, and I saw you were communicating with my team, and I just wanted to kind of circle back and see if there was anything that you needed out of me or if you did have any questions on that sequencing or anything of that nature.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** No, I really, I just say I've been a bit frustrated with the whole thing because the reality is that we invested a lot of money and for some reason and, you know, I end up using a lot of tools that are not necessarily, I don't say PCR.

**[0:52] Speaker_01:** I saw that you were using Dripify, which actually our sequencing would do that.

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so the sequencing, at first I saw that we had a, what do you call it, the sequencing included, but apparently not.

**[1:12] Speaker_01:** Yeah, you're on a package.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** Let me look at your agreement here.

**[1:17] Speaker_01:** because you were on sort of a premium sort of package, but it might have been before the sequencing happened.

**[1:27] Speaker_01:** Let's see what you have here.

**[1:30] Speaker_00:** I don't know what I'm paying.

**[1:31] Speaker_00:** Right now I know that I'm not necessarily using the tool the way I want.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** I just see that I invested.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** I got it in the tool back again.

**[1:44] Speaker_00:** When I left Management Recruiters, I didn't have the tool.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** I was using Google and Driver, and then I started to scale up, and I ended up talking to Tino.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** Tino helped with establishing everything, and I had a person in operation who invested a lot of money, but not going anywhere.

**[2:05] Speaker_00:** Now I am using Dripify.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** I'm like, how do I use the sequencing that Tino told me how to use?

**[2:12] Speaker_00:** And now I need to pay extra.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** I'm like, oh, whatever.

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** I don't even know.

**[2:19] Speaker_01:** The good news is for that, the sequencing wouldn't be any extra monthly, so it would not increase your monthly at all.

**[2:24] Speaker_01:** And I could even do you a deal if you were ever interested in adding it.

**[2:28] Speaker_01:** Normally it's $250 one time to add it.

**[2:30] Speaker_01:** It adds it on.

**[2:31] Speaker_01:** It gets you a couple hours.

**[2:32] Speaker_00:** So I think I did pay that $250 because I do have sequencing.

**[2:40] Speaker_00:** I have access to sequencing.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** So once they told me that I don't have access to sequence, and the training was given to me by Kino, but then Kino, you know, every time there was a sequence, there were like four roll-ups.

**[2:54] Speaker_00:** And so I had the AI, my operation person do it.

**[2:59] Speaker_00:** And long story short, it doesn't seem to, you know, I'm not getting any traction.

**[3:06] Speaker_00:** you know when things things like this happen i i just i blame myself you know another day i have no one else to blame but that's where i am right now i i just have to let go one of my consultants because they were not uh invoicing and i'm paying her so it's me and another consultant which is in contingency i'll pay her tools for the mean and i i just wanted to understand the better use for for the sequencing and I'm afraid after when I wrote you then I found all the videos and so I'm I'm there watching the videos but they obviously when they say that there's another package I was like whatever so I don't know where we stand there yes if you have the sequencing you have the packet oh and it yeah I see back here enable sequencing that happened back in October of 2023 so it It looks like you do have the sequencing.

**[3:59] Speaker_01:** So you have that.

**[4:01] Speaker_01:** So there wouldn't be anything more that you need should you just wish to use the sequencing.

**[4:05] Speaker_01:** Just if you needed.

**[4:06] Speaker_00:** See, just an understanding.

**[4:08] Speaker_00:** For some reason, Tina told us to use the sequencing on a, we have like every time I open a sequence, it's four roll-ups.

**[4:15] Speaker_00:** And I'm like, that cannot be it, you know, because right now in Dripify, I use it super simple.

**[4:21] Speaker_00:** So I wanted to see how I can.

**[4:23] Speaker_00:** So just if I want training, just go into the videos and learn from it.

**[4:28] Speaker_01:** I was going to say, do you want me to throw a ticket in, have one of our team give you a call to answer some questions about the sequence thing, help you around it for a little bit?

**[4:38] Speaker_00:** The thing is that I don't even know what questions I need to ask.
