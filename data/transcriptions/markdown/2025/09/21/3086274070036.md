## 💬 Full Transcript

 All pro. This is Kelly. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a voicemail here. We were kind of playing phone tag a little bit. Do you still have time to go over some questions you had about PCR? Hey, yeah. I'm sorry to call you it on a Friday afternoon. No worries. OK. Where are you located? We're in Cleveland, Ohio, suburbs of Cleveland. Oh, OK. All right. So you're what, one hour behind? Yeah, currently, let's see, I'm at 4.44 p.m. That's where I am. Oh, okay. Oh, I thought you guys were an hour behind. Oh, no, yeah, we must be same time zone. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, that's great. So I know it's Friday and it's late, but I really just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Kelly. I'm the controller. I've been here for almost 10 months now. So I'm just under a year. And we're going through a lot of change here, which is all super, super positive. And I am welcoming myself into the year 2025. And I am going to get more involved in this PCR system that Jen's been using for 23 years. or something a long time. I don't know if it's been 23 years. So anyhow, yeah, so I just, you know, I have a lot of what I think are really simple questions. I don't think they're complex. I just don't know how to, like, get in touch with you guys. Do I do a ticket? Do I call you? Do I email you? You know? Yeah. You can, any of the above. So, yeah, the support line you called usually works. If we're not there, definitely leave a message so we know to give you a ring back. And then also emailing support at mainsequence.net with any questions. We can get back to you that way as well. Okay. Yeah. Has anybody, since you're kind of newer to diving into PCR, just want to, It sounds like you want to just know more about the system in general. Has anyone showed you our learning center? We have some videos and screenshots with step-by-step articles and things like that. Has anyone showed you how to get to that at all? So we did training. I think we did three trainings over the last year. We did it with Robin. I can't remember the other guy's name. Oh, okay. And I think they pointed that out, but I don't know if I – I think it was just too much information for me at the time. So that's probably – that's where – I can start there. So is there like a – or if you could just send me a link to the tutorials, I can play around with that this weekend. Sure, yeah, you can take a look there. So the best way to get there is if you're actually in PCR, do you have PCR pulled up right now? Sure do. Awesome. So at the top right by the profile picture circle is a little gear icon. If you click that, you'll see a drop-down menu and learning centers towards the bottom. Oh, okay. There it is, learning center. Okay, cool. Yeah, that'll get you there. And it looks like you're using the version of the software called PC Recruiter 9. So once you get to that learning center, you'd click on PC Recruiter 9 and look through those articles for whatever topics you need. You could also use the search bar. My favorite part, though, is in the main menu at the top of the learning center, all the way to the right, it says webinars. These are the pre-recorded videos, like their trainings in themselves, basically just recorded about each topic. So those ones I always like directing customers towards because it's sometimes easier to watch a video than read through a whole long article. Yeah, this is really good. I need an intern to do all this for me and then teach me how to do that. um so I'm gonna write that down because we do need an intern okay okay cool so I'm gonna do that thank you um can I just ask you a quick like short-term question oh yeah for sure okay so we have so I'm pretty familiar with PCR I've been using it like I said I'm the accountant so I do payroll and we've switched over from hard time sheets to electronic ones so I've I've really had my hand in it. But I don't want to get my hand too much in it because I'm also doing the payroll. You know what I mean? So I'm a little, you know, I don't know how much, anyhow, that's a separate conversation. But we've had, so we have payroll next week. And we've had some issues this week with an employee not being able to clock in. So she's called all week and I've taken down her hours and I've inputted them into the system and I think I've done everything on my end. But when they have a question about like the app or the software or anything like that, who's supposed to be answering those calls? Us? Usually, usually the, yeah, usually the contractor or the person that's, you know, trying to sign in would call you guys, the PCR users. and it's usually they need like a password reset or some of the time it does help to like uninstall the app itself and then you can send them a link to reinstall it. Usually are the best troubleshooting steps. But do you know how to? Yeah, we've been doing that. So I've done that. Jen's done that. And there's still an issue. Oh, okay. Gotcha. Let me check here. ...
