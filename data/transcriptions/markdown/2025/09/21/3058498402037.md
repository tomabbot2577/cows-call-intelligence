## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. Ed Peer just calling from CWP Technical. I have a quick question for you. I wonder how to make my setups for like my roll-ups and stuff global for everybody in my company, not just myself. So like the stages for the roll-ups? Just the whole look of it and not just the roll-ups, but the records and stuff like that. I want to make my settings. I'm changing some things on mine, but I want everybody to have the same settings. So I'm just wondering how to make those all universal. Yeah, so what you can do is copy your user settings. So once you make all your – yep, you'll go to System, Users, Copy User Settings. Uh-huh. And then you'll see where you see name, company, position records. That's where you can select. You can click into there and say name, company, and position, meaning you're copying those record layouts. And same with roll-up lists. You'll see where there's the roll-up list layout, roll-up stage setup. and that's how you would select all the ones that you want to copy over so if you were doing the roll-up list and the position records you would just click those five and you'll see that you're the source username up at the top already as the model user so you won't have to change that okay and for the main company position records record search layout main company position my IPCR, name company, record card, name company. There's a whole bunch more I have on there other than name company position. Yeah, so the record slash search layout, that's the main one. So if you're making the changes on that edit name company and position screen, like which fields are displayed in which groups, that's the record slash search layout that you're copying. Okay. Does it hurt me if I just click them all in there to make sure it's all copied over? yeah you can click them all but just be aware that if they do if you have other users that have set up like activity defaults or change their record card layout at all so like the little car like the most recently viewed record card uh it will overwrite their settings okay that's fine we're small so um uh okay so and then the activity defaults i don't know that we have that's if you put in special algorithms and stuff we've done none of that I don't think so so just put select all and then because I'm really just so you don't need to other you don't want to copy form letters that one will can mess stuff up on the back end. Okay. And you don't want to press all because there's the user record section as well that'll mess with people's security settings. Okay. And I don't need user records. Yeah. The only ones you really care about is name, company, position records, and roll-up lists. Yes. Okay. And then in roll-up lists, you won't want to copy over the automation plan actions either just because that can screw some stuff up as well if they're set up. Okay, so here's what I have checked. Under the user records, I have nothing. I did not select that. Yep. Oh, wait. Yeah, under user records, name, company, position records, name, company, position, and my PCR I've checked. Then under the record card, I have name, company, position. Those are all checked. Is that okay? Yep. And then below that roll-up list, I check roll-up list layout. and roll up stage setup. Yep, perfect. Click all the names that I want this to apply to. Yep, over on the right, and then you'll hit save. Save. All right. And is there any way that I can make somebody else an ad pen? One of my folks is very computer illiterate, so can I allow him? He can go in and do what I just did, right? if he finds something that he wants to apply to everybody, is he able to do that as well? Who's the user? Chris. Chris McConnell. So currently he cannot, but you can make him an admin if you wanted. So if you go to system users and then manage users you'll select Chris's name, where it says his username Chris, you'll click on that Chris. You'll see that security lock icon on the bottom left. I see. Oh, security lock. Okay, got it. Click that. Yep. And you'll, under the first heading there where it says system administrator, you can click into there to give him full permission to be an admin. Full permission. Okay. And then save? Yep. All right. Okay. I think that answers all of our questions. All right. Okay. Thank you very much. Yep. Not a problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. Okay. See you. Bye....
