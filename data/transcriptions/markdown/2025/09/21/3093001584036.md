## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hello, Garrett. I see you're on, but I see you're muted. And that's okay. Everyone needs to be muted sometimes. Hello, Bernadette. Do you hear me? Hello. How are you? I'm doing okay. How are you? I'm not too bad. Not too bad. I've got Garrett on the phone as well. yep so i first started using pc recruiter when i was with a um a search firm called global search group do you remember them i i've heard of them yeah yeah global search group they were based in south florida yeah excellent i'm just just looking them up there seeing if they're still using my batman hot because it's been a long time yeah i don't know if he's still in business he might have retired Mark Wench, it was a W-E-U-N-E-S-C-H or something. Jerry Wench, maybe Jerry. I'm just looking them up, seeing that name sounds familiar. I don't find them. But yeah, anyway. Anyway, so welcome back to PC Recruiter. Glad to have you back on board. and so what we wanted to do today is I know you're familiar you were a super user weren't you in the past yeah I was at some point so I'm very familiar with you know the roll-up concept and then you know also you know just adding things in there and then moving them around to like a requisition and having the open jobs and I what I really need to do is I need to customize the system, you know. And so I kind of went around and tooled around a little bit. And yesterday, I added a company, I added a, you know, I added some candidates, I added some activity, you know, just a handful of little things. But, you know, I, what I did was I, I outlined, I made a little outline for myself for fields that I want to, you know, kind of just change the name of them, maybe existing fields. And if they already had a drop down menu, just redefining that, and then also adding some fields. And I didn't see how to do that. So I don't know if I have the functionality in there to do that, I guess. Probably you do, most likely, I would imagine, because you're logged in as admin still. I did. And I saw some customizations where I could add certain fields, but I didn't see where I could add a field and then decide what kind of field is it going to be. Is it going to be an open field? Is it going to be a predefined field? Is it going to be a pull-down menu? I didn't see how to do that. Oh, it's like numbers. They're just like field type 1, 2, and then they're kind of explained in the drop-down in the custom field creation area. But we can take a look at that. I'm having a hard time hearing you. My headset's starting to go. I think I've been on it all day, so I think it's starting to get a little low battery there. But I'm actually going to turn you over to Garrett, because Garrett is going to be your trainer on PC Recruiter. He's an expert. and he is going to be the one who's going to kind of get you on the system, go over all the how-tos and all of that good stuff. And to start today, he has about, I'd say about a dozen, maybe 15 questions to ask you to kind of get an idea of your experience, your setup, what you're doing, what you're looking to do, stuff like that. At the conclusion of today, if you wish, he can get a call or two on the schedule for you to get some training hours set up. I'm going to be anyone, if you need to add usernames, have account-related questions, anything like that, come to me for that. Or if you don't know who to get, I can get you to the right person. But Garrett's going to be the primary person to go through your training and everything like that. So let me turn everything over to Garrett to go through those questions, and then he will go ahead and get something scheduled. So Garrett, I'll turn everything over to you. How's it going? Thanks, Jim. Nice to meet you, Bernadette. Hi, Nick. So a couple of questions we have here. what industry are you going to be recruiting in or working in? Yeah, so we're in the insurance industry. And what I'm going to tell you is that I'll just give you a background. It's probably going to answer a bunch of your questions, if that's okay with you, right? So we're in the insurance industry. We're a small regional broker. We only have 120 employees, and we only have a handful of types of positions that we hire for repetitively. Okay, so we hire for sales producers, but those sales producers could have, you know, certain specialties. So there could be under sales producers, there could be like, you know, four different kinds of sales people. And that's it. You know, and then we have account management, so we have sales and service. And then we have service positions. And the service positions are kind of almost categorized together. And we just really hire, you know, some of the titles might vary based on the amount of experience and the complexity of the accounts they do. But in general, we call ...
