## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, Robin. Hello, how are you? I say hell to the N-O. That's going to be a failed edition. What are the idiots? No. You can't just like, and I tell people, like when you're adding users, if you add users, delete them, let us know so we can adjust your billing. You know, him failing to notice that he was, we're not going to refund anything. He hasn't even played his June invoice. And he's like net 30. So that's like really for services he had in June that he still hasn't even paid for. So we're certainly not going to skip that one and July and give a refund. Absolutely not. He isn't. He's ridiculous. When is he talking about like that he even like didn't have another person? He says, oh, I've been overcharged for many months. Now, can you find out how many months I was overcharged for? And I said, it's on you to let us know. And you didn't let us know. I said, I see it was suggested in June, but you didn't let us know. We don't know if you don't have anyone using. Well, I think I'm due a refund, or at the very least, I shouldn't have to pay anymore. So when he canceled, he wants to not pay for July. I told him, I said, well, I said, maybe we can waive the July since we know you're canceling. But I said, but they don't do refunds. Well, I want you to have them figure out and let me know. I'm like, okay, but we don't do refunds. So that was that. No, his July. No, he could do an early cancellation for July. I'll send a nice little email right now because I'm really tired of getting people being idiots. Oh, here. Is Patsy home with you? No, she's out shopping. Oh, good for her. Only for groceries. Oh, listen to this. Oh, wait here. I got to. Here, I'm going to send you. so I get this thing about you know like you follow up like hey you have an open invoice okay I get this response no I think it was to oh I think it was to actually I'm going to send it to you in text on cell phone like people like fucking suck and I'm going to just start being a bitch I'm going to start being a bitch because people suck listen to this so somebody got a thing and they wrote back fuck you she died or whatever okay literally she died on this date so i replied back with uh you'll see it in here thing you got to see what i replied back with i'm sorry to hear about patricia's passing that said your response was uncalled for we were simply doing our job by following up on an unpaid invoice and had no way of knowing the circumstances. Yeah. Okay? A straightforward explanation would have been entirely sufficient. Considering I, he told me, fuck you, I think my thing is clear, like, uncalled for. Okay? I get a reply back this morning, fuck off, cunt. Jeez. Wow, there's some anger there. Wow. Now, this email is coming from the person that apparently died. yeah so did the person even die i don't know you're accessing her email yeah but this is what i got so you know what f everybody you have an invoice you're paying it and i'm just gonna be a bitch about it because we're not paying us what do i care anyway right yeah that's off and i you know you're as old as almost as old as me that is a i think the kids these days they use that more like freely like it's not like such a bad word in my day that was like the worst thing you could ever call a girl like oh yeah i never used that word i actually can't believe i even repeated it did i even did i even say it or did i spell it out oh no you said it oh okay i don't even normally say it okay like i uh i don't even normally say it i can't even believe i actually said it out loud to you but that's what i got today that's how i started my morning people can be so nasty for no reason like just let us know oh i'm you know like really sad my whoever patricia was relation to the person replying through patricia's email um like just say that passed away what could we do about it i would have been so nice about it oh i'm so sorry but But say that to me.

So I wanted to reply back like apparently I have a much happier life than you do. And I'm going to move on with it. Maybe you should go get some counseling. Yeah. That's uncalled for. Anchor directed it an innocent person. Yeah. I wrote it in a restaurant during my job and following up on an unpaid invoice and had no way of knowing the circumstances. So an explanation should have been entirely sufficient, you know. And then I get that back. Oh, like the first one was just an F you out of nowhere. No, you know, it was unreal.
