## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. Yeah, my name is Nick. I just wanted to see, I'm trying to run a report on how my team is doing with BULKS. Is there a way to do that from PCR? When you're saying, like, BULKS, you said B-U-L-K-S, BULKS? Yeah, like sending email. Okay, yeah. I guess there's a couple ways you can go about that, probably. It depends on how you want to see the data, but you could just run an activity search. Are you familiar with the activity search function? No. Where's the first place? I'm on the admin side right now for the team. Where's the best place to go for activity search? Sure. Give me a second. I'm going to pull up your account so I can see what you see, if you don't mind. so when I walk you through it, I'm actually not blind. You said your name was Nick. Can you let me know the company that you're calling with? Yes, Kraft or Kraft Services. Kraft Services. And would that be under reports? Like I said, there's multiple ways. There's probably a report that will give you... what you want or there's like ways to customize reports. So in the, like after some setup, you might go into reports, but we'll, we'll find out a little bit more about it. Let's try activity searches because those are actually built into the system. And all I need to know first is how do you normally, like, how are your people sending these bulk emails any particular way? Are they sending campaigns from like roll-up lists or are they all sending one? They're all sending one way, right? They're all sending the same type of way, right? Yep, roll-up list campaigns. Okay, so they're just like selecting names on a roll-up and using the letter feature and that brings you to the campaign screen and they send campaigns. Okay. So I think that will write bulk email activities, which you could. Well, do they require – are all of their usernames set up with, like, PCR mail or portal to track activity writing? I would hope – yeah, I would hope so. I don't know. Well, let's see. I'm going to – we'll walk through it together. So are you logged in – you're logged in as admin in the craft services database. Is that correct? Yes. Yes, correct. All right. So at the very top in the main toolbar where all the there's like actions you can click or different tabs of PCR, go to activities. Should be like two little chat bubbles. And then you can search for there's tabs under that. So there's name, company, position or interview. So you can search for, you know, name, activities, company, position or interview activities. I think it would be names you're trying to track people or people you're trying to okay yeah you're trying to see people sending bulk emails to names so you want to be in the name search which is what it's doing already so then you can filter by date like I would say maybe just like how about the month of June set the start date to June 1st and the end date is already June 30th and then And if you go lower than that, there's filters, expand filters. Under filters, there's the activity type box. You can type in bulk email, one word. I believe that's the activity type that gets written. And then you can run that search. Bulk email, one word. Bulk email is the activity type that is written, yes. and you can, I guess that gives you like one view into how many bulk email activities there are, but I guess that doesn't really help you with the username. The username is listed in the date time field, which is really odd. I'm wondering if you can change that view. What's weird is it looks like AJ is the only one that's sending bulks. I can't see anybody else's. Well, there's multiple pages of results. There's definitely, there's 324 pages of results. They each have 25 each and yeah, Chris is also sending them if you go, if you click through. So here's, here's just one way. I'm just showing you one way to see like, I guess I'm just showing you one way to see like, I guess one way to see like that bulk emails are going out. There's 8,000 bulk email activities. So your people are definitely emailing them. Maybe reports could be something that you will. Let's see. There is the email campaign reports. Let's see. And campaign overview. Yeah, campaign overview report. Let's see what that looks like here. And I just want to see the last week from the 23rd to 30th. Okay. So you select a campaign in the, I don't know, I'll just pick the first one. 23 to 30. I'm going to go into the top and there's PDF mode, export, or print mode. A couple different export options you can use. I'm just going to click PDF mode. It's not right. What's going on here? So when it says select a campaign, it's kind of interesting. It makes you select one. Actually getting like an error. Come on now. All right. That might have to be something I report to QA and dev. I'm getting like a string error on the campaign overview report, but I think the campaign results list is sending. Or is it printing? ...
