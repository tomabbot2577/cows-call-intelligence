## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi there. I'm having problems. I had this problem the other day as well where when I try to reply to someone, I just get a transparent window popping up. Oh, okay. And I forget how to clear my cache or something. I forget what I had to do to fix it. Yeah, I'll walk you through that. So, yeah, it's clearing cache. You're on the right track there. So just click on the three dots at the top right of your browser. Yep. Go down to more tools towards the bottom. Yep. And then developer tools. Developer. Okay. That'll open up a bunch of jargon and stuff on the right. Just kind of ignore all that. And then go to the right click on the refresh button up by your web address. It's the arrow in a loop. And then you should get empty cache and hard reload as an option there. Okay, yeah. So that'll kind of slowly reload your page and once that's fully loaded you can test that again and make sure it fixes the issue for you. Okay. Let me just see here. Yes, that worked. Excellent. Thank you so much. I just couldn't remember exactly how to do that, but thank you. I appreciate it. No problem. Reach out if you need anything else. Thank you. Take care. Bye....
