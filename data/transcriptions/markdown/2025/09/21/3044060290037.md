## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hi, Jim. Hey, how are you, Melanie? I'm good. How are you? I'm all right. I'm all right. Good to meet you. You as well. I appreciate you turning it around and jumping on a call so quick with me. No, no problem. No problem. So, yeah. So are you new to PC Recruiter? Yes. So I am both new to the company that I'm at now, RCI, as well as PC Recruiter. So I'll kind of give you a little background as to what I'm doing and what I'm trying to accomplish, and then I'll kind of let you walk me through, like, next steps. Sure. Essentially, I was brought in as the chief of staff to Nisha, who's the CEO at RCI. She really wants me to essentially evaluate the products that we're using, all of our processes, and make sure that we're set up for, you know, first off, using them to the best of their ability. Two, that they are the right tools. And then three, how do we scale with these tools? Are we set up and using them in a way that allows us to scale our business for growth, you know, expansion, depending on kind of what our next steps are. So I'm coming in here and my first big one that I'm looking at is PC Recruiter because it's such a heart of our business in terms of, you know, our staffing side, the business that we are in. We work with the state and local government in the New Jersey and New York area. And so making sure that we are tracking everything that we are doing, first of all, but making sure that the tool is – I'm already seeing some opportunities for are there ways that we could do X or Y to help save for our recruiting team, save them time, improve their process, make it more efficient. In the meantime, I'm looking at, you know, what does our user licenses look like? I think we have two. How do they, you know, what are we paying for them? And then how are they evaluated? Are there other user licenses that we could get that's, you know, is there a version of a light user that, you know, someone who wants to log in and look around but not, you know, necessarily make any changes? Is that, you know, an option? trainings and webinars. Tyler introduced me to the LMS, which I'm really excited about jumping into. Does it integrate with any other tools? So we're looking at, you know, are there AI resume formatting tools that we could adopt to help us cut down on how long it takes us to format resumes? Passport is a big tool that our sales team uses where they, you know, understand what roles that we're going after. Does it, you know, does it integrate with any of these other systems out there. So I know that was a lot. So feel free to like ask any clarifying questions. But right now, my goal is to understand how it's set up from a user admin perspective, the licensing for it. And then if there's opportunities for us to dig into some more training and webinars, you know, the main recruiter that uses it for our team, you know, She's like, it's been a while since I've done any trainings. So she's like, honestly, you know, it might not hurt for me to go back through and watch some of the trainings, too, if it's something that I'm going to spend time on, too. So that is kind of my goal. I hope that helps you kind of understand why I started reaching out this week. Oh, for sure. For sure. For sure, yeah. So right now it looks like you all are two users on PC Recruiter. You're on our premium package. So you've got just about everything. The only thing you don't have is the AI Suite, which is on a free trial. So it's actually in there anyway for the summer. So the AI Suite is the only thing you don't have as part of the package, but you're on premium. So that's very good. You do have the ability. Just to clarify, so we are on premium, but we don't have the AI Suite package. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's Premium Plus. That's the AI suite. So that doesn't have it. But you really do have it because it's in there for a trial this summer. They turned on a trial of it a couple of weeks ago for the rest of the summer. So it is in there. Any idea when that ends? Around Labor Day, so early September. So it'll be there and give that a try there. You are two users right now, and if you need it, you do have an admin user. So all PC Recruiter accounts have an admin user, which is in there free of charge. It's primarily to go in if you ever forget a password, if you need to change a user, you need to kind of do anything in the system. It's kind of like a backdoor just in case you happen to forget a password or something like that. it is their no charge and it's also something you can use if you have someone that would occasionally need to log in to just run a quick report or do a quick search or do a little data cleanup or something like that so you do have an admin username there i don't know if you're using it or not but that is something that's available ...
