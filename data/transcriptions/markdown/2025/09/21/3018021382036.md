## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling my team, Lynn. This is Robin. Oh, hi. Can you hear me okay? Yes, I can. Perfect. I had a question about PC Recruiter, if you've got a second. Okay. What can I help you with? Yeah, it's a question about the API. I'm just getting into the documentation. Is there a rate limit? I wasn't finding any kind of rate limiting stuff in this documentation. For related to... API access through tcrecruiter.com. Oh, through the API? I don't know. Like, I guess, whatever, where are you trying to build it to connect to? Well, we're just developing a custom integration on our side. And, you know, if I didn't know if we could hit it 10,000 times a minute or if there were any kind of rate limits that you guys had published or anything like that. It's 10,000 times a second. It makes a difference. I don't know. Let's see. Let me see if I can ask somebody. I haven't really gotten to it. Well, it's okay. I had actually a couple of other quick questions which maybe we could ask them all at the same time. The other question was, oh, yeah. So this is a pretty powerful API, right? Like you can delete things in the API, for example. And before I go screwing up the database, I wanted to be sure that we had backups in place. Like if something goes very wrong, do you guys have a backup where we can regress to a previous state of the database? No. What is your name and company? Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N. Okay. Company FloraSearch, F-L-O-R-A-S-E-A-R-C-H. Yeah, we do do backups, but it wouldn't really be real-time, so if something did go kind of wrong, your backup may not be until the day before. So a lot of times what people do is they'll just kind of request like a sandbox kind of database where they can play around in that to do some testing first. Okay. So you do have daily backups? Yeah. Yes. of our database. Yeah. And how many of those do you keep? Is it just a fresh one every day, or do you keep them on a rolling cycle? I'd have to look at the schedule. Hold on one second. Let's see. Thank you. Where do I have this saved? This is probably the more recent one. Let me see here. I'm trying to see if this document, it's like a whole big thing about it. I'm trying to see if it actually has the schedule in it. thank you okay well that part's out of date because we don't use three scale for it in now uh It's not specifying how often. Do you think that's another question we could ask along with that question about any kind of rate limits that we need to go into? Yeah, we probably have to escalate this to more like our server administrators. This is not something that like the general support, you know, typically is handling. I'm trying to see if there's anything in here. It's a 24-hour guard video monitoring. That's not what we're looking for. Let me see. Let me ask somebody else here. There might be one more question if you're going to ask somebody. Maybe you can include this one too. Hello? Hold on a second. Okay. Thank you. I don't want to delete a bunch of stuff from the database and wreck the company. Yeah, no, it's just some cron. Oh, and he doesn't... What I'll probably have to do is create a ticket because this will probably have to be escalated. So if you can, actually, probably what I ask for you to do is the questions that you have, if you email them to support at main sequence, that'll create a ticket. We can get that escalated but that way you're wording it exactly how you you know whatever you want to know then that third question too and then I just you know Shawn directly John is no longer with us okay so that's what yeah I probably would have first gone to Shawn but unfortunately he's accepted another opportunity got it um I guess the final question maybe you know the answer maybe not you know so I'm I I have intentionally not set myself as an administrator in the database. So, like, when I'm working in the web application, I don't want to, like, accidentally delete something or whatever, so I'm not an admin. But this API has a bunch of powerful stuff, like, again, deleting candidates and things. And I'm wondering if those permissions are all included by default, even though I'm not an admin. Well, your API is just going to be however you're writing and how it's integrating with whatever program. So it would be really just part of your statement if it's deleting something. So you just want to make sure, like what are you writing it to integrate with? Well, it's just a custom script, but it's scoped through my username and my password, and I am not an administrator. So I guess what I'm asking is, and maybe you don't know the answer, but I'm just confirming that the API permissions are scoped in the same way as the web app permissions because I don't want to suddenly have super user capabilities and think that I'm just operating between users and the API. Some people will just create what's called an API username that's really only used for those connections. Okay. But, I mean, again, it's the same question. And a...
