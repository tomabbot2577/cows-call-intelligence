## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Holiday Inn Express. I can help you. Hi, I have a question. We are coming down for the Ohio State University game, and I'm considering your hotel because I see that you offer a shuttle. Is that available, like, for games? Yeah, so we do have provided a shuttle for the games, but it is one-way. Okay. It's usually like $5 a person, and we only do drop-off. Okay. And then how far do you get us there, then, do you think, and how often do they run? So the shuttle runs, I think, like every 15 to 20 minutes. It just kind of depends on how the traffic is to get you as close as possible, I think. but they drop you off, I think, I'm not exactly sure what they call that area, but it's just outside the stadium, and you can just walk right in. Okay, so that might be worth it. Okay, because I was thinking, like, if I had to pay to park or... Yeah. Because the other one I was looking at is right near you is that Red Roof, near just shortly after, but I don't think they offer anything like that, because it is kind of a hike to get down there, right? Yeah, it's a mile away from our hotel, So it's a pretty decent walk. And then we have the breakfast and stuff like that here, too. So I don't think Red Roof Inn offers anything like that. No, I don't think they do. The other thing, the Stay Bridge, is that connected with you? Because I'm going to review it. They're saying sometimes you guys overbook, or they overbook, and they put them over with yours. Have you seen the other one by any chance? So the Staybridge is affiliated with IHG, and they kind of, like, they do send people here if they need to. Sometimes they have, like, different issues, like maybe AC is not working and they send them over here. That's as far as I know. I don't know about overbooking. Okay. But, yeah, they are an IHG hotel, and we try to help each other out in ways that we can. Yeah. So if you want like a full kitchen, I know they have full kitchens in their room. Yeah, I'm staying for one night. I don't need all that. Okay. So I'm thinking like yours might be the better option if you've got the shuttle at least to get us there. Yeah, they do offer a shuttle as well, I believe. The ISG does? No, no, the Staybridge. Oh, the Staybridge. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So could you do anything better for Raid for me by talking to you directly? I'm looking for September 13th. Member pricing and stuff like that. Let's see what we can do. What's the date again? September 13th? Yes. And it was for one night, correct? Yeah. And I just need a king-size bed. Okay. Let me see what we have. All right. I don't have any kings available for that night. Oh. I have standard two queen rooms and I have king suites. That's what I was just looking. It's the same price as, like, a... The King Suite? Yeah, right? Sorry. Our King Suite is $399 plus tax. So with tax, it's $471.99. Oh, that's not what is coming up here on the website. Maybe I should go to the website then. Yeah. Sometimes IHG offers, like, the better rates online because they're trying to get people to book directly through IHG, which is the same thing, really, if you call a hotel. but they just have like all these online promotions that we don't have access to, unfortunately. Oh, okay. Yeah. Maybe because I booked in early member rate? Probably could be that, too. Okay, because it's coming up 285. Is this what you're talking about? The, what is it called? The King Suite. Yes, King Suite additional living area sofa bed. Yes. So that's coming up. Okay. Yes. So I should just jump on this one then, right? You can, yes. Okay. All right, that's what I will do then. I will get this done now. Thank you so much. All right, no problem. All right, thanks. Bye. You're welcome. Bye-bye....
