## 📝 Summary

 thank you for calling me in sequence this is Robin oh what is going on my headset again sequence this is Robin hello can you hear me now yes I can hear you can you hear me yes I can hear you oh perfect mm-hmm all right so um Robin I'm just calling in because I'm having issues using my BC recruiter tool this is the first time that I'm going to use it I was supposed to use it last week however the issue is that even though it's already integrated to ring central app oh okay yeah so I have a chat on this and I reply but I don't think I heard back let me check it I think what's going on is that the wrong phone type is selected you have that all-in-one app I assume where you've got like the phone and texting and video all-in-one app um yes the ring central app to be specific okay in this is this Hannah or this not a lid okay oh this is Hannah okay so yeah I replied back to Donnellan with what I think is the issue and I actually have your database up so I think what's going on is when you first go in to set up the phone settings the user phone configuration drop-down cuts off so you don't see the whole thing like what's selected I'm going to switch it right now for you to the correct app because I think what's going on it's trying to look for an app that you don't have so I'm going to save that for you now and I was actually just creating a ticket to because the developers need a wide in that field.  Can you give it a try now that I've changed the selection for you? It was selected as RingCentral desktop phone which is their older app that it was just the phone on its own so I think that's the issue.  So I just reselected the correct app that it's supposed to be calling.

Can you give it a try now that I've changed the selection for you? It was selected as RingCentral desktop phone which is their older app that it was just the phone on its own so I think that's the issue. So I just reselected the correct app that it's supposed to be calling. Can you try it now? Okay sure. Do I need to log out of PCR or there's no need for me to do that? I don't think you need to. What you might want to do, though, is if you go to My PCR, and then you'll see your RingCentral status link. Click on it. Is it green or red right now? It's green, and it says connected. Okay. Click on that, and then it'll remove it, and then I'm going to have you, it'll turn red that it's not connected, and I'm going to have you reconnect. Okay, so there's a prompt here that says clicking okay will remove this access. So I'll just click on okay. Yeah, go ahead and do that. All right, I already did that. Okay, so now that it's red, click it again. I'm just going to have you re-authenticate. Only because I made a change, I just want to make sure. Okay. And I'm going to reply back to Donna. Yeah, so I just wanted to let you know what's happening here, so we can make sure that we're on the same page. So when I clicked on the red link, it routed me to my RingCentral app, so I just need to log in, I suppose. Correct. Right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, authorize. All right, perfect. Now it says connected again. Okay, yeah. So go to, do you have like a record that's safe to call? If not, I can give you like one of my phone numbers to call. I can try to call my, oh, go ahead. Let me see if you have me in your database. Okay, you have me in your database. Hold on one second here. I'm going to add my Ring Central Direct number to my cell phone field. Oh, okay. It wants job type. um hold on one second i'm good i gotta pick i guess something uh okay we'll pick that oh and it went source okay and we'll just make up something free for all Okay. All right. So if you go to name on the main toolbar, my name is Robin for the first name and last name is, you can probably just put an M-O-N-T and it should pull up Robin Montoni. Okay. Got it. Okay. And then I added my ring central direct number to the cell phone field. I'll try to call you now is it okay because I'm calling you using my RingCentral app right now do you want to hang up and we can and if I don't let me get your number hold on one second what is your number 718 587 9925 718 and I'm sorry what was the next one 718 587 9925. Got it. Okay. If I don't hear from you in two minutes, I'm going to call you back. All right. But this number should get you right directly to me. Okay. Got it. Alrighty. And then we'll go from there. Okay. Thanks. Sounds like a plan. Hang on. Okay....
