## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Yeah, Garrett, it's Annie again from Triumph Staffing. Okay, so about the AI tool, Warren wants to know, there's some kind of training for these people before we go into him telling them to use it. I mean, what am I supposed to do? So, yeah, we don't offer any training. it's just a free trial of the tool that all customers received and we do have a Learning Center article that gives you step-by-step kind of instructions on how to use each tool so I can email that to you hold on let me get Warren on the line with us I've told him this and he doesn't listen so maybe he'll listen to you okay cool Hey, Warren, I've got Garrett from PCR on the line with us. Hey, Garrett. How's it going? Hi, Garrett. We're trying to figure out what this AI tool is all about, the one that we get the free demo on. Can you explain it to me? Sure, yeah. Basically, there are four separate areas that AI is now involved on your database. One is an AI search that lives up in the quick search bar at the top right of PCR. There's a little toggle you can turn on that says AI. And once you do that, it gives you a full rundown, including examples of how to use the AI search. and then the other places are in the job description on a position record just click on the ai logo what's a what's a position record those are your job orders uh there's three record types in pcr name record i get that i get that garrett garrett it's called a job order record what's a position oh position you say job position yeah in pcr it's called a position record okay So a J-O record, what's on that now? There's in your job description area on that record, there's a button in the toolbar where you can click and it'll generate an AI job description. So that's one of the features. And then very similar to that, on a name record, under the summary tab, you can also click. Say it again? Name record? Yes, on a name record. There's a tab on that record called Summary. What's a name record? A person's record, an individual record, Warren. Okay, an individual person's record. Yes. Yes, and if you go to that Summary tab, there'll be a toolbar at the top with that same AI button to generate a candidate summary. Okay, that one. What is that for, just to send to a client or something? Yeah, the client might want a summary, like just a write-up with a couple bullet points about the candidate. And then the final one is with email. So when you're going to send an email or even create a form letter, there'll be an AI button in that toolbar. That one prompts you with a few questions saying, what tone do you want this email to be? Casual, informative, friendly. And then it'll ask you, what's the purpose of this email? Is it for finding new clients, you know, sending out job details to a potential candidate? And you just kind of answer those prompts and it'll generate an email for you to start. It's like a starting place. Right. Okay. So you got the quick search. Now go back to the quick search for a minute because your search is super clunky to work through. Does this help it out? So this will allow you to use common language and phrasing in your search, your quick search. So, yeah, turn on that toggle. So I could put in something like, let's see, list hiring authorities with last activity in 2024. And that it would give you that list. Yeah. And so, yeah, that guide, when you turn that on, gives you actually a good handful of examples as a starting place to try it out. So, yeah, feel free to experiment with that a little bit. Right. Okay, now how can we get trained on this? Is it available? So there's no training available. Our entire customer base was just given this trial. So we do have a Learning Center article that walks through each one of these features. I can email you that link, and you can feel free to forward it to anyone else. Yeah, that'd be fine. But no training, that seems really weird to me. I mean, how are we going to learn how to do it? I mean, salespeople don't have the patience to go to learning links. Yeah, it would be a huge undertaking for our tiny training team to schedule training for every single customer for this trial. So the article just has a few step-by-step instructions, and it basically goes over what I just told you on the phone here. That's kind of the long and short of it, what we've already talked about. Seems a little strange. You roll out a new tool, but you don't have enough people to train your members. I mean, I don't get it. They're kind of simple tools that don't really require training. They're just kind of a click of a button, and then the AI kind of does it for you for most of those. So that's why the article is probably sufficient for just the learning curve on the new tool there. Okay, send me the link, please. And then lastly, is this feature turned on for Triumph staffing? Yes. I remember yesterday turning it on for you guys specifically for your Triu...
