I am following up with you. Just touch base and return your voicemail from earlier in the week. I understood you added a user. Just wanted to make sure you had that in. It looks like they have already adjusted that to three users. You should notice the change on your next monthly invoice. But if there's anything more that you need, please give me a call. My direct is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Once again, Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. And anytime in the future you need to add a user, just send me an email direct, and then I can put in the ticket to get the billing adjusted. And if you need any assistance adding a user, you're welcome to do that on your own. but if you need assistance let me know thanks have a great day bye bye...
