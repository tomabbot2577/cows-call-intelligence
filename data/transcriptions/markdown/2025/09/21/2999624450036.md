## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is the voice mail of Steve Crane. Please leave your name and phone number, and I'll return your call as soon as possible. Thanks. Good afternoon, Steve. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. I had you down on my calendar. I think you're back from your trip and all your traveling. I wanted to give you a quick call and follow up, just kind of touch base, see if you had any additional questions about PC Recruiter or if you were perhaps getting ready to make a move and get set up. Give me a quick call and know how I can help, or if there's maybe a better time in the future, I should check back. I can be reached direct at 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. I am going to be in Monday through Wednesday of this week. We're off a couple days for the holiday, but that will be back on Monday. Give me a quick call. Let me know how I can help. Hope you're well. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye....
