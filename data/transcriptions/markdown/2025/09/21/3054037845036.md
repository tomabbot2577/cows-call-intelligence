## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling. You've reached Mike with Cornerstone Management Solutions. I'm not available to take your call at this moment. Please leave a detailed message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Hi, Mike. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. I was giving you a call back. I'm going to play a run on your job board site, see if there's anything I can figure out. Unfortunately, the person I'd love to go to for help on this, Drew Rothman, You probably worked with him when you originally did your job board setup. He's on vacation until Monday. So I'll see if there's something I can figure out today. Otherwise, I will ask you about this first thing Monday morning. Thank you. Oh, you can give me a call back. My number is 440-946-5214, extension 5466. Thanks....
