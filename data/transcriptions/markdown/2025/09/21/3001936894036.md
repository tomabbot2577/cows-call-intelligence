Oh, I thought I indicated in my email maybe you didn't get it. So I'm having problems with PCR capture. I don't know if there's I'm having problems with Java or if there's an updated version or or what's going on but it's very very random when I when I can get it like I'm going to people on LinkedIn and okay especially like what happens is I'll connect with somebody and they're new and usually I go click on their name and I do PCR capture and put them in the system and they're not it's not pulling up the pcr capture it's not pulling up that option okay let's do a screen share what yeah i mean yeah let's do a screen share see what's going on it could be that you have an old version you might have two versions it could be another extension interfering a couple things it could be so it's probably best to just see it all right so let's see here let's go to me do you have ring central by any chance i don't think i have it no just send me whatever All right. So, yes, I'll just do a Google beat then. Bear with me one. Oh, gosh, why do I have so many open here? Bear with me one second. Yeah. Here it is. Okay. It could be some of Java because I did, I mean, I've got some kind of error message. Please refer to the Java install did not complete. I don't know what's going on. I just, I don't know. that's usually yeah it's usually well if it's a PCR capture it's just the extension itself so it's either something with that extension or it's a conflict with another extension so I'm just going to take a peek I think like always one called loom I think there was sometimes a conflict sometimes like we have more that like different extensions they're kind of competing with each other trying to do something on the page so we'll figure it out okay so I just sent you a link to join a meeting did you email it yeah okay join call I think there should be a link like join Google meet or something how's it worded join call it says it's meet join call yeah I'm gonna join call okay Do you want people to see and hear you in the meeting? Yes. Actually, you could say to join without the camera and not the microphone since we're already on the phone. And we're going to be watching your screen. We don't need your camera. Okay. Okay. I'm admitting you. All right. So you're in the meeting now. Oh, shoot. Now I've got you. Now I've got the. Oh, no. I turned my microphone off. I forgot to turn my microphone off. Okay. We're all set. Okay. So in the meeting, at the bottom, you're going to click share screen. It's the rectangle with the arrow. And then you're going to go over to entire screen. Once that window pops up, let me know when you're there. Yep. It popped up. Yep. Okay. You might see a preview if you have more than one monitor, but you're going to have to pick what screen to show under entire screen. Yep. And then click share. Get it. okay so let's just see something here first so um let's click on that black puzzle piece icon at the top right of your browser where you just passed it one to the left i don't it's called the manage it's called the extensions icon okay you've got hunter email finder okay let's go down to manage extensions okay and that's the right version so that's good okay let's click directly on the extension do we need to remove some of those is that no problem i don't know yet we're gonna we're gonna find out we're gonna do a process of elimination here let's click directly on the extension it's that green, blue, and purple right at the top right of your browser? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Basic mode is off. And then do you like to get the company or do you just want them all going to your default? I'm not sure. I've had it forever. No, I don't want them going to the default. I want it to look for the company. I don't want them just going to candidates. I want them to actually go into the company where they are. Okay.
