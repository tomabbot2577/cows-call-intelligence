## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I was curious if somebody could help me with a contract staffing question and setting up a contract staffing candidate with time cards through PCR. Yeah. Have you used the timesheets function before? No. I kind of need a reflector. Yeah, it does take quite a bit of setup. We usually do like an hour training to get you started with the time sheets. Okay. We need to set that up immediately and we should have at least three hours of training available. Let me check on your training hours. One second. Okay. There's one ticket that's been used up. Let me check a different one. Okay. So, yeah, it does look like we did a training about five months ago where one of the three hours were used. Okay. Yeah, we could do a, I guess, two hours on this. Yeah, it was like for sequencing, but we haven't really pushed that through yet. So we'll use an hour for setup for a contractor. Okay. So let's see. Take a look here. For my schedule coming up this week, I do have, let's see, Friday. Anything available this morning? I am looking at this morning. Let me check with the team. There are a few people. It looks like they're on calls right now. Let me actually just check with the team to see if anybody has anything sooner with timesheet training. If not, I do have Friday availability. What's the best email to get back to you at? rob at peskind search.com okay awesome i will check with the team and get back to you soon okay yeah if they're available anybody's available today before like one o'clock or two o'clock i can make it work i think we can get through it in under an hour potentially so um but you know If not, then we'll try and set it up for tomorrow at some time. Yeah, I'll just, yeah, I'll see what... We have a contractor that's going to potentially be starting on Monday with a client. So we need to get them onboarded through our system, all that kind of stuff. So just need to get that done as soon as possible. Sounds good. All right, I will check with the team and get back to you. Okay, thank you....
