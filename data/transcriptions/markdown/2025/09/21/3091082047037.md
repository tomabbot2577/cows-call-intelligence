## 💬 Full Transcript

 I'm having a bit of a problem here. Just working in the sales navigator and just going to do some updates of the profiles, make sure what we've got in there in the system. I do the capture, click update, do that, and then the little piece just seems to vibrate. It doesn't actually do anything. It doesn't transfer to the whole capture port. Righty. You said this is in LinkedIn Sales Navigator? Yeah. I'm just in a list, and you view the profile, and then right there, so it's got it on the list. The profile's on the right side, so it says click to update, and then click on that, and then the little piece just kind of vibrates in and out but doesn't actually do anything. You know how it normally brings up the candidate profile and then the company stuff? Yeah, it just doesn't go to that next step. Now, do you leave your computer on overnight by chance? I just did a restart. I do leave it on usually, though. Okay, let's hop on a quick screen share here so I can take a look at what's happening. What's a good email address for me to email the link to? Jason at Athenian group dot CA that's a th en I an gr oup dot CA All right. I just sent that meeting link on over to you. Yeah. So the guy just had a PCR with a big trivial pursuit fans. Is that where the little thing came from? I'm not sure. That's what it looks like. It always looked so familiar. I'm like, why does it look so much... join with though I've got you on the phone too much really it on with an annual thanks oh yeah okay there we go and then you'll see a blue box the bottom of the meeting window oh yep here so you can see just hope you might make some that yeah can you stop sharing on share the entire screen okay sure did I think okay All right, let's pop over to Sales Navigator. Could you go ahead and refresh this page for me? Yep. It's a lead list. Then you click on the name title. Hit it again, see what happens. Alright. Can you click the little puzzle piece up top in your browser? To the right. No, click exit out of this box. Oh, there's the little puzzle piece over to the right. Two icons over to the right. Oh, that one. Okay, sorry. Go to manage extensions. And then for the PCR capture, can you just turn it off and then back on for me? Then go back to the sales navigator page and then refresh the page. Can you go to a profile other than Debbie's? it does the same thing. Yeah. It's still flashing on the other one there. I'll refresh again. They changed their layout. Because I know this one. I know for certain that Julie's in the system. Is it possible to open the full profile page and not just like a sidebar of it sure let's see how that work oh something just happened can you click sure how that did it okay so it's working there but not when you're in the yeah it'll work on the full profile page you have to open each of them to do that so it's just like the list view because okay so let's see who gets confused yep yep okay yeah it's like the same as like the normal LinkedIn where yes okay on the profile page for it uh work properly nope already I will work through it then all right if you need anything else just let us know you bet thanks so much...
