## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just enter your name and password. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording. Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. It's James Barella. Hello, James. How are you? Good. How are you doing? Not too bad. Not too bad. Glad you could join me today. Oh, thanks for being flexible. Sorry I'm a little bit late. No worries. Yeah, I just submit one, but we have 30 minutes, so that should be no problem. Great. Well, yeah, so when I was at my previous firm, this was a few years back, we used PCR. So it's on my own now. And after like a few years of just collecting paper resumes and Excel spreadsheets, I was like, you know what, I wish I should have started PCR from the start because now I've got a lot of catch up to do. But anyway, that's kind of where I'm at now. Excellent. Excellent. Yeah. So the version you used before is still around, still available. and we actually now also have a little bit newer, different version called PCRM that is included as well. So you can kind of utilize certainly the old version that you've been used to, that you used those years ago. It's still modern, still used by actually more of our customer base, but you'll also have the new interface, which is a little bit different, a little more modern, also has a sales pipeline, a couple of different things as well. Is there any – oh, go ahead. I felt like with the old one, I was pretty good on it. And although it's been a few years, I still probably need to familiarize myself. I just don't know if I want to take on something very different. How different is it, I guess? quite a bit different and it is something that you don't need to use the new version you can certainly still use the version you were used to uh it's what i use and certainly nothing wrong with it it's modern it's updated it is it is okay it's a good option i just rather stick yeah my brother stick with the old one i think i usually include the uh the newer version just in case you ever decide you want to take a look at it or if a new feature comes and it's in there that way it's already set up for you, but you'd likely only initially use the current version, the PCR nine version, uh, the more stable, not, not the new ones, not stable, but you're used to it. So you're familiar with it. So yeah, I can certainly do something like that. Great. Um, is it just you, just one user? Just me. Um, my old firm, uh, paid for, well, I was just a, I was basically like a 10 99 with them. So I had access to it. So, um, Yeah, it would just be me for now. Okay. Well, our users are $115 per user per month with a one-year commitment. If you go a two-year commitment, it's $105 per user per month. Or if you want to go month-to-month, that's $125 per user per month. So you can kind of choose how long you want to commit. Go to either one of those. And then there's a one-time setup. The setup is $750, and that's going to be what would include creating the new database. that would also include the 10 hours of training on the system that's good for six months if you needed it and it's also going to um on that training they could assist you in parsing in a spreadsheet so if you have data in spreadsheets right now the trainer would be able to walk you through and guide you through parsing that information in to get it all into your system even if you had resumes you could use a resume inhaler to inhale a bunch of paper resumes. If you can scan those in and get them electronic, the resume inhaler will allow you to import them right in, in bulk if needed. Oh, so you could just like on your printer, just scan them and just let it, let it feed it? Yeah. However you, if you can get them scanned in, just scan them into a, like a word folder. And once it's in there, you just point the inhaler at that. Oh, okay. That's, that's pretty cool. Cause I, that's kind of one thing I was dreading was like scanning them all in but I have like I've got a bunch of different folders with resumes already in there so that would be okay that'd be great that's an easier way of doing that and if you have them in word folders or even in folders in your Outlook the resume inhaler is something that can parse from those it'll import them all at once you're not running a Mac are you no okay good because the inhaler doesn't run on a Mac just because what it's designed in doesn't run on a Mac but yeah any any PC you can point it at an Outlook folder or a word folder and just tell it go it'll pull them all in kind of parse them in one right after that just kind of does it in the background as you just wait and then it'll create a record for each one index each resume it's essentially a bulk parse that's going to give you the ability to just point and click and they're all going to be brought in and then spreadsheet data like I said that can be imported as well so that's going t...
