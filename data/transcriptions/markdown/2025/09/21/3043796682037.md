## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSignal Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Dave O'Connor with Hala Consulting. How are you doing today? Good. Hey, we had spoken yesterday, and you flipped us over to the new server, I believe, so that the AI technology would work. Okay? And when I'm doing saved searches, I'm getting errors that I've never seen before. Would it affect that? The save searches meaning so you open up like a advanced search? Correct. And you're trying to open up a previously saved one or you're trying to save a new one? Open a previously saved. Okay. Let me check on that. I'm just going to open up your database here. I'm getting in here that sounds like it's an authorization thing. Let's see. Oh, wait, I've got to sign in. What's your username in PCR? D-O-C-O-N-N-O-R. All right. Okay, and what is when you tried opening the name of one of those searches? Let's see. Go back in this. All right. What I'm trying says, if you look at all my, it's on the fourth page. It says PM-mechanical 42925. Okay, so I pulled that up. And then if I hit search, let me see what kind of error it brings back. Okay, let's see the error. Okay, let me go back and let me take a look at what's all inside the search. Okay, so we got title. Looks like titles. Okay. Radius. Not titles. Because I've been stripping it back. I've just been deleting lines. Where's the problem? Yeah, none of that looks like it would create an issue. Let's see. There's an end group before it switches to the ends. That's good. Let me try this. I'm going to try moving this. I'm still getting the same error. Okay, yeah. Let me take a look at this. I'll research it a little bit more, see if there's somebody on our team who's a little bit better with the searching queries and see if they notice anything in the actual query that's generated itself. Let me open up a ticket and get back to you via email. Okay. doconnor at mri-hcg.com? Correct. Okay, awesome. I will research this a little bit more and get back to you. Beautiful. Appreciate it. Thanks. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye....
