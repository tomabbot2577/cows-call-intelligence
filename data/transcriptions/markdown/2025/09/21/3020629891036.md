## 💬 Full Transcript

 Chris Rain, CFC. How may I help you? Hi Chris, this is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Yes ma'am. The person has just been sending you a bunch of emails. I saw a flood of things. Yeah, Yeah, that's all me. Apparently we had the wrong email for billing. We had searchaf.com instead of CF. So I fixed that. And I think what I want to do is send you, especially because of this situation. Where is the link? Here it is. Here, I'm going to do it this way. there's probably another one from me yeah these are all from you but that's okay as long as we're getting this thing handled the right way yeah and I don't know if it's her email like she might have her display name as Cindy Duffy even though the signature said Danielle I don't know that kind of threw me off there so I'm like wait a minute Cindy Duffy hadn't been with us for six years yeah the email came in with her Cindy Duffy has like the display name. I'm going to see how she's sending the email. She might need to update that. That's what threw me off there. And I said Cindy, but then look at the signature. I'm like, shoot, I just said Cindy. The signature says Danielle. That's weird because when it comes from, because she's the admin. So the ACCT should look like Billy Raines and the admin should look like Danielle McDonough and the ACCT emails actually have Billy Raines in the signature so I don't I don't know what I don't know why it's showing that on your end yeah we when they circle it in-house they read correctly maybe it were they starting it from I'm sorry are they starting it from although let me look at another ticket here let me see it's got like a display name by it based send email I see somebody's emailed back and forth within a ticket I think it has to do possibly with their email program I'm going to look in the fresh desk which is our um help system so you make sure it's right there but i wonder if it's like where they're sending from anyway so here's what i want to do for you guys though um with a new billing system there is a customer portal so okay so here i'm going to ask you to do something for me sure because i don't i don't deal with billing i don't okay and i don't do it You want to transfer me over to her? Well, she's clockwork, okay? And so 12 to 1, she's at lunch every day. The door's not going to hit her on the way out, but I don't have to worry about her being late, okay? At 1 p.m. Okay, because you're in Texas still, right? Right. Yes, ma'am. Gotcha. At 1 p.m., she will be here. If you call, she'll help you. Whatever you need to do, she'll get everything squared away, and she's really better for it. I'm going to spend the next 40, 49 minutes looking for it till she gets back anyways. So, okay. I have a question. Are you, you are David, you are David's son, right? I am. Yes. You sound like him. Well, luckily I look better. I always liked him. I think I've talked to you before. I used to work for MRI in their corporate office. so when he started his franchise many many years ago you know they came into cleveland they did like the eight uh three weeks of training um it was my boss that was training them and i was the one like getting everything together and stuff he was a fabulous person really nice guy but you actually do sound like him a lot like your voice our laugh and our voice are very similar but from a personality perspective and a perspective perspective if that makes any sense we're quite different so uh voice is similar good good good good i get called david all the time it's you know and it's always joke about being called worst and typically add with that day you know bless his heart yeah missing like crazy so yeah i bet he's i mean he was always just a fabulous person to me super nice guy yeah so all right um so at one o'clock your time which would be two o'clock my time i'm just going to put a little reminder on my calendar today's been a little crazy just back and forth juggling different things like i'll be like okay now i'm good and all of a sudden like five things coming at once so um i'm going to put a reminder okay well right at one o'clock she'll be here till five uh we're not cutting out early today so okay all right so once you get through the door say ignore some of those invoices Robin's just or emails Robin's just going to call you is there a better number to to reach her because I know the direct number just call the direct one yeah just call the direct number anytime outside of 12 to 1 it goes directly to her it's forwarded directly to me while she's at lunch. So that's the only time you give me. All right. Sounds good. I will give her a call back after 1 o'clock your time. Sounds like a plan. Thank you, Robin. Perfect. You are welcome. Thank you. Bye now. Bye....
