 Our call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. 9-7-3-3-4-9-4-2-8-6 is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hey, Anthony, Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. Wanted to give you a quick call, just circling back with you, to see how PC Recruiter is working out for you. Also wanted to see how everything was going with your training on our end here at PC Recruiter. I got notification your training ticket hadn't had any activity in 30 days, so I just wanted to follow up, make sure everything was well, and see if there's anything more that you needed. If there's anything we could do or you have further questions or needs, please give me a call at 440-856-0314. It's 440-856-0314. Thanks. Bye-bye....
