## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, my name is Stephanie. I am trying to inhale some resumes. I am not able to get them to go into the correct folder, though, so I'm not sure. I think it needs to be remapped. So like in your resume inhaler you can't add them to the correct folder? Yeah so it goes all of them went into the bad folder. I have resumes to inhale and underneath that it's bad and duplicate and imported and they all went into bad and I got an error basically saying that the mail item could not open file. So do you have it connected to like an Outlook folder? Yeah. Are you using the installed version of Outlook or the new Outlook? I don't know how to know that. I'm not sure how to figure that out. I don't know. All right, let's hop on a quick screen share so I can take a look here. What's a good email address for you? dot narleski so s-t-e-p-h-a-n-i-e period and as in nancy a-r-l-e-s-k-y at g um at concentric c-o-m as in mary c-e-n as in nancy yep yes so then yes concentric so TRIC.com Stephanie dotner let's be concentric calm all right I just sent that link on over to you you should get it here in just a second Thank you. And then if you see it asking to connect with audio or video, you can just exit out of that since we're already on the phone here. And then you'll see a blue box at the bottom of the meeting window that says share. And you'll want to share your entire screen. Okay. And then you'll just click on which screen you want to share. Alrighty, so this is where the originals are supposed to be. I'm not sure if I need to browse and see where it's being mapped to. All right, let me take, let me just expand this here. Can we take a look at the resumes that are in that folder? Can you open up one of those PDFs for me? Thank you. No, not wanting to open. I wonder if that's why they're going into BAT. Can you try a different one for me? Thank you. So that one opened. Does it let you highlight the text in that resume? Like if I want to edit it? Yeah, without hitting that enable editing. Would it let you have that text? Because it opens them in a protected view. Okay, let's try that again with a different one. What's the dialogue box? Is that? I'm not sure. Oh, I think it's that thing that's working in the background there. I don't know what the dialog box is. Go ahead and hit okay again there. Okay, so highlighting without enabling like that. I think this is still that old one. Oh, there it goes. I haven't enabled the editing for this one. Okay, perfect. It lets you highlight it. The screen was just on a little bit of a delay there. So that's good. Go ahead and exit out of this, Doc. Let's go back to the inhaler. My boss was saying I need to remap it. I need to find resumes to inhale in the browse section. and maybe that's why. Okay. Yeah, we can try remapping it there. So go ahead and open up the... The browse button? The down... Email? Below. Yep. none of these because these are all my archives or an old this is um someone else's email that I took over so it's none of these folders let's let it scan in there. Yeah that would be my email. Yep so go ahead and click that little plus. Oh it's still scanning there. Thank you. and then click the little plus next to inbox let's go find that well oh it just self deleted Thank you. All right, go ahead and click that little plus next to your name again. Then plus next to inbox. we'll just wait for resumes to inhale to pop up in that list Then which do you just put them in that first resumes to inhale? Yeah, right here. Okay, so click the big one. Yep. Then hit okay. And then let's move all those bad ones, like in your email. Uh-huh. Move them all back to... Do you know how to do that? There's not like a select all option, is there? Let me pull up my outlook real quick. I wonder if I do control and then click. I could just do some just for, you know, just to test, just a couple. let's go back into the inhaler real quick after you move those okay click into the activity log activity log down at the bottom where you're seeing all those errors and just like how do clear all right man yep go to the actions then import from email now okay that's still doing the same thing where it can't read those resumes go to about for me for a second about yep yep that's good go ahead and just click the X with the egg and then we go to actions and connection settings hit test let me just check one thing on my end Did monitoring – it should be on, right? Yep. Okay. um go ahead and exit out of that box right there go to actions again for me go to preferences And for the minimum size, let's move that down to 200. And then let's just add another zero to the maximum text size. Then hit OK. Let's move just like two or three from the bad again. And then click into those errors and clear out the error log again. then yep go ahead and still not like it up it's so weird because I've been using PCR for three years and all of a sudde...
