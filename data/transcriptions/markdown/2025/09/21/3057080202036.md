## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Kirk. Hello, Kirk. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter, returning your voicemail. I'm sorry, who is this again? This is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter, returning your voicemail. Hey, Jim. How are you today, Jim? I'm not too bad. Not too bad. I was the one you talked with before and received a voicemail yesterday, so I thought I'd call back. I didn't have a direct number for you, so I guess I wasn't sure where to go, so I just left a message. that could come to me too so it worked out well so Jim I think what I want to do is I want to get me and my partner to get a demonstration of PCR okay and not only a demonstration but also I need to know what kind of support you guys provide you know because there's a learning curve on everything. And I'm looking for, my number one thing is I need to be able to do mass emails. That's very important. So whatever version you have, that's the one I would be looking at. Okay, we certainly do that. That's our premium package. And we have mass email capabilities. You can track opens, replies on subscribes, all that. We even have a sequencing piece, which takes it one step further, and you can set up basically a whole sequence. so that if they open it, then they get a different email, or if they don't open it in two days, they might get a different email or something like that. Okay, posted. Yeah, we certainly do that. Okay. So I guess my next question is, when can we do this? Well, I am very much open Thursday, or maybe a little bit this afternoon. I could do like a 1 o'clock today or Thursday, anything but 1 o'clock. Thursday. Okay. Why don't we do this? Let me see. I need to talk to her, see what she's got going on. I'm pretty good on Thursday. Let's do this. Let me, when I hang, this isn't your mobile, is it? No, let me give you my direct. Actually, that'll bring me direct. It is 440. 440. 856. 06. 0314, and that's direct to me. I can't read my own writing. Okay. So what I'll do is I'll text you my email, and then if you'll email me, we can get an email exchange started, and we can copy each other, and then you can send us an invite or whatever we need to do to where we can be on there to get a demonstration. As soon as I get it, I'll send over an email and we can get that coordinated for sure. Okay. Thanks, Jim. Very well. We'll talk to you soon....
