## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and start the recording. Hey, Jim. Hey, Greg. How are you? Good. How's it going? Not bad. Not bad. All right. All right. So I want to show you around a demo of PCRecruiter a little bit. I'm going to kind of give you a general walkthrough, take questions as we go. So if anything is of interest to you there. you wanted to specifically look at that you recall from when you used it in the past or just kind of a general walkthrough? No, just walk me through it. Like I said, yeah, my struggle with it all from the beginning was, well, it was a lot, but my database got filled up with a lot of crap. And, um, hang on one second here. And I'm never sure, you know, I don't think I ever really figured out how to use it right. And so, you know, maybe things have changed a little bit with it. Newer versions. I'm not sure I ever had the updated version. So just show me what you got. Let's talk about it some more. For sure. For sure. So I'll share my screen. let me know when you see it okay should be looking at my sign-in screen right now yep perfect perfect so let me go ahead and get myself logged in so I'm going to show you the PC recruiter 9 product right now this is kind of the bulk of what most people use we have a PCRM a CRM product called PCRM runs off the same database has a little bit different format almost all the same features and functions but I always like to start with this version too because this is a little more mature piece of software so I'm going to get logged on It's all cloud-based, so you're going to be able to log on from any internet connection, PC or Mac, that doesn't matter. And once you're in, it's going to look mostly like this. It is very configurable, and you're going to be able to set it up to really, you can redesign screens, turn buttons on, move buttons different places, a lot of functionality. You can configure a lot of the screens there. So mainly, menu at the top, that's going to be primary navigation. the middle is going to be for searching search results and lists the bottom is going to be for the records themselves so that's going to be generally how that would look and how that's going to work in your main menu bar you're going to have buttons for three of the primary pieces and you're going to have names companies positions so that's how you get to your three primary record types in pc recruiter names companies positions names of course going to be your candidates also your contacts companies companies you're marketing toward or companies that are your client companies and positions the jobs you're looking to fill. So that's kind of the basic three primary record types we work. Also up here you have things like a daily calendar. So you have a schedule up here that's going to let you schedule meetings, phone calls, follow-ups. It'll sync with Outlook and Google Calendar. You're also going to have roll-ups, which is a list creation tool. So you're going to be able to build lists within your database. You can build lists, call them whatever you'd like, add to them, take away from them. So a lot of flexibility in how your rollup lists are going to work. So very, very configurable there. A lot of reporting options we'll take a look at. But basically, a lot of your day is going to be spent working in the names, the companies, and the positions. So if I go into company here, it's going to hold on to the last 50 that I looked at. There's a quick search over here if I needed to search a company by name or city or state, keyword searching, Boolean searching is all in here too. But if I go into, let's say, Vandelay Industries, that last one I was looking at, I'm going to be able to see right here, here's all of the fields that I've chosen to show for this company record. Entirely configurable. If you want industry-specific things, you can add those fields. Very easy to do. And then there's kind of two subsets of data that are linked to the company record here, and those are going to be your jobs. So here's all the job openings I have at that specific client. If there's a little chain link next to it, that means there is a pipeline of people connected to that job. And then I also can see I have a grouping of names as well. So these are my contacts or employees that I work with there or people that I've placed. So these are going to be all the people that I know that I'm working with at that company. OK, so everything is kind of centered in those three record types. So working, you're going to work quite a lot in your positions. So if I go into positions, I could click in any one of these down in the bottom frame or I could go to the positions. positions. This is going to show me the last 50 positions I was looking at that I was working with in the database. I can click in any one of them. That'...
