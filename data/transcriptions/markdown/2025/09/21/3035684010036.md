## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Vince Brown. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing well. How's your summer? Not fun enough. Not fun? Oh. What could you be doing that would make it more fun? Getting to the beach more. I only got to go work so far. It's either I'm busy that weekend or, of course, it rains on the weekend. Right. Yeah. Well, there's been a lot of rain out east this year, hasn't there? Well, today it's raining. It's either that or it's like super monkey and hot. Yeah, I'm hearing that from everybody. Like during the week, it's like 90 and so humid, but then it'll rain on the weekend, or at least when I have time on the weekend. But now, so which beach do you get to? I go to like Mentor Headlands or Fairport Harbor. It's like eastern suburbs of Cleveland. Oh, got it. Okay. and so is that like it's on lake gary beach yeah i was gonna say yeah it's on the great lakes there okay gotcha um in cleveland yes we do have beaches i know well and i uh i guess i was hallucinating because for some reason i thought you guys were located in the columbus area i guess i'm just uh no we're more we're on like east side of cleveland now is that just you or is that that Main Seasons 2. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. That's so weird. Yes, we are. Not Columbus. I don't know how I could fuck that up because I was recruiting out of Progressive for years, and I was recruiting for Grange Insurance for years, and I very much know the difference between the new cities. So it's like, how do I know that? Progressive is like right around the corner from me. Oh, yeah. They're Goliath there. Yeah. They actually closed some of their buildings, though. like I live in like our school district called Mayfield but it's like Mayfield Highland Heights Mayfield Village and they had their big office in Mayfield Village and then they had another one that's Mayfield Village I guess it'd be Mayfield Heights but like basically they gave a lot to the schools because of those properties and they actually closed one of them down because they just have so many people working from home now right I know well shit in the height of COVID nationwide wide down there in Columbus for sure. They, they furloughed like eight. I, it was an astounding number, like 11,000 employees and they actually sold one of their biggest office buildings and just did a full remote, almost an almost full remote thing, which of course is changing a bit now, but yeah, it's just so amazing. Anyway, I didn't call to talk real estate, but get to the beach more. Who do you usually go with? Do you get kids out there with you? No, they don't want to hang out with me anymore. They're like 19 and 21. Right. I just go with a friend. Love it. Love it. Well, good luck with that. They go with their own friends. Right. Yeah, they don't want us to be seen with mom. Yeah, right? That's good. Well, I was calling here because unless I'm losing my mind, And when you do a presentation through PCR now, it lets you know if the person's profile has been viewed. And I thought that it actually automatically moved the pipeline forward. It can. It can, depending on how it's configured, to do it. So, I mean, are you getting the activity that is viewed? I get the notification that it's viewed, but it doesn't move it forward in the pipeline. Okay. Give me one second here. Let me get out of what I was in here. A recent example would be Charles Valinati. C-H-A-V-A-L. We'll get you there. Okay. Let's see. I have to search group. Okay. Got that. It depends. Like you could set it like, and it's only based on your primary template. Like, so like if you had the legacy or new pipeline, um, and you might have it set where only if it's in, was currently at a certain stage. So that could be an issue too. Um, what is your database is Vince Brown, not sandbox. I assume. What is your username? V Brown. And you sent it from the pipeline? 100% yeah and I am 99% convinced that it used to do it and I can't imagine that I would un-configure it to do that. I don't know. Okay so what is the job? Oh so just you can just put in COO for title. Is that the one at Northern Neck Insurance? Yes. Okay let me first see what pipeline template this has. Or actually hold on one second. There's so many options, different setup options anymore so it gets a little confusing. Okay so what does this job particularly have? Okay so customize, I'm going to customize your layout so I can tell which template it has. The pipeline template used for this job is named primary pipeline no assessment. Okay so let's see Now, it could be the pipeline template that you're using. You're using like a different one that has no assessment? Yeah, so I don't quite understand that because I really only ever have one. Once the new functionality came out, I've only really ever had one template that I use. Well, that's what I have too. I have one for split partners, and then I have the – but for clients, I only have one for ...
