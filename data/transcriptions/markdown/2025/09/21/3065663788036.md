## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Stephen Wagner. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? Hey, I'm good. I work for Neely Pierce. It's okay. He emailed me back the other day about a list I'm trying to import. And then Truett, I don't know if you know him, but he mentioned you by name, said that I should try to get a hold of you. So what was going on with it? You had a couple other questions, I remember. Yeah, so I have, I've never done this, but I have a Excel spreadsheet I'm trying to import and it's like 40,000 records. Oh, okay. I just want to make sure I get it right. I, that's a lot of records. We're going to test it, like we'll do like 50 or something to make sure it all maps right first and then do the rest of it. So one thing that you're going to want to be very careful of is, like, the predefined versus custom field. You can map anything to a predefined field. Like, the column can be called, like, current title, whatever it is, and you're actually picking that you're going to be mapping it to the name title. But whenever it comes to a custom field, you want to make sure it's the exact name of any custom field. So usually what you want to do is kind of look at your layout. Like, do you have the security to view layouts? Yeah, I have all the admin privileges. Yeah. So when you go into the layout, you'll see the field and it'll start with custom. So, for example, if it says custom, then it has to be the exact thing. Yeah. Yeah. So you don't put the word custom or whatever's after it. So if it's like you want to go to the LinkedIn field, you have to make sure it's social with a capital S underscore LinkedIn so that it goes into the existing custom field. Yeah, right. Like we have like actual title as a custom field. So I got all that. So my couple of questions I had were. So we have a custom field for specialty and on the name screen, it's like a drop down menu and you can choose like if they're, you know, orthopedic specialist or pediatric specialist or whatever. So when I'm on the list, so it's custom field specialties. So the, it'll say just specialty, but it'll obviously just be like hand therapy as their specialty. Will that map correctly and just click that box in PCR? So as long as the value is exactly the same as any pre-selections you have, then it's fine. Otherwise, what it'll do is you'll see it listed, but it won't match up to your table. Okay. It'll be on that record and you'll see it, but it won't, like we're not going to change data, if that makes sense. Yeah. So as long as like it says acute and then on the specialty field on the Excel spreadsheet, it says acute and it's spelled correctly and all that, it should map correctly. Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise, you'll just see it like as a selection, but it won't be. Like, let's say you just threw something in there like unknown. If that was not in your table, you'll see unknown on the record. But if you were ever like going into the record and pick it, you wouldn't be adding it to the list. So you pick going forward. Does that make sense? Yes. I see what you're saying. So it would have like another box on that record, but it wouldn't be like an option for everybody else. Correct. Yeah, if you went to another record, you wouldn't see it. Okay, that's good. And then my other question that's probably just was answered. So we have a, I'm pretty sure it's a custom, yeah, custom segmentation field for managers. And it's set up to where whenever we have that selected, that when we go to the company screen, if they are a manager, it pops up as a custom thing that we had you guys do. you know, designed for us to where it shows up on the actual company page if they're a manager at that company. And so but if I do segment, so it's custom segmentation. And as long as I have it spelled correctly, it should map that as well. Right. I believe so. Yeah. Because that's not a drop. It's a drop down option, but it's not a box to click. But I think it I don't let me take a look at the database. And I'm so sorry. What is your last name? Wagner, W-A-G-N-I-R. Oh, here it is. Okay. Oh, I was doing V-E-N. That's why. Sorry. Oh, okay. That's why I wasn't finding you. I'm like, I'm trying to find him here. Let me see something here. Okay. So this is a nearly pierced database. Yeah, I don't know what they did custom for you, so let me see. So if you go to a name record in the bottom left, it'll say. Hold on one. second. Okay, let me pull up a name. Okay, so you've got a field called segmentation. Okay. Yeah, so if you click that, it'll say hiring authority or manager. And when you Oh, that's status. Oh, sorry. Okay. It was the status and segmentation. Yeah. Now, also very important when you do statuses, you might see it. You'll see a full description, but we don't use that. Like H is hiring authority. C is candidate. M is manager. And the only one that's different is X is not available. Otherwise, that's the first letter. you'll...
