## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is Robin. Well, hey, Ms. Robin. It's Tom Zalany calling from Denver. How are you? I am well, thank you. How's your Monday morning looking? Oh, pretty good. It's Monday afternoon now. Yeah, not too bad. Well, excellent. I was wondering if you or someone else might be able to help me import a CSV file because I'm getting an error message. It says the source to destination field mapping dictionary is required. And I don't know what that means. Oh, I'd have to see that. I haven't heard of that before. Anything odd in your file name? No. Not that I know of. Okay. Can you send me the file real quick? Sure. Okay. It is going to be Robin, R-O-B-I-N, at mainsequence.net. I'm just going to look at... Actually, you know what? Don't even bother with that. Hold on. Trying to think. That error. What would that mean? I shouldn't send you a meeting. Meeting. Okay, I just sent you a meeting link. Okay. So when you click on it, you don't need to join with audio or use your camera. But we will share screen once you're in. Okay. Well, let's see, edit, password, copy, paste. So I'm going to have you, you can turn off camera, but hit share screen. And then when you, when the share screen option pops up, go over to the right where it says entire screen and then pick which screen to show. Okay, let's see. Oh, can you do entire screen? Looks like you didn't share entire screen. So if you do stop presenting, do share screen, then go over to the right and that pop-up where it says entire screen? Oh, gotcha. Otherwise, it only shows me like a portion. Let's do this one. OK. So show me one of the files. So it's a CSV. OK. No double spaces anywhere or anything like that, right? No, it's just that's what it says. And then... And it saved as a CSV comma delimit. Can you open the file up? Yeah, this is the error request that I got. The mapping dictionary is required to be sourced. Okay. And these are names? Yes. Okay. Let's go back to your database. Let's start the import over. All right. So we are importing a list. And we're doing names. Okay. And you pick your roll-up list. I actually do it right from the roll-up but now there are names in that list yes okay so I'm I'm trying to add more names to that list okay so file to import let's click on that so it's 1185 Chris Ruth contains headers. Do you want to fill in empty city-state? No. Okay. No double spaces. Okay, let's hit next. Go to the field mapping, like expand that. Okay, I just hit next. I didn't do any of the field mapping. Oh, that's probably why then. I probably didn't know where to put it. Okay. So first name, last name. I think that's everything. thing like they probably have like phone numbers or email anything like that you got to map all of that you got to tell where to go this is what it looks like so first thing last name city state title work yeah you're gonna have to map all that stuff okay okay well maybe that's what I was doing wrong let me just do that real quick. Oops, add candidate wizard, title. So those are the predefined PCR fields and then here what you're seeing is what's the column heading in your file. So you got to do title, current title to title. Okay. And go down to city and state you have that yep and then do you want them in a company record or just put them into your default we'll put them into the current title let me just look at this if you click in a drop down you see what's in your file. I think you had company name so it's just do you want a company record for that company? Well I think what ends up happening is when we we say add companies if they're already in the system then it'll make duplicates so I'll just say no. Well it just it well it depends if you map to pound company name if there's a record that's spelled exactly the same then it'll put it into that company if it doesn't find one then it creates one so if they are kind of off in the spelling that could create one right right um okay so i won't i will not do company okay what else is in the file because then they just go to your default company we've got the linkedin url uh that you cannot map to our field unless you change the name of it which means you're also going to have to redo this import because the profile url you You want that to be called social underscore LinkedIn. Okay. Capital S underscore and then capital L and then capital I. And then what you'll do is you'll map it to the custom field. And since there's already a custom field called social underscore LinkedIn, it'll put it into the existing field. Okay. I'm just going to leave that out because that sounds like it could be really complicated. No, no, just here. We'll just go out, minimize this. We'll just clean up your file first. All right. Just go ahead and close this out. Okay. And then open your file back up. Okay. So anything that has to go to a custom field, you have to make sure the column is named exactly the name of the custom field. So instead of profile URL, put social underscore. And then LinkedI...
