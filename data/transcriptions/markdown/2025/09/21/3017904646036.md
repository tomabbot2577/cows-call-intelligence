 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press... You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Steve, I'm going to fly. Okay. Ready. Hi, Jim. Hey, Laura, how are you? Hi, Slate. Good, how are you? I am well, I am well. Thanks for joining me today. Thanks for talking to me. For sure, for sure, yes. I wanted to talk with you a little bit about PC Recruiter, and I think we originally were going to look at the AI piece, maybe PCRM to look at the new format, the new interface. So kind of wanted to see just what led to us connecting and what issues you were having or what complaints or whatnot? It just seems like it's so old-fashioned. I mean, it's even called PC Recruiter, you know? I've been using this for 15 years. There have been very few changes. It's the clunkiest, hardest-to-use interface. I've seen, like, what some of the other competitors are doing, like Cruella, and it's so much easier, like, to process candidates it's so much easier to find candidates in your own database. And PC Recruiter is just like not keeping up with the times. Yeah. So we actually do have a new interface, which we can take a look at there. So I do want to show you that. And then also maybe the AI suite. Talk a little bit about that as well. Yeah. That was of interest to you. So what we did, we actually have a new interface called PCRM. And it is more of a CRM product, but it is going to have all the functionality, just about everything you have now within PC Recruiter. So let me show it to you, kind of see what you think, get a feel for kind of what it looks like. Okay. So I'm going to share my screen here. Okay. So this is the new PCRM. And when are these things launching? This is available now. So this actually, a little background on this. This is PCRM, and this was originally conceived several years ago, It was going to be a new interface and a replacement for the current version of PC Recruiter. And as they redesigned things, added things, carried some things over, and many of the, like the sequencing of the analytics, some of the newer screens look just the same. Hold on one second. Really quick. Hold on one second. All right. I mean that sorry about that okay no problem okay so so what they had done so this was going to be like I said a replacement for PCR 9 it was going to be a new redesign and what they did was they ended adding some significant CRM functionality that they ended up making it a separate product at the beginning of this year when it was released and it is a separate product. How come I don't have this? Well because it is something that's been advertised some we haven't put forth a huge news release or anything about it but it is something that you can move right over and it'll it basically runs alongside your existing database so there's no conversion instantly as soon the link is created you can access your existing database but in this interface. So see a lot of it is going to be some of the same terminology but an entirely different interface. So rather than top and bottom you have your menu down the side so I can look at names, companies, positions, roll-ups, schedule. So a lot of that is the same functionality, the same terminology but it's got a whole new interface. So for example I go to names I'm going to be able to look at my names screen a little bit easier to navigate if I click on a name record it slides in from the right side of the screen. You have a configurable workspace, and then all of your different tabs are up here, like keywords, resumes, activities, all that you normally have, but it's all here in this brand new interface. There's some additional things. You can have different resumes in these different tabs, so you can have more data. There's a nice easy way, if you're looking at details, if I want to get to my phone fields, I can just type in phone. It'll instantly find all my phone fields. So we've added some easier-to-use functionality, And even on the main screen, the list of the last 50 records you looked at, you can now edit in line. So you can edit fields right in line there. Or there's an actions column where you can contact or you can add some things like activities, notes, put them on a roll up, quickly add a new resume. You can do a lot of things right from this front screen here. Yeah, that's easier than what you have now. It's a lot easier to use. And it's even easier to configure. If I want to look at a record, I could go into this record. Excuse me. And if I wanted maybe the resume to show right between details and activities here, I could go to my drop down and I could just drag it right there. It's going to snap right up. So I can go through, I can easily edit and maybe I want to take and move the company. I want to delete that block of text or something. And I want to move the contact info up. You can kind of drag and drop the widgets around, add different t...
