## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi. I'm sorry. Did you say your name was Tyler? Yes. Okay. I can barely hear you, Tyler. Is that better? That is a little better. Thank you. So my name is Vern, V-E-R-N-E. My last name is Shawl, S-H-A-U-L-L. And I work for the Newell Group. And I had recently last week got a new computer and I had spoken with Robin and she set up my PCR and parsing resumes and all that. Since then, I have been getting a error message or an information message that says in my email, like it pops up. Okay, and it says server referenced www2pcrecruiter.net does not seem to exist. Now, is that like inside of your Outlook? Yes. All right, so that might be coming from the Outlook portal. Let's hop on a quick screen share here so I can take a look at that for you. Oops, it just went away. But yeah, what do you need other than that message again? Yeah, I'm going to send you just a meeting link here. Okay. All right, just sent that on over to you. You should get it here in just a second. Okay, that'll be in my email? Yep. and it didn't do it this time but a couple of times it is it's popped up with another pop-up that's something about a serial number and I know when she did it the first time that serial number she used was expired then she used a different one and it was working fine and then all of a sudden these pop up started coming yeah we'll take a look at your connection settings here just to make sure everything's all hunky-dory. All right. How's life in Cleveland today? Eh, not too bad. It's not too hot, which is nice, but still not quite fall weather. Yeah. Well, I got to tell you that I am a huge Bengals fan, so. We got you week one. Yep. I still have not seen anything come across. You tried doing the send and receive on your email? I'm doing it now. Maybe check to make sure it didn't go into spam. I did not do that. I'm not in spam. You have the email as vshall at the noelgroup.com? Yep. yep still not a Yeah, let me try forwarding it to you again. I just sent it again. All right. um Are you getting other emails in? Yeah, I had been all day. It seems both of them sent. Here, let's try this. Alright. Do you use RingCentral? I do. Okay. In RingCentral, go to the video tab. Okay. Let me figure out how to get to RingCentral. because I don't have it on my taskbar anymore. Okay. Okay. Alright, well I found it but I don't know how to open it You should be able to just double click it Yeah, it's not doing anything If you right click on it does it give you the option to open? No, if I right click it it doesn't do anything either Alright, go ahead and open up a web browser all right and go to the website meetings ring central comm okay hang on just one second I did have a tab up there for ring central and it's open select an item from the left message videos phone tests face go to video video yep you should see an option to join a meeting all right okay and then the meeting ID that you're going to enter is 452 506 509 okay then you'll hit join meeting alright we weren't able to start the meeting Then the pop-up went away. Want to try join meeting again? Yeah. All right. ID again? 452. Oops. Hold on a second. 452. Okay. 506. Okay. 509. Unable to start meeting, check your network connection and try again. It sounds like you might just be having some connection issues and that's why that popped up in your Outlook as well. alright do you want to try giving your computer a restart see if that message pops open again sure and then if it does give us a call back but it sounds like that's what's happening it's having trouble connecting to PC Recruiter when you're opening Outlook and not being able to connect to the RingCentral meeting as well ok so go ahead and give your computer a restart And if that pops up again, just give us a call back in. Okay. All right. Thanks. Yep, not a problem. Bye-bye. Bye....
