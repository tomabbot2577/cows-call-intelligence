## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, Sandy Bishop with the Bishop Group. How are you? Good. How are you doing? I'm good. Hey, I've got a question. I have never used PCR to post send-outs, and I want to start doing that. So, you know, if this takes longer than you've got time for, let me know. We'll do it another day. But I just wondered if you could walk me quickly through how you do it. I've been playing around with it this weekend and totally befuddled by it. Okay. So when you say spendouts, what's another word for that? Interviews. Interviews. Steps in the hiring process. Oh, okay. So it seems like you want to use the pipeline feature where you can track a candidate through the different steps of the hiring process? Correct. My company calls them interviews or send-outs. okay um by the way that's where i went to pipeline but i couldn't i'm assuming you need to attach this to a job order am i right correct yeah when you create a position record in pcr it'll have a pipeline attached where you can add people in and then move in through that pipeline um are you in the Bishop Group database or the default database? Bishop Group. Okay. Let me log in and see which version of the pipeline you're on. There's a legacy version and then a new version. I'm on PCR9 right now. I just ordered your new PCRM and I realized I got to start doing things different. gotcha yeah so you have the new pipeline not the legacy one okay that makes sense so I'm in a company named Wago and if I go into that pipeline okay it's got all this the job is a zone manager and then to the right of it has all these arrows Is that where you're supposed to put your interview information? You would actually want to go to the zone manager position record rather than the company record. So go ahead and open up the zone manager. Okay, I'm doing that. All right, I'm in there. Now go to pipeline. Exactly. That will open up the pipeline in a new tab. So open pipeline and then I tab what? So, yeah, you'll have a new tab open that has that pipeline. You should see the inbox on the left. Yes. Middle. First interview, second interview. Okay. So this is the pipeline for a zone manager specifically for the Wego Corporation. You have one person in the inbox. you can click on the word inbox to expand it or collapse that step. And if you want to add a new person into that inbox to be considered for Zone Manager, expand the inbox to where you see the little search bar at the top in the blue inbox bar to search and add the pipeline. It's got a person's head with a plus. Yes. It should be. Oh, actually, no, it should just say inbox in blue in a blue bar. And you should have a search bar directly to the right of that search bar to the right of that. So are you seeing I am put one person in here and I think I got them in. Are you looking at the same thing I'm looking at? Yeah, so I pulled up the zone manager position, and I went to the pipeline tab, and it should say inbox as one of the steps, submittal as one of the steps. Got that. And I see this guy's face to the left of that. Called Bill Ryan? Yeah, Bill Ryan. So is he entered as an interviewer or not yet? So he's in the inbox, and so he's being considered for the zone manager position. You can click and drag Bill Ryan to any of these steps to the right of that. So there's submittal, first interview, second interview, third interview, offer. Left click or right click? Left click and drag. And drag. Drag him over to any of those other steps. to inbox or to the arrow above inbox? So he should be in inbox currently right now. Okay. There's a head, a circle, an outline of a head with a plus. Is that him then? Okay, yeah. I think we are looking at two different things. I'm not sure. Let's see. I'm in zone manager. I clicked on pipeline. That's where I am. Doesn't new window open up or does it stay in the same window? Does what stay in the same window? So like, for example, your PCR window probably has basic search up at the top and then zone manager down at the bottom, in the bottom frame. Are you seeing those two frames? No. Okay. What I'm seeing is I'm seeing his face on the left, and at the top, arrows going across, 1-1, 1-0, 0-0. I'm sorry, 0-0, going across to the right. And then down below that, it says inbox to middle, first interview. I mean, am I supposed to click on that stuff or what? Yeah, so we're on the same page again. So click on the word inbox in blue. Okay, yeah. Does that expand or collapse? Well, when you say expand, it moves submittal to the right of that. Right, okay. So clicking on any of those steps, whether it's the word submittal, whether it's the word inbox, will expand and collapse the step. And you would want to do that so you could see the names that are sitting in that step. So inbox is a step. Submittal is a step. So if you click on inbox, you should see Bill Ryan listed there. If you click on inbox again, it should collapse and i...
