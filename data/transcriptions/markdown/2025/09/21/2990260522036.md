**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Please hold while I try to connect you.

**[0:11] Speaker_02:** Robert speaking.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** Hi, Robert.

**[0:15] Speaker_00:** This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence.

**[0:16] Speaker_02:** Hey, how are you?

**[0:18] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:19] Speaker_00:** So I have a question for you.

**[0:21] Speaker_00:** Well, actually, a couple things.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** So we sent you an invoice for your upgrade.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** For your new features, it was going to include some training as well.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** Yes.

**[0:33] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:34] Speaker_00:** So with that invoice, we mistakenly applied tax.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** We removed it because you are in Ohio, but that type of service should not be taxed.

**[0:43] Speaker_03:** So we removed the tax.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** That only applies to your monthly.

**[0:48] Speaker_00:** So that was our mistake.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** And we re-sent it.

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** I just want to know, do we have the right billing email address?

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** I don't know.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** And Vaughn Johnson at Cersei Mourik?

**[1:01] Speaker_00:** Is that who you should be using?

**[1:02] Speaker_01:** Yeah, but she's on maternity leave right now.

**[1:05] Speaker_01:** So do me a favor.

**[1:08] Speaker_01:** Do you have Mark's email address, right?

**[1:11] Speaker_00:** Oh, I'm sure I have it somewhere.

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** The invoice is still open because I know we had Eileen Follenkamp before.

**[1:18] Speaker_00:** So it's been changed.

**[1:19] Speaker_01:** Do you have my email address?

**[1:23] Speaker_00:** I can put it as yours if you want.

**[1:24] Speaker_01:** No, I don't want it as mine.

**[1:26] Speaker_01:** I don't, but I will.

**[1:27] Speaker_00:** Okay, and I have it.

**[1:29] Speaker_01:** If you send it to me, I will send it to the folks who are taking care of this when Maggie's out.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** And you'll get, so just put, you owe us money, and here's everything updated.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** Well, here's the other thing I could do, though.

**[1:41] Speaker_00:** Hold on one second.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** Let me pull it up just to make sure here.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[1:45] Speaker_00:** It looks like you do have auto pay enabled with a card ending in 2054.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** If you want, because we would need this invoice paid before, it's kind of been like sitting and waiting.

**[1:55] Speaker_01:** I could just auto pay that one invoice and that way we move forward with getting the upgrades going if that's okay with you I wanted to ask you first um I I have DJ I'm not managing that so like I said but it'll get done today like I'll have somebody reach out to you today okay um does that help you yeah I don't know any like I'm a moron when it comes to this stuff but I mean But if I send an email, it'll get done.

**[2:22] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:22] Speaker_00:** Yeah, because the – And I will copy you on the email.

**[2:26] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:27] Speaker_00:** Yeah, so the card, if they want to use AutoPay, is $20.54, and all they have to do is literally click a button.
