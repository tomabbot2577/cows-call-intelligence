## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, you are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Hello, do you hear me now? Hello? Hello? Hello, do you hear me now? I can hear you now. Awesome. I got kicked out. My call got disconnected. I don't know why. I don't know if an Internet hiccup or a RingCentral issue, but my phone just went dead, and I was still in the meeting, and the Internet doesn't seem to have hiccuped, so I don't really know what happened. We kind of lost you right before that keypad appeared. At least that's when I noticed there was no audio. Yeah, the keypad was, I was, my ring central, I was dialing back in to get dialed back in. I don't know, yeah, my phone kind of got disconnected, but nothing else did. And I'm sitting here at the table and nothing changed. I don't know what happened. But anyway, anyway, so kind of finishing up here to talk about the job board. You heard I was talking about, You can post jobs to your website. You can let candidates apply online. You decide what information they're going to be asked to provide. And essentially, this is going to act like a job board. Cool part about that is you can also set up a feed to Indeed, Zip Recruiter, or if you have, I think you can set up a feed of some portions of LinkedIn, too. So you can feed your jobs to be able to get those fed out. And then the applicants can come back to your website and apply online. Okay, so you can do some different things with that. So that's going to be something, it'll interface with any website, it'll match well, you're going to have no problem doing that. And then you're also going to have the ability to work within the pipeline. And the pipeline is going to be a combination of everyone who has applied online. Okay, so I can look at this pipeline here and the inbox is going to be everyone who has applied online. then I can move them on through my custom interview process. So you have up to 18 steps here. You can redesign, pick your own color, pick your own terminology, put them in whatever order, and then you're going to be able to just drag and drop people from one step to the next as you move them through your process there. So that's going to be a nice, easy way of tracking who's where in the process here. So you're going to be able to just kind of very easily move them on through. and that interview process can differ so if you have more than one process I can go into a different job opening here and if I go into pipeline that's going to show me a slightly different process that I have for this job you see it's a little bit longer my colors different some different terminology different things like that so you're able to take it just very easily move them on through when people apply to the job is there any sort of ranking that's being done in terms of like most suitable candidates for that job based on who's applied? Not by default, but you can set something up to do that. So when they apply online, you can put in what we call a profile. So that might be a little questionnaire of your own design. And you're going to be able to set that up with any number of different questions. You can even, I think there's even a way to score the questions. So if everyone that applies online fills out the same profile, You can kind of score them against each other to see exactly who was the best fit, who answered the most questions in the best manner or something like that. So it would take a little setup, but you could do it. It doesn't automatically do it, though. But I will show you something else along those lines, and it will actually give me a chance to show you our other interface. So if I look at the PCRM piece, I'm logging into the exact same database, the exact same data, but through this interface. So this is actually a different interface. And it adds a few CRM features. So if I go on into here, I can see I have my names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. Same exact stuff. It's just down the left-hand side of the screen. Now, I'm going to go into a position here, and I'm going to see it was just released about a week ago, and I was out last week. So I don't know if it's where it is. But if I go into Radiological Control Tech, I should have an ability somewhere to match. There's an auto-match somewhere, and I don't know where they put it. So I'm just going to look around at a few things, see what I can find. Okay. Let's get that out of there. I don't know where it is. There is a button somewhere. So like I said, I haven't seen it. It's very new. There's a button somewhere that I can auto-match, and it'll pull up the closest 15 people that match basically the information found in the job description there okay okay okay so that's going to be something that you can do from there hang on just quick okay Okay. Okay. So kind of back into here. So, yeah, so there's an auto-match feature. Like I said, I don't know where it is. It's only been around a...
