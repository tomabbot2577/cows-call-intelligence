## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey good morning Robin this is TJ. Long time no here. I'm actually trying to get Tom's email fixed in our account, the admin. We've got it to the point where it's popped up. I'm going to pull up your stuff here. Why did you not come up? There it goes. Okay. So let me close down a bunch of windows I have going on here. Otherwise, I am just going to confuse myself. I know that feeling. So the more monitors you get, the more stuff you just open, right? yeah and then I unfortunately figured out a trick unintentionally that if you click a couple buttons on your Mac keyboard you actually can take one of your screens however many windows you have open and you can just put it in the background without seeing it um forget that you have like 10 windows open in the background. Oh. So it's going to be really slow. That is interesting. Okay. All right. So we are going into, okay, there's only one database. What's his username? He just goes into the admin? Okay. Yeah. He's got problems with his email? Yeah. Yeah, I got it to the point where I created the email file on the left-hand side, so I'm going to go like 100 times. But it's been a couple weeks now, and none of the emails have actually started typing in. Okay. Let me see. His username is admin. I'm going to say hey, Kira. T. Harbin at MedCare Staffing. That's the account, right? Mm-hmm. Correct. I'm at SSL. Okay. I'm testing. Okay. Email folders. And do we have a sent and a trash specified? He's got a lot of folders. Yeah, I know. That's why I let it go for quite a while before. Oh. I wonder if I got none of these have anything, huh? Not that I know of. I probably won't have it because I can't really tell anything on our side. Do you happen to know how many emails he probably has on there? Yeah, like 20 years worth. Oof. I wonder if it's just timing out even trying to get them. which also, I'll be honest, if it's got that many, it's going to greatly increase the size of your database probably. I thought this just mapped the server just as a mirror image kind of thing. Yeah, but still, I think it still takes up a little bit of size, from my understanding, right? Okay, this is all testing. okay the only thing I really do is see if I can have these I've been a couple weeks see Harbin and my care staffing yeah so that's all fine no errors I'm going to have to have the one of our server administrators see if they can find some error on the back end that it's not showing us every once in a while gets maybe hung up at a certain folder like if I'm trying to remember what it was somebody had an issue where they had something really odd in one of their folder names so it got so far but then got hung up because of that one folder name and it could be something like that but it's nothing that I can see so I'm gonna have yes I'm gonna see if they can find anything I did have I I did have a ticket at one point on the initial part, which was getting rid of his old emails. Let's see if I have this number. Yeah, that looks all clean. Yeah. So I didn't know if you wanted me to continue with that number. No, I'll do it. I'll do a new one. Now, which email do you prefer, Liberty Health or Seaboard Physicians? because it looks like I've oh yeah keyboard I have it forwarded okay PCR mail admin emails have not downloaded okay type technical support let me see and we have to assign this server administrator. He's got about 20 years of emails in his... Yeah, 10, 15 years. Long time. I don't think he's thrown anything away. I might be a problem or probably a problem. Okay, PCR mail has been configured. Do you remember about the date that this was set up? on the 31st of July they cleaned up the other stuff on the 31st? okay I'm sorry 30th or 31st? 31st I think okay that just helped 30th is when I got the email sorry July 30th I have for off a day it's okay so it was done and they are still not downloading Okay. Office 365 account. Mail server. Test passes. Email alias, test passes. Scent and trash folders selected. Use the ASP administrator to check back end for any potential errors. Okay, I created a ticket. See if there's any kind of visible error that they can see on the back end as it's actually trying to get them, which might be something that we can see. But I'm just saying based on the number of folders, he probably has a whole bunch of email things. Is there a way to, I guess, manipulate his account where he only has a few folders, like a workable folder to bring in to PCR? Or that's a whole new email account for that? I think the thing probably would just be if this is the issue just with so many folders and emails and then it might just be that maybe he just needs to clean up emails. Because we're actually, you know, connecting to the mail server. So if there's like a whole bunch to grab, it could just be that it's timing out. Yeah. Okay. I guess somebody on the back side can run the diagnostic and if that's the case then we'll have...
