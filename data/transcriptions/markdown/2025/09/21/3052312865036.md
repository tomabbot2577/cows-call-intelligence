## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. How are you doing? This is David Hill down in San Antonio, Texas, with Riverwalk Executive Search. How are you? Doing good, Robin. How's it up there in Ohio, right? That's where you are? We're warm. Yeah, we're warm for now. What's warm? Because San Antonio probably thinks it's cool. what is it what is it today today it's 82 today oh my god that's not warm yeah well actually we've been actually we've had um for several weeks it's not too bad today been very humid and pretty hot like around 90 and very humid okay well we're about 10 degrees well i mean we're just normally 10 degrees hotter than that. I mean, our normal is about 98 right now, 99. And then heat index is about 101, 102. So it's hot. You know, it's really hot. This time of year is hot. You don't want to visit San Antonio at this time of year. It's terrible. Terrible. It'd be like visiting Cleveland in the middle of January, I guess. Oh, you don't want to do that. No, exactly. It's about the same extreme, just opposite. Well, Robin, I've got a question. I know I've had this problem before with mine and I think it was Garrett that fixed it. My wife now, Christy, she's having the same problem and I don't exactly know how we got into it, but somehow what she's doing when she goes to send her emails it's indexing to my email it's under her name christy hill but then it's my email address so okay let me see something with that stmp or whatever it's called i'm not a techie i don't know but i know that they got into like you know that that stuff to fix it okay what is her username let me check her alias and see how it's set up yeah her her username is k like christy k and then h-i-l-l okay let me see what she's got for her sometimes if somebody doesn't have one it uses what's in the outgoing mail settings as a backup which if it was yours for that then that could be an issue let's see well maybe i mean you know and i don't know i mean i can fix it if She'd tell me what to do and I'd get in as her or you could share my business or whatever. Oh, okay. I see what's going on for some reason. Oh, that's really weird. She has some drop down that she's had for 15 years where she could drop down when we used to have sticky IT back in the old days. Because we've had you guys for almost 20 years. And there was some drop down. You could, like, change how you wanted to send it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, for her username, she's got three email aliases set up. Now, is it Office 365 now? Because that one, which is her default, actually, it's not set up correctly. No, it's not. It's not. It's not. Well, let me say, if she's sending it out of high-quality leadership, yes, that is Office 365. It is. Okay. Yes. So that's her default. Now the problem what I see, and maybe, did you maybe authenticate as yourself trying to do it for her? Maybe pulled over your credentials? I think I did. I think I tried to pick it up and screwed it up. I think I did. So is she at her computer right now? I'm signing, she's in the kitchen, but I'm signing on as her right now. Okay. So if you're at her computer, okay, let me know when you're there and ready, and I'll walk you through the steps. Okay. Thank you, Robin. No problem. I know it wasn't that hard, but I don't know how to do it, you know? Yeah. Sometimes what happens if you're, like, let's say you're trying to help her from your own computer and you try to sign in. Sometimes you're already signed into your own account, and then it tried to pull your credentials instead. That would be my guess. I think that's what happened. I do think that's what happened. Yeah. So in that case, if you were trying to do it for her, you would either need to log out of your Office 365 or you have to open up your browser like in an incognito window, which doesn't recognize that you're signed in. Then you would be forced to put in like the username and things like that. So let's see if we can, if you're at her computer, let's see if we can get this resolved for her then. Okay. I am. So I think I went to like configure or something like that. Yeah, I'm going to first take you, let's see, I think, well, the incoming, let's see if that's still good. Well, I just fixed that. I fixed that with, who was it that I talked to the other day? Well, that one, wait, hold on one second, because that one has two setups, and I'm not sure why. Let me see, why do you have two setups? because well here's why because she gets she gets one feed from uh home page universe which is her riverwalk search which is forwarded but that's forwarded to that's actually forwarded to high quality leadership so really she only gets it from one yeah now i see um the office 365 set up twice her K Hill or Christy Hill. Let me just, I don't think we need both of these. I don't think so. I don't think so. We could test it, but if you want to get rid of it, yeah. Yeah, it seems like we just want to get rid of one of these. I think you'r...
