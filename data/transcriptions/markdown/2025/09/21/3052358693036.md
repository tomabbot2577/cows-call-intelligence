## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Oh, hey, Tyler. This is Lee Froman from the Dunwoody Group. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. I got kind of a stupid question. I'm having a hard time searching for things, and I don't know where the manual is. Where is it? How do I find that? Yeah, so we do have a webinar on searching in our Learning Center, as well as some articles. So if you go to learning.pcrecruiter.net. Learning.pcrecruiter.net. Okay. And you'll see we have webinars, that webinars section over on the right-hand side. Okay. Hold on. I was bringing this up for the future. PC Recruiter. Okay. And then it's the webinars. Okay. Yep. And then the third one down is searching in PC Recruiter. I need to watch this. There's nothing I can pull down then. So there is, too. I was just showing you that one first. So go ahead and hover over home and hit PC Recruiter 9. Home. Home where? Up at the top. You'll see that navigation. on the learning thing or on my PC Recruiter? On the Learning Center. Home. Oh, I see. You'll see Home. Yep. And then PC Recruiter 9. And then if you scroll down that list about halfway, you'll see a magnifying glass, one for all our searching articles. If I'm looking just in how to actually do a roll-up, how would I find it then? Like how to create a roll-up list? Not how to create a roll-up. How to search. I want to search for names of specific titles in a certain zip code. How would I search on how to do that? So that would be an advanced search. Oh, I see it. Okay, I see it on here. Because the advanced search will have that zip code radius option. Yeah, it's not the zip code radius, it's the titles. When you put percentage in front of a title, it means it's anywhere, right? Correct. Anywhere in the title? Yes. And do I do comma or do I do or after that? You would do a comma. So if I'm looking for somebody who's got sales in their title or somebody who has trade in their title, I would put percentage sales, comma, percentage trade, comma? You wouldn't put the second comma if you're only looking for two values. Yes, correct. But otherwise, what's the difference between the comma and then or? so the or is only used in the delimiters so in those basic search fields the comma acts as the or so that sends the search a little the basic search box sends it a little bit differently because certain things are implied in those searches in the advanced search you would use the or but you could also use the comma because the or delimiter is assumed in the basic search. So if I'm doing percentage sales, comma, percent trade, that's basically saying it's got sales or trade in the comma and make title. Correct. Correct. Okay. And then it will, if I did the zip code, it will only give me people within that zip code radius. so if you do a zip code in the basic search it only finds that exact zip code no i'm talking advanced sorry oh in advance yes yeah okay i must be okay i'll look i must be doing some work because you give me way too many numbers i must be okay i'll have to look at it then okay i have all the information i think i can look now yep yeah so about halfway down that advanced search one it will show you that zip code radius one yeah i see it on here okay thanks so much for your help. Yep, not a problem. You have a great day. Thank you. You too. Bye-bye....
