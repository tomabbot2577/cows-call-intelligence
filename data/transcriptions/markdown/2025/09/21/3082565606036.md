## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Kate Sunstein. I'm calling from Andrews & Cole, and I'm calling in regards to a question regarding integration with RingCentral. We recently noticed that when sending text out of PCR through RingCentral that are not a mass text, they're simply just like a text to an existing candidate or client, they're automatically adding in that opt-out message and it's making it seem like an automated text but it's actually not because we utilize this as our main phone system how do i get rid of that so that's not part of a pc recruiter at all we don't add that in um okay but it's is it adding it at like the bottom of the text yeah right and it's like adding it for some people but not others. And so I'm trying to understand, and it's not like a text template, like somebody's going into the, like to the person's record and creating a text kind of deal. And it's adding it. But like when you can, when you send from the RingCentral app, like there's an option to not include it, which you can do. But if a lot of times we use PCR to text people directly or just to make sure, you know, you can kind of keep it in the system, but now it's adding in this opt-in message? So, since it's RingCentral adding it in, like, once we pass it over to their system, we have no control over that. Okay. Let me see. I'm looking it up right now to see if there's a way to just, like, automatically turn that off within RingCentral. All right. I'm trying to see. Okay. Because you were saying when you do it from RingCentral, is it something that like pops up and asks if you want to add it? No, it doesn't pop up, but there's basically a little like checkbox at the bottom, like when you have an existing text or when you go to create a new text on the app, at least on the computer app that says like you can check to add in the opt-out message. So if you don't check it, it doesn't get included in those. Gotcha. Yeah, I'm seeing it there now. And are these numbers that have been texted previously? Usually, yes. And if you go into that message thread, it's not checked? I don't know. I'm getting this from a couple of people, so I'm kind of troubleshooting on behalf of the firm. Some people are getting it, some people are not, so I wanted to be able to send out a message to basically adjust your settings accordingly. like if you're sending a true text, like you're not including it. I mean, it's one thing if we're sending like a marketing text, which we don't really do. But if we were, then we would look, you know, then I would expect that we would be adding an opt-in message or we're sending these kind of texts that are like, hey, we've interviewed you. We're trying to get you, you know, to sit with a client. Like I don't, you know, I don't want a text because it makes it seem like it's some automated test, but it's actually a person on the other end. So that's kind of the challenge here. yeah I understand I'm just trying to look because like I said we have no control over that like when the way the integration works is we just pass the message over to ring central and how they send it with their opt-out settings isn't up to us at all I would maybe contact them and see if there's a way where that can be turned off for like singular text messages. Just like across the board. I wasn't finding anything on their help side, but. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What we surfaced was looking was basically like, oh, there's there's like saying that there was like a text template. And I was like, yeah, that's not that's not what's happening. You know, maybe that's happening for some people. that's not what's happening in this circumstance. So, okay. All right. Do I just call like, I guess like their main like helpline and try to talk to somebody? Yeah. Or you can start a chat on their website and they'll usually give you someone that you can call. Okay. Awesome. All right. Well, thank you so much for your help. I appreciate it. Not a problem. You have a great day. You too. Bye-bye....
