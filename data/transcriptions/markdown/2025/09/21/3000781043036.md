It's probably a loading though, huh? I'm not sure. It says test connection, add connection, remove connection. Right. Okay. Yeah, you got to add your connection. You want to hit add connection. Okay. You haven't done this part yet, right? You haven't added a connection yet? you just installed it, right? That's it. I just installed it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You're going to have to connect it to your PCR database then. So yeah, you want to hit add connection and then you're going to want to enter in your like URL, which I could give you and your username and password, which I cannot give you, but hopefully you know it. So, and where it says name, just hit my username. Oh no, I got it. What's my server? server server says server paste url here the url okay great okay yeah so um i have my url i was gonna say yeah i was like do you know it or do you want me to read it off because it's just the url that you log into pcr with so it'll be like oh yeah It's going to be like HTTPS colon. Hold on. It won't let me do anything. Oh my gosh. PCR. There you are. Oh. I'm in Outlook Classic, so it's still all catching up. Oh, yeah, it's probably syncing your email.
