## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, you've reached Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. My name is Erin Monahan. I'm sorry to stalk you. I had to cancel my contract early, but for some reason I thought I had this data link until August 5th, which is when my contract ended. I just paid to end it early, but I thought I paid to August 5th. I just need the resumes. I don't need any of the detailed data that it's formatted in. so I think it said it was I just realized that the database download link was after for 30 days so I think it's like 5 days later right now am I okay to have that data and if so can I have another link sent to my phone my IT guy is helping me download the data and save it I just need the code just sent to my phone again sure so hi Erin hello I recognize the name and know what's going on. Awesome. So that was a lot. Let me just kind of think about it for a second. So, all right. So I thought it was kind of wrong. I did. Okay. So I do things based on the billing, like the person in the billing will tell me like, hey, like make this adjustment. I've changed their account. Yeah. And I do recall she told me to like go ahead and close it. and I don't know if she maybe like forgot a clause of the sentence that or something but I was like oh that's odd because I think in the conversation in the ticket it did say you were gonna be open to like August 25th or whatever and I was gonna like I or I you know I don't know but then she just told me to immediately close it so maybe that was an error but if all you really need is the um the resumes and stuff that's already in the data return that I sent you. So, yeah. So if you can access those links, um, there's two links and I do kind of explain this in the email that I typically send, but the, the one that has the, like the word docs in it, the OCS, uh, that one will download a, like a zipped up file. Um, it'll be a dot R A R file. file you could open it with the winrar program that you can get for free uh on the other link that we sent you there like a win it's like rarlab.com or whatever uh so so as long as you get the docs file like downloaded uh back it up probably to like a hard drive or you know whatever somewhere and then okay from there like you always have access to those uh those are your like resumes and attachments of the database. So your IT guy probably will know better what to do with it or know like how to unzip it if you want to see the resumes and stuff. You will need that password. I could send the password again to the phone number on the data return form. I can't send it to any other number that you asked me to send it to though. Yeah, no worries. So hopefully it's the same number. Sorry, I've been talking kind of not at my microphone. Oh, no worries. I've heard you perfect. Okay, great. Okay, so let me, I'll just send it right now. Can you confirm that you get it? Sure. All right, give me one sec to pull up the ticket and resend the password. I just need like a refresher on the number, but don't tell me. Sure. All right, so Erin, how do you spell your last name, Erin? Monahan, M-O-N-A-H-A-N. EFM recruiting and then data return form okay so I have this number here see the conversation we had I'm basically just going to copy and paste the same message cool for a similar message I'm going to make it simpler there backspace out that part you don't really need it makes it easier to copy uh all right perfect i got it all right so yeah the docs link will have all your resumes and attachments and stuff when you download it it make sure to give it enough time to download it's probably a bigger file you know so it might take a bit and before you want to move that file anywhere you want to make sure it finishes downloading and then you could like unextract it with the winrar program and then you'll be able to like see the you know a folder of files got it perfect thank you so much yeah you're welcome perfect anything else that's it i feel much relieved thank you so much yeah you're welcome is it okay that the account was closed um yeah do you need access to it and until august 25th no i don't think so i just need the resumes and make sure i can have them for future when i can afford to upload them again just yeah okay all right well then yeah just to be sure like i would download that file and then maybe like back it up in like just more than one spot i don't know on your hard drive computer maybe like a thumb drive okay you have at least like two copies of it um okay cool and you should be good to download to a thumb drive okay cool thank you so much you're welcome have a good rest of your day week okay you as well have a good summer yeah thank you awesome bye all right...
