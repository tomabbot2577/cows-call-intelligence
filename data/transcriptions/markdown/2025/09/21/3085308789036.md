## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Jason Johnson over at Neely Pierce. We have a bit of a quandary. I've been a PCR user for 19 years, and Truett Neely has asked me to perform a task neither of us can figure out. So we're hoping you guys can help us out with this. All right. So we have recently done an import which put emails into a new email category. we're left with 20 something thousand names that have an email address in a custom category we call email personal and he wants that field eliminated so what i'd like to do is move anybody who has an email in email personal which is a custom field into the email you know the main email predefined field but i don't know how to move things from a custom field to a predefined field globally Oh, gotcha. Okay, so we have, yeah, we only have the copy custom to custom and copy predefined to custom. So in order to do that, you would have to do an export of the data and then re-import it, switching the information from one column to a different column name in your CSV file after export. That's what I figured. Yeah, that's the only real way to do a move from custom over to predefined is through the export and import process. Okay, I thought you might say that. So here's what, let me explain what he wants done and make sure that I understand from you the way it needs to be done. So he would like to say, I don't know if you can see our screens, we've got three fields, email work, which is a custom field, email main, which is the predefined field, and then email personal, which is a custom field. So he wants, if anybody has an email in email personal, he wants that moved to email main. And if there is already something in email main, he wants that record skipped. So what I was thinking was I do a query and I say email personal is not empty and email main is empty. So only pulling those records. So start off with only exporting those. Can you think of any better way to do it? No, yeah, that's a great starting place with that advanced search. One is empty, one is not empty. And then when you export, I would include in the export the identification field. Is that something you have experience with? I can give you a rundown. No, and in fact, when y'all said that to me once before and I went to do the export, the export looked different than I had seen previously. I haven't exported in so long until I did so like two weeks ago. So if I pull this search up, maybe you can walk me through that export because I think I'm missing a step somewhere. Okay, yeah, absolutely. All right, so real quick, let me pull this. I guess I need to roll it ready up. So I'm going to say predefined field email address is empty, and custom field email personal is not empty. So that gives me 21,000 names. I'm rolling them up now alright That's a big list. It's working. Nice. Thanks for helping us. Would a screen share be helpful? Do you want me to do that, or are we good? Yeah, we can. I mean, I think we're good so far, but yeah, if you prefer that, we could always jump over to one. I'm a quarter way through this roll-up here, so it's still going. Okay. The next step, once we get that, will be adjusting the columns displayed in your roll-up list. Okay. So that we can see... Oh, that's why we need an export. ...whichever column we want to... Okay. Right, yeah. Cool. Yeah, whatever columns you see is what you get in your export. So we'll definitely add a column called identification. And then we can use that as the duplicate checking criteria on the import. I could say if the identification field matches that, you know, it is a we don't need to create a duplicate type thing. And that'll make sure every record is getting updated based on a unique identification number. So we're not going to lose activities or anything like that either, right? Right. Yeah. Nothing will be lost. We'll just be updating records that already exist with basically two fields, email address, email personal. So when we have somebody that's imported, let's say, so I think a lot of these imports came from like 2010 or 12 or 14. And then now we're going to correct them. That person's activity is going to say import 2010 and import 2025, right? It's just going to show two imports. But the original, this person entered the database 15 years ago, that info is not going to be lost. Right. Exactly. Okay. Understood. Okay. It is rolled up. I'm going to refresh my screen just because I'm that kind of guy. And reopen. I got 21, 866. Okay. And I am back. Now we need to customize my screen. I have shown email address, email work, which are the two new ones, and email personal. So I need to add identifier to my screen, you're saying. Yeah, there'll be a field called identification. Okay, give me a second. I haven't done this in a minute here. Configure. What's it called? Configuration. Yeah, it would be in your action menu at the top right. Configure. It's a gear icon. Oh,...
