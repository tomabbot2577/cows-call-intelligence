## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Robin, this is Ernie Bivona. Maybe I can get solutions. I'm fine. I'm working from home because I had hip surgery Monday. But I'm on my computer, the same one that I use in the office. And if you look at what I'm working with, it's crazy. First of all, when you try to add a note, there's no place to type anything. It's crazy, and I don't understand why. And sometimes when I do a memo or an email to people, the white screen doesn't allow you to put any text in. Okay. And this has been happening. It could be that you need to... Are you in Chrome? Yeah. You might need to clear cache. Let's try this. I've done that. I did it yesterday. I did it twice. Okay. But I'll do it again. I'll do it again. Whatever you want me to do. So if you go to the three vertical dots... Right. And then select delete browsing data. Make sure the time range says all time. But only select. I've got to go to under more tools or delete browsing data. Okay. Okay. So what you're going to have to do is where it says time range, you're going to select that to all time. Okay. And then where it says cached images and files, that's the only one that you want to select. So uncheck everything else. Okay. That's it. And then hit delete data. Okay. They didn't have me do that this time. Last time. We're going to try this. I mean, sometimes this is it. We'll see if this is it. It's troubleshooting step number one. Yes, so what you're going to want to do is fully exit Chrome after you delete your cache dimensions and files. Okay, well, let's go through everything. Delete, delete, delete. Okay, I think I'm completely gone. What's this? That's Firefox. Okay. Well, maybe, you know what? Maybe I'll delete all that too. I'll delete everything. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. What are you trying to... What are you talking about deleting everything? Whatever was on Firefox. I'll delete all that stuff. We don't support Firefox. Are you using Firefox or are you using Chrome? Chrome. I'm just deleting whatever files I have open. Okay. So yeah, no, we won't have anything to do with Firefox. We don't support Firefox. So once you fully exit Chrome, go back into Chrome and then go back into PCR and try the same action again. I'm just trying to get to where, let's see. Well, it's a little bit better. Add a note. It's a little bit bigger. Before, it was just a thin line. And let's see if I can send an email. What is it going to show me? it's better but not before I couldn't even add an email no space to write so that's better alright thank you you are welcome have a good week bye Thank you. Thank you....
