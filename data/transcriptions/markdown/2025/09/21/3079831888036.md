## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a voicemail here that you're having trouble with PCR. Oh, hey, Garrett. One second. Let me just turn off the podcast. Sure. Yeah, so as it relates to both the AEPA. All right. So, Gary, one of our users, his username is esteph, E-S-T-E-P-H, E-N-S, wants to be able to edit the LinkedIn URL on name records, and he's not able to. I am able to on an admin login, and I can't find a setting for him to be able to do that. Let me take a look here. So which databases? You have three. You have one called Network, one called PCRM, and one called Provision People. We do the one on Network. Network, okay. All right. So I'm going to log in as... Let's see. East Stevens. Okay. So there is, let's see, there's a LinkedIn logo to the left of the screen in that list of social media icons. I am able to click in and edit that, signed in as E. Stevens, but there is no LinkedIn field in his name record layout. Is that maybe what that person was looking for, an actual field to edit? Okay, give me a second. Let me click on that link. Sorry, I have you on speaker because I had to charge the phone. Okay, no problem. Hold on. Sign into LinkedIn Talent Solutions. When I click on that LinkedIn icon, it takes me to a LinkedIn page? Yeah, it's going to take you to the page of the person that you clicked on right to their LinkedIn profile. So that's one button. If you needed to edit what was saved in that button, meaning edit the link that's associated with that name record, you could either put it as a field on your record layout here, so it's listed in one of the fields called LinkedIn. The user that I signed in as, E. Stephens, does not have that field put into their layout. the other way to edit what the actual LinkedIn link takes you to is clicking on the three dots at the bottom of that list of icons on the left that'll let you hit the edit button and start changing that around oh okay so uh we did find that um those three dots at the bottom we tried that on his view, he doesn't have the edit, the little pencil icon that allows him to edit. Oh, okay. Interesting. Yeah, I'm signed in as him currently, and I'm seeing that as part of the next to the LinkedIn website link. It does have that edit. I'm able to type in there and save changes. so it does look like it's working for easy okay so here on my end I will click on the three dots and then you have that edit icon you said yeah it's like a little pencil next to the web address next to the web address huh okay I can't No, I'm not seeing it, but I do have the LinkedIn field on the right side. Let's try that path. On the field on the right side of the name record under edit name, how do I add that field to his view? Oh, you can, as an admin user, copy your record layout to other users. and you can do that by going to system in the main menu up at the top. Okay, system. And then users on the left. Users on the left. Manage users on the right. Manage users on there. And then where is that? Oh, you know what? I'm sorry. I led you down the wrong path. Go to system again up at the top. and then so we want users on the left and copy user settings on the right. Copy user settings. Okay. There it is. Okay. And then at the top left, you should see a drop-down where you can choose your username, where it says source username. Yep. Okay. Hold on. Source username, I will put CLE. Is your username available in that dropdown? I don't think so. It's supposed to be CLE-admin. Okay. So we need to switch your username over to what's called a model user so that settings can be copied from that. Okay. So let's do that first. I'm going to click for myself first. Yep. Manage users. Exactly. Manage users, pull up your username. And in the bottom frame, it'll say like your username, and there's a spot to put your password. Right next to that, it says model user in a dropdown. Found it, and I am changing it, and I am saving. Excellent. Okay, then I think I need to go back to system. Yep, system users. Copy. Okay, CLE-admin, admin. Okay, then do I choose name, company, position records? Correct, and then just check the box next to name in the record slash search layout column. Okay, record, okay, found it, clicked it, and then... On the right, just select the correct username that you want to copy all the settings to. Okay, that would be E. Stephens for Ed Stephens. I click save. Awesome. All right, cool. Could you write on your end? Yeah, let me log out and log back in as E. Stephens, and I will make sure I have in the layout, let's see, edit name. Yep, I'm seeing LinkedIn on the right and definitely able to edit it. I took a slash off the end of the web address and hit save. Let me just put the slash back now. Okay, cool. Yeah, that is working. So they could either use that field to edit or they can click the three dots at the bottom of the list of social icons to edit. Alrighty, cool. All right, Garrett, I think ...
