## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Teresa, and I'm with CAE, or the Harrison Group out of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. And I have a couple of questions in regards to our PCR. Yeah, what's going on? The first question is, is it possible to send an email blast that says something about, like, if you would like to get notified by text and then there would be a box to say yes or no and then we get alerted to it. Is that possible? So you can do it with a profile. What was your company name again here? I think it's probably under, it's either CAE or the Harrison Group. Okay. I have a Harrison Group, but that says that that contract was canceled. No, that's not it. Then it must be under CAE. Let me see what our contract actually says. Let's see. I just signed a new contract, so let me see what it's under. It says Harrison Group, Inc. on my agreement. I was looking at the Harrison group. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. All right. Let me get you here. So with which database are you working? I'm in the EasyHire one right now. so are you using the ring central integration you're there hello yes can you hear me oh yep sorry are you yes we are yes okay so So are you trying to just get people, like are you trying to send like a mass text or just get approval to text people? Yeah, either by email or text. You know how you get those emails that says if you want to opt in or opt out? Yeah. So that's what we want to do. And then, like, is it automatic then to their profile, or how does that work? So we do have an opt-in list for texting. Okay. What's your username for the database? I am under CM. That's easy enough. But if we send it and they opt out, we can no longer text them, correct? Correct. Okay. What if we sent an email that says something, you know, how you have a box you can click, yes, I want to be notified of new jobs or no, I don't want to be. so you can do that with PCR profiles okay do you have a sample of that there's samples of profiles in the database can you do it with a check like a check mark yes or an X with a no where would I see that So if you go to System, Database Setup, and then Profile Setup. It's the same things where you build out like candidate data sheets. Yeah, yeah. Let me just hold on. My thing timed out on me. So sorry. That wasn't very helpful of me. Okay. Let's see. Okay. So I'm going to go to – I'm sorry. go ahead again sorry uh system database setup yep and then profile setup okay so those profiles you can set up those check boxes now you won't be able to do like the opt-in opt-out with okay with emails with those um but you can get notified when they like complete the profile Okay. But it's not going to be like a simple email where they can click it. They'll like have to click a link to go fill out the questionnaire. Okay. But that's just filling out a questionnaire. That's not saying, yes, I want to be updated. They would just check the yes, I want to be updated. And then you would manually have to like mark them. So, and then with the... Now, just for, like, the SMS, there's a pre-built form letter in the system. Okay, and where would I find that? let me see where it is here you should have it if not I can copy it over for you okay looks like you don't have that one so let me grab that from my test database and put it in there for you um Thank you. Thank you. One second here, I'm just copying it now. It's okay. All right. So if you go to system, form letters. Okay. and you can either search by the search letter by SMS or just go to the last modified one letters that name interview job time it'll be a name letter I'm sorry and then last modified. Okay. Then you can click on that letter and do like the action edit. Okay. Yeah. To kind of see what it would look like. Yeah. Okay. And then, and we can edit this obviously. Yep. So whatever. So do you have the one with the check marks already? Like the yes or no out of an email? I do not. We would have to build that one together. Okay. Okay. I will see if we want that. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much with that. And then my next question is in regard to the sequencing. So when we're texting out of this sequencing, the text box comes over to the middle of the screen. can it not appear right where you're sending the text? Where it says task on the right-hand side of the sequencing? Can you not just see that it pops up clear over in the middle? Yeah, like when you click the task? Yes. That's how that's designed to work with that task screen. Okay. Right, but there's no, it can't just go in that box where underneath the task? No. Okay. So once we send it, we have to then go in and mark as completed. Is that not, can we not automate that? Like once we send it? Yeah. Oh, how do you do that? You just have it set as a manual step. When you're selecting the step in the template, instead of a manual SMS, you can make that an automatic SMS, as long as you're using the RingCentral integration. Okay...
