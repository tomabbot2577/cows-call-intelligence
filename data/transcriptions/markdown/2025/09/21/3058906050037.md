It's just you and me, none of them yet. None of them yet. But we were, you and I were both a minute or so early, so. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just working on PCR-emifying the website content, trying to, like, replace screenshots and things like that. it looked pretty much so when I looked at it last week. Yeah, it's getting there. Now I'm kind of like the homepage got done, but now I'm into the sub pages, things about features, stuff like that. There's just a lot of old, old, incomplete, outdated, old screenshots. So it needs to be done. Get the courier off of that. Get the courier off of that. God, thank God that's not up there anymore. But there definitely are things up there that don't need to be there anymore. I mean, mostly it's just a matter of all the old PCR screenshots that are not necessary or things that we didn't have a screenshot of before that we had a thing there, but there was no picture because it wasn't attractive. of um so i mean there's a lot of videos of pcr9 up there still but that's okay as long as there's something so i'm just trying to get it ready i mean the deals and all that stuff isn't in there yet so that'll have to find a spot as well you know just sort of but i'm kind of there's somebody hello hello hi how are you all right how are you well thank you good we're just waiting on everybody I'm sorry you're the only one so far from your end joining we're just waiting on everybody else I don't know who else I see that I guess we're still waiting on Heidi and Karen okay no worries Thank you. Hey, guys, sorry, I was just cutting off another meeting. I'm here. Sorry. I'm here. Excellent. Hello, everyone. Excellent. Hello, everyone. I guess we're doing cameras off. Cameras on? I don't know. No, I don't have my camera on. I always have mine off by default because I'm usually taking notes or sharing screens. And I don't think I have a working one at this desk. So we'll just have to look at you guys and be awkward. We can keep ours off if you want. That's fine. It's fine if you don't mind. I don't mind. I need to have mine on, otherwise I'll get distracted and multitask. Maybe I can get mine up and running here. I use my, my, I'm on a desktop, so, and it doesn't have a built-in camera. So I use my, I have an app that lets me use my iPhone as a webcam. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. So let me see. if it functions or not. It's okay, Drew. Hey, there it is. Yeah, hold on. Now I just need to find a place to set the phone where it won't fall over. I'll get there. But yeah, don't hold up on my behalf. Yeah, so yeah, want to show your own PCRM a little bit. And I don't know, have any of you seen PCRM? Have you looked at it? at all or is this the first time? I have. I have. Drew showed me around a little bit. Okay. We're going to kind of go through here and show you around a little bit. I'll get us started. Drew might have a different viewpoint of it or maybe he shows different things or stresses different things, so I'll kind of include him as well as we look at this. And, Drew, if you want to jump in or want to stress something or think of a better way or anything at all, just let me know. Sure. No problem. I don't know about anybody else, but I just froze. Did anyone else freeze? No. No? Nope. We can still see you. Did your screen freeze up? Yeah, everything froze, and I can't even find my mouse. So I don't know if you guys – I turned on the camera. I broke everything. Oh, you are frozen, Tara. Yeah. Are you sharing anything? Because I can't see anything, and I can't find my mouse. I just shared my – Can you kick me out? Can someone kick me out so I can maybe come back in? Sure. Yeah. Can I put you in the waiting room? Because I can't even use my mouse. What's that? I'm going to kick out. I've never kicked out. I don't know. I think if you go to the participants list, there's probably an option there. Yeah, because I can't even move my mouse. It's just completely the whole computer just went. Okay. I sent her to the waiting room. So that kicked her out of the waiting room. She's gone. So she is gone. So we'll see if that worked. I've never had to kick anyone out before. That's a good thing. There's always a first time for everything, I guess. We'll give her a second to kind of get logged in again, see if we can get her in. It's always something. Well, since Karen, just to, you know, not hold up the demo, if you don't already take a look around on PCR10, you can show Heidi and myself. Perfect. Yeah, I can get started. She can join in when she gets in. Excellent, excellent. So, yeah, so PC Recruiter. So PC Recruiter 10 is PCRM. So it has become kind of, it is one in the same.
