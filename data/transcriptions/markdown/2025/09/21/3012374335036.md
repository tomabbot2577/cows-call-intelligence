## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon, this is Jim. Jim, Steve Moger to share. How are you doing? I just was on another call. I'm excellent, thank you. I was just on another call and just couldn't take it while, and I saw you had called me. I wanted to talk to you about the AI support for PCR. I was looking at it myself the other day, and I was having some challenges. Can we just run through the functionality in the next few minutes? Yeah. Which part were you using? I managed to look at the summary. Let me just log in now. Unfortunately, they're digging up our street and that means that internet is not wonderful. Oh, no. Come on. What is going on here? That is so weird. How's your day going? Not too bad. Not too bad. I wish I could say the same. okay yes finally loading okay so let me just check I understand it what is going on there huh now I'm logging in and it says that my efficient my session has expired oh weird Okay. Might have timed out. But I've just logged in. Okay. So on the individual, I've gone into a name record, and I'm going to send them an email, if I remember correctly. If I want to send an email and telling somebody about a job, which way do I go? Do I go to the job first and then the email, or do I go to the name record and then... Probably you would go to the person's record, I would say, and go to the email button. And then when you go to the email button, you can use the generator to help generate an email from there. Right. I don't know what's going on here. And this should work just the same for Mac and PC, correct? Because I think... Oh, yeah. My piece is going weird. Let me just go get my Mac. Yeah, so either one should work just fine. My computer gods are not with me today. Okay, let's see. all right let me log in come on Everything's slept today. putting fiber in into our area and unfortunately everything has gone weird okay so open the name record and then click on the email yep and then there should be a little AI button in the second row of the email control fields at the top I see it and if you click that it's going to ask you kind of what tone you want to take and okay casual let me go through there okay and then what's the purpose of the email okay so I want to tell them about a job that isn't an option okay yeah you kind of maybe even at the bottom you'll see a blank screen you can put in there mention the sales job or something like that okay I want to tell them about the HR job in Macon okay okay that's pretty cool and then I think it lets you go back and forth like that you can add another bit of information or qualifier and go back and forth six or eight times maybe and then when you're ready to use it you can use the text or regenerate the same text. Okay, perfect. Okay, so that looks good. All right, I get that. I just wasn't sure how that... Okay, and now the job. I'll go to the job. And I want to make a summary of the job. So then I... Go to job description, right next to wherever the job description field is, and there's a little AI button on there. Job description, edit visit ways, job description down below job description okay great and I click that button I don't need to overwrite the current text there is already a job description there so how does it create the job description if there's already a job description there it's going to overwrite it and I think it's only going to take into account information to find in the fields of the job and the company So if you have one there, I've never tried it because I think it'll overwrite it. Okay, good. What about if I want to send a candidate summary? I try to do a, if I go to the summary, and there's an AI thing over there. Now, will the summary include a profile, or is it just the notes and the resume? The summary is just going to add the information into the summary screen, and it's just going to generate a little summary. It doesn't include anything else but that summary, and it generates that by taking information it sees in the fields and in the resume. So it's not going to include any attachments or anything else to that. Okay, that's a real pity. So that's something you can take to your developers, because if we've gone to the trouble of getting specific information about how many direct reports and other things, and that's included in our profile, that should be included. It's in a field somewhere? Yes, on the profile. Do you know what the profile is? Like the candidate record, right? Or are you talking about a PC recruiter profile? Yeah, PC recruiter profile. Like one of those questionnaire? Correct, exactly. We've had the suggestion and request to include profile information in those. I don't know if it's being done, but I'll throw it up again. Okay, great. Right, because if we've gone to all the trouble to get them to fill in a profile, then obviously that would be important. And what about if I've included stuff in the notes? I think that is generated in there. I believe, I know it's resume and I know it's field. I think no...
