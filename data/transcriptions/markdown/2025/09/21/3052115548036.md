## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Testing, can you hear me? I do. Hey, Jim. All right, good. Sorry, I had some audio things. We have new PCs and I hadn't used Zoom on this laptop just yet. So hold on. That was very good. Very good. Yeah. Thanks for doing this and kind of jumping on. Sure. I guess Josh isn't there anymore. So have we worked with you before? I don't remember. Apologies, because I don't. You may not have. I don't know if you have or not. I've been here 26 years, so I've worked with many people, but I don't. Maybe we have. Maybe we haven't. I don't know. Okay. No, that's fine. I'm sure we've interacted at some point. We've been using you guys since 2019. So, yeah. No, thanks for jumping on and doing this demo. Just some quick background. I mean, we obviously don't have the product, the PCR product that has the sequencing. I've just been doing a lot of internal work with our recruiters and we need to figure out something with regard to some automation and we've been exploring some AI tools there's just so many right and so it's a little bit overwhelming and there's just some I've got some curiosity in terms of some of the sequencing options that we could have with PCR I looked at the the demo that was on your guys' website. I don't know if it's the new version or the old version, but yeah, so wanted to get kind of a real live time kind of walkthrough of what this looks like and some of the benefits of it. Oh, for sure, for sure. Yeah, you all have, so you have the package that sequencing can plug into, but it looks like you had it before sequencing was released, so you don't have the sequencing piece. So the good news is to add it is no additional monthly. It would just be a one-time little setup of 250. So it's just a one-time setup to turn it on. That includes a couple hours training, but there is no additional increase to your monthly to add that, which is good. Okay. That's good to know. But yeah, let me share my screen here and I will show you around kind of a little bit about what it does. And by the way, is this, do you record these, like the actual video of these, just in case I want to replay this for staff? Is that possible? Let me do it. I will record it and I'll send you over the link that you get it from. Okay. And it'll record the audio and the video, correct? I believe it does. Yeah. Okay. All right. Cool. All right. All right. So, yeah. So, what the sequencing does, so it kind of adds it onto your existing package of PC Recruiter and it would actually add a whole new button, which opens a whole new area of PC Recruiter. So, I'll get logged into my database here. and then once I am in so the sequencing is actually it'll just turn on this new button up at the top here you'll see sequencing up at the top so what it will do it'll be a whole new sequencing piece and that sequencing button is going to be where you will go to build your templates where you also would have a to-do list of all the sequences you might have running that's going to be your to-do list and we'll talk about how those are going to are going to work once the sequence is running so essentially what a sequence is going to it's going to be like a drip campaign of sorts that is going to be tagged to a specific roll-up list. So once it's running on that roll-up list, you can either kind of build the template of the sequence and then select a roll-up list that's going to run on and turn it on. Right then, everyone on that roll-up list gets, let's say, the first email and starts down the road of that custom process. So it's going to run off that roll-up list, but if you add people later to the roll-up list, each one is going to start that new process as they are added to the roll-up list. So So you could have a sequence just kind of hanging out on a specific roll-up, and as you add people to it, each one starts the sequence as soon as they're added. So the sequences, if I go into sequencing here, this is going to show me kind of my different elements. Jim, are you able to expand your dialog box to make that bigger? If it ends up making it complicated, then no, don't worry about it. I have it full screen, so I can't do it. I don't know if you can, but I'm already full screen. Yeah, I can't get any bigger. Let me see if I can just – it's not the worst thing in the world. I'm just going to zoom in a little bit, and hopefully that works. I zoomed in just a little bit, too. It doesn't – no, it doesn't help on my end, so I'm going to go back to 100%. All right, go ahead. That actually is better. Thank you. Yeah, cool. So what I can do is if I go into my templates up here, this is going to be essentially all of the different templates that I have. You can build as many as you like. I think these two actually come with it. So when it is added, you get these two basic templates. It'll add a few form lett...
