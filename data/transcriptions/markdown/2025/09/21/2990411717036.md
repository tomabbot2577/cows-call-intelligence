## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Danny Moo.

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Please hold while I try to connect you.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** Hello?

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** Hi, Danny.

**[0:25] Speaker_00:** It's Robin again.

**[0:26] Speaker_01:** Hey, Robin.

**[0:26] Speaker_00:** I figured it out.

**[0:27] Speaker_00:** I figured out what the problem is.

**[0:29] Speaker_01:** Oh, did you?

**[0:29] Speaker_01:** Nice.

**[0:30] Speaker_00:** You're not going to like my answer probably, but I can tell you why.

**[0:35] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:36] Speaker_00:** You have a bigger database.

**[0:38] Speaker_00:** Your companies probably have a ton of activities.

**[0:42] Speaker_00:** Are you in a sim right now?

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Am I what?

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** Are you logged in as him right now?

**[0:50] Speaker_01:** No, but I can see his roll up.

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** Okay, because I'd have to change it for you.

**[0:55] Speaker_00:** So with his username, part of your configuration is to show the last activity date, which is fine because when you change an activity, rewrite it into a field.

**[1:08] Speaker_00:** However, his configuration at least also includes activity type.

**[1:14] Speaker_00:** so with that one because it's not actually stored in a field what it has to do is it has to run through all of the company activities find which one has the most recent date and then identify what's the activity type of that activity and that's a flowing account wow Yeah, that's going to cause a long.

**[1:39] Speaker_00:** So by removing, by keeping a last activity date, first I removed both of them from his layout temporarily.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** I'm like, I just want to see, like, because it finally opened.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** I'm like, okay, that usually tells me something about pulling data.

**[1:52] Speaker_00:** So I'm like, okay, well, there's last activity and there was last.

**[1:55] Speaker_00:** I took both of those off for a moment and it loaded up just fine.

**[1:59] Speaker_00:** I'm like, well, it's probably activity type once I thought of it.

**[2:02] Speaker_00:** so by taking last activity off where you don't see the type you just see the date of it now it opens immediately so that's why some of your small lists are going okay slower but when you have a bigger list for a lot of companies that have a lot of activities that's what's blowing it down.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:26] Speaker_01:** How do I change that?

**[2:28] Speaker_01:** Can I change that for per user?

**[2:31] Speaker_00:** I have it changed for him.

**[2:34] Speaker_00:** Now what you could do, what do you typically put in your layout?

**[2:39] Speaker_00:** Just stage, quick comments, company name, industry specialty, city, state, phone, username, and last activity.

**[2:45] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:46] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:47] Speaker_00:** As an administrator, here's what you can do.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** Cause you can always recustomize it if you want.

**[2:53] Speaker_00:** If you go to system, Mm-hmm.

**[2:56] Speaker_00:** Go to Users and go to Copy User Settings.

**[3:01] Speaker_00:** And don't do anything else until I tell you what to do.

**[3:05] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:06] Speaker_00:** For Username, select LKA.

**[3:12] Speaker_00:** For the source username in that dropdown?

**[3:16] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'm looking.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:17] Speaker_00:** LKA.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** I see it.
