 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. How are you doing? I am well. Kent, how are you? I'm good. Thank you. Okay. Thanks for joining me today. And I don't have my camera on. I'm upstairs in my very messy office because there's kids here today home from school, and it's a mess. So my background would be a disaster. So I'm going to keep my camera hidden if that's okay with you. Certainly. name. Yeah, so I wanted to give you a quick call, kind of introduce myself, talk with you a little bit about PC Recruiter. I understand you're a new dimensional search office, and are you part of their September class? I'm going to be October, actually. October, okay, and what date is that happening? I haven't run into that one yet. Sixth, October 6th. Perfect, perfect, okay. So what I was going to do today, answer any questions you might have about PC Recruiter. Have you seen it? Do you know it? Was there any initial questions you had about it out of the gate? I've seen several videos and a demonstration of it. Not really. I think I kind of get what's up. I've dealt with the CRM before for manufacturing purposes and for companies I've worked for. So I have an idea of what a CRM generally does and then obviously what's more specific to recruiting in this. So I don't think I have any necessarily technical questions related to it. Okay, perfect, perfect. Yeah, and they do a really good job of showing you everything and kind of what it does. And what they've also done, they've developed a training program that goes hand-in-hand with PC Recruiter. So you actually would have a couple to a few sessions with your trainer here at Main Sequence. Main Sequence is the company that designs and sells PC Recruiter. before your training in October. And then they would do some training, kind of piggybacking off of what our team covers with you. And then they would hand you back over to PC Recruiter. And it kind of goes back and forth, playing off of each other. So we would be more database-heavy usage setup. They would be more recruiting in general and stuff like that. So it really plays off quite well. And I would need today, to get everything kicked off, I would need to collect your company name and address. And then I can email you over the paperwork to review. That contains all the details of the system. It contains the pricing, obviously, $750 is the setup. That includes all the setup, a consultation to get that up and running, 10 hours training, all of that. And then are you just one user? Yes. Perfect. Okay, most people are. And then it's $50 per user per month. You can add or drop users any time you wish. So $800 is the initial payment to get it set up. Go ahead. So just FYI, I ran into a snag literally today, or actually yesterday. You mentioned my company name and everything like that. In some discussions that I've had with some people, I set up my company name thinking that, hey, I'm going to be good. I know my DBA, or I didn't at the time when I set it up to do my, it's called a ROB. So I was doing a rollover of my retirement account to fund this and stuff like that. so I just selected my name to be Kimmelberry Inc. Well after having some discussions they're like oh you should not have your name in the company name. I was like well I'm going to have a DBA. I'm going to be operating as hybrid search group and they're like yeah but just for liability purposes. So as of like the last couple hours I'm like in the process of like filing an amendment for that change is it are you fine with just having my DBA which is clear I've already checked it. It's going to be fine or do you need to know my actual corporate name? DBA is fine. I've done it with many people's DBAs or some people. I even had one gentleman in the last class that just licensed it in his name because he didn't yet even have a company name or a DBA yet, so he just did it in his name. So DBA is fine or just kind of either or. That is all fine. Okay, okay. Because, yeah, I'm also the other – at the same time, with this, I was going to go set up my this all kind of came up because I was going to go set up my business checking account. I started that yesterday. I needed more documents and then I contacted my coach with dimensional search mentioned a couple things and she was like, oh, you got to change your business name and whatever. So I said, okay. So that said, I don't even have the funding in my corporate checking account because I couldn't open it and stuff like that. Relatively, I would like to wait and pay out of that rather than continue to pay out of my pocket for these tools and everything like that. So I guess my real question that I have to you now is like, would it make sense to touch base again in two weeks or something when I may have that funding actually in h...
