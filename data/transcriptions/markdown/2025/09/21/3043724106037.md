## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Rob Peskin calling. How are you? Good. How are you? I'm good. I think you helped me set up our contract staffing, I believe, right? Didn't you help me with setting that up in the system? Did you have like an hour training? Possibly, yeah. The timesheets and stuff, that sounds familiar. Yep. Yep, exactly. Yeah. So everything's working perfectly so far. I might have done something stupid. Okay. I might have put the wrong date. Like everything has been approved. It's been going out. The automated emails have been going out to the approvers. No problem there. I was wondering if I could just share my screen with you. We could probably figure this out in five, 10 minutes. Sure. Just go to, in a new tab in your browser. Yeah. Open up RingCentral. If you have the app, open up the app, or you can just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Got it. Okay. And I have a meeting ID whenever you are ready to join. Go in a meeting. Okay. Perfect. I'm ready. All right. That's 963-976-876. Perfect. All right. If it asks about joining with audio, you can just kind of mute that at the bottom left, and then click the blue share button and select your entire screen at the top. You're good. Perfect. I can see that. All right. So, yeah, let's jump back into the PCR tab. Can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me all right? Yeah, perfect. Okay. So, I'm going to our contractor. She's on assignment. I think I might have put her in the wrong week somehow I was trying to get her to let me just see something here if I go to hours so she started like on a Thursday and finished last week Okay. So this was 39 and a half hours. It was approved. If I go to hours, how do I do the full timesheet? There was another like... So if you click on the word timesheet next to Kimberly's name or to the left of her name, that'll open up the timesheets where you either have the current or the history to choose from. So that's the current week's timesheet. You can edit that or you can go to the history and see previous timesheets. And then, yeah, you can edit either of those. So here is where I think the problem is. So this is fine. It was 48.775 hours. And the period ending, S1ONSC, see. Because that's really ending this week, and I think it went in the wrong week. Okay, so hours. Right. So yeah, so she hasn't put in any of her hours yet for this week? Is that what I'm saying? Yeah, so it's only been yeah, up to Fridays when she's entered. from the first. Got it. So until she does that, then we won't have that in there. Okay. You can always go to the placement and put an end date in there on the placement record so that it shuts off their ability to clock in hours past their end date. The thing with this one is that it's a temp to perm, so I don't want to do that. I kind of want to leave it open-ended. But I get what you're saying. Because it's not like a 60-day or 90-day. It could be 180 days, and then they decide to hire her full-time, and then we're getting the hourly, and then there's a conversion fee on top of it. Oh, I see. Okay. I mean, in a perfect world, she's a contractor for like six months, and then they want to hire her full-time. That would be the most lucrative. So that's why we kept it open-ended. I just wanted to see because it went in. It's showing this pay period because it's biweekly. Is that why? Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right. So let me just go back real quick. So how did I do that? So I went in. I went in and clicked here. I went to, what did I do? Hours. What did I do? How did I get to that time? So we could go, actually go back to your main PCR tab at the top. I'll show you kind of that. So I would usually just go to contract in the main menu up at the top. Awesome. And then go to hours, that tab there, and choose your week. And then hit search at the top right with the little magnifying, yep. And then that'll list everybody who has a timesheet. If you just wanna click on the word timesheet next to Kimberly's name, in the bottom frame it'll show you the timesheet and you could switch over to the history want older timesheets as well. Got it. So that's the only way to see the full hours. Okay. And then again, as far as like active timesheet and seeing what she's filled out, how did I get to that? You could just go to the little action drop down to the left and then edit and then it brings up this page where you can look through hours and those details. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Okay. All right. So, but this, there's no way to get hours on this page from all of our hours. It's just through that one pay period. these three? Right, yeah. It's time sheet by time sheet with those pay period. Got it. Okay, cool. That's fine. Okay, I got it now. Thank you. Appreciate it. Yeah, no problem. Reach out if you need anything else. I appreciate it. Thanks, Garrett. Thanks....
