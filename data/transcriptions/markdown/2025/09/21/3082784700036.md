## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, we are having an issue with our pipeline. We logged in today and it looks like it's missing. When it goes to placement, it's just showing like a sample position in our like normal, ours is called enrollment position isn't in here. Yeah, let me take a look. Which company are you with? American Academy of Aesthetics. All right. You're saying there's just like you're not seeing a specific position in there? Yeah, it was recently viewed and then like recently modified and our only really options and it's saying like sample client or sample position old pipeline simple position. But our position of enrollment like they don't see it in here to look at our pipeline yeah let me take a look here so it looks like that position was deleted yesterday by the admin username at 4.30 p.m. So, how, is there a way to get that back or see, like, how that got deleted? So, the only way we can see how it got deleted is, like, by which username. To get it back, you can go to... How do you even delete? What's that? I don't even know how to, like, how would one delete it? So if you're in a position and you're in the options menu of that position, there is a delete option. Interesting. Okay. So you would go to system. Wait, sorry, from what page? Just like in your main navigation menu. Oh, okay. So you'd go to system. And then data management. I'm sorry, I'm not even seeing system. Is that, I see like name, company, position. Yeah, it would be in that same bar. If you're not seeing it pinned, you can click on the options menu that's next to those icons and you'll see system. So we're on the PCR, like, nine, I guess, or the purple one. Is that the right one? Yeah, you're in nine. It's up at the very top of the screen. What username are you logged in as? Right now I'm under admin. Okay. so yeah if you're in PCR 9 that icon is pinned up at the very top you'll see my PCR company name position roll-ups schedule reports activities and then you'll see system okay maybe another one then because I just see like report analytics and then we respond to like settings and support we usually go up and up on this one I don't know if it's a minor a but it's the one with like a purple okay yeah that's the newer one so down at the very bottom you'll see like where it says like ad there'll be a gear icon there for settings okay so you'll click that gear and then you'll go into data management and then recycling bin and you'll see that second one down is that position enrollment and you'll just hit restore. Awesome. We almost got a hard at that. I don't know. Yeah, I know. Me too. Okay. It's restoring. Is there a way to like enable it where it can't be deleted? No. Only just like permissions for a username controls that. Okay. So the report completed. I'm going to put that up here. Here it is. Okay. So just so I know, if I, like the only thing I can see at the end is if I, under actions, if I click the three dots, it says delete record. Is that the only way to delete it? You could delete it there, or if it was, like, on a roll-up list, you can delete things from a roll-up list. But, yeah, that's how you would delete a record. Okay. Just to make sure we don't accidentally do that again. Okay, well, you saved the day. I'm more than happy to help. Do we have any more questions while we have a minute left? Yeah, I have one question. So, like, you're saying user, like, so am I able, like, Yesterday, I met the same managing a team of people underneath, right? I don't necessarily want them to be able to, like we're saying, be able to delete an entire thing of records, right? Is there a way to set up like a username for them that is underneath? So each user in the database, like you pay like per seat? Right. For PC Recruiter. So there's no way to set it up like underneath you, like you can't really like structure like that. It would just be like each person would have their own individual username. But then you could set the security per user. Right, and then we pay per one of those. It's what you're saying. Yeah, so right now you pay for one user. So if you wanted other people to be able to log in under their own username and have different securities than that username that you're using, it would have to be an additional user seat. Right. So y'all don't get it where there's like teams, like when I sold insurance. No, there's no teams. Gotcha. Does an admin assign certain pipelines to certain users? What was that? Can the admin assign certain candidates or certain pipelines or certain rollups to the other users? Only if they're separate users. Right. Okay. But yeah, you can assign a username to a position, to a rollup, to a name record. Okay. Okay. That makes sense. alrighty well if you need anything else just let us know thank you so much yep have a great day...
