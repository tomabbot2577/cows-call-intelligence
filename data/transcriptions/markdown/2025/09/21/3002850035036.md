## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hey, McKenzie. How are you doing? This is Brian Binke with the Birmingham Group. All right. How's it going? It's going okay, but I think I have an issue with someone that just left our company. You can probably help me out on it. What I'd like you to do, I want you to reproduce what I have. and it's going to be by going into activities on our system. Okay, let me pull it up. I need to know the – oh, you did say Brian B. with Birmingham Group. Sorry, let me pull it up. Let me pull it up. I didn't catch the spelling of the last name. B-I-N-K-E. Okay, great. Thank you. Birmingham group, okay. I'm going to the URL here. There is a bunch of databases in the dropdown. Which one are you logging into? MR Birmingham. MR Birmingham, okay. And the username that you use? JV, and let me give you the date range. Oh, sorry. So this is good. What is your username, Brian? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you want hers. B-E-B. Or just, yeah, any username, I guess. B-E-B. Okay. Log in and go to activities. The activity search, right? Yeah, we want name activity search. Name activity search. Great. Okay. Activities, name. Okay, I'm looking at the activity search. Let's go to, let's do start date 6-22. So, you know, kind of the last week of last month. Yeah. 25 through today. Okay. All right. All right. All right. Anything else? Just a JV is the. Username. Username. Okay. And it sure looks like she was on vacation and then she quit, but it looks like there's been a lot of activity. Which kind of concerns me. 51,000 records, bulk email records, a lot of them. Yeah, and then from what I understand, there's a bunch of roll-up lists that were made and deleted. Bulk email, bulk email, bulk email. So I'm trying to actually... I put at least a lot of these... I put all these names on a roll-up list, which came out to 50,827 names. I don't know if that's going to be helpful, but I'm trying to turn it into a CSV, but I have a feeling that I'm blowing up your system trying to do it because it's just spinning in circles. It's probably so big you can't even do it. Maybe. That's probably part of it. I'm going to see how many of these are just bulk email. How many are bulk email? And I would like to see what aren't bulk email. Oh, wow. That's it? Well, I just, what I did is I just took that activity, turned it into, you know, a name roll-up list, and it came out with 50,827 names. Yeah, that makes sense. There's 51,000 activities, right? Trying to investigate what's happening here, I'd have to spend some time looking at this. So what we'd have to do, though, apparently, though, she had a bunch of roll-up lists that are deleted now. So we want to see what's been deleted from that time through today, which we keep backups, don't we? Yes. We have a system where we can backup a database to any point in time in the last 30 days. perfect we caught it good because i need to see what i'd like to do is see what she's what she downloaded what she sent out and the you know when she deleted everything because i think there's a lot of forensic in here because there's no way somebody on vacation should have that much activity should they I mean I don't think so uh what was the dates JV was on vacation uh what was it all last week and I think a couple days a week before so like Monday through Friday so like uh 23rd through 27th yeah but I noticed a lot of the but she didn't have to come back to work She said that she quit on the 30th. What day was it? So she sent a resignation letter on Monday. What day was Monday? That was the 30th, yep. Okay. So at about probably, I don't know, two in the afternoon, we turned her off. I have a feeling that you know she spent like all those days well we could tell when she did it because if we wanted to go through a thousand pages because they're all dated but there's so much shit there yeah there is I'm going to click through the pages to see if I can get to like what because a lot of them are bulk email about a thousand of them are bulk email activities um who would she yeah i want to can it show i want to know where they went to um it's in the because she deleted the i think she deleted the roll-ups oh you could just search for the um the time frame and then her name and then like the bulk email activity you can find those specific names and those are the names she would Yeah, I'm wondering how she did it. Because I have a feeling she went into business with somebody that was with us. Maybe. I'm not sure. Well, why else would this happen? Unless she did it on her own self. So how would I do what you just said? I'm just curious what was in that bulk email. Well, it would show you where that bulk email went, right? How about if she deleted the emails? I mean, how about if she deleted the roll-up list? I think you can restore roll-up lists from the recycling bin. So how do we do that? Let me check. Or do you have to do it? I'd rather you do tha...
