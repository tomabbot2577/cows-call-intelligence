 Hello? Hi, is Bob Levin available? Who's calling? This is Jim with PC Recruiter. Hold on. Bob? Bob? Jim with PC Recruiter? Jim with PC Recruiter? Hey, Jim, how are you? I'm well. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Thank you for getting back to me. You know what it was? You know when you log on, sometimes you get the messages on the first screen? You know, updates, this and that. There was something related to AI in the most recent update, and I didn't know if that was something I needed to sign up for or if it just happened with the product or how to read up on it, etc. So that's what it was related to, my message. It is something we actually have given a free trial of the AI suite to everyone all summer. So you should be able to go in and use the AI info if you want to take a look at it. What is it? AI, it's like some content generation there's a little AI search in there some different things that helps generate like candidate summaries, job descriptions, emails and the like so how do I access it? because I haven't done anything well, they're actually already there so it's already in there I can email you kind of a little blurb that has a little bit about each piece how to get to it and what it does if you want perfect, that's exactly what I'm looking for that would be great I'll send it on over That way I can check it out. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. My pleasure, sir. Take care. Have a good afternoon. Bye. You too....
