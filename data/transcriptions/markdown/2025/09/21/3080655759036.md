## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garriott. How may I help you? Hi, this is Stacey calling from Conexa Search Group. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Good. Okay. Calling about PCRM. We're, you know, connected on that, but I'm having a couple of issues with it. so I put it as a postmark on my you know toolbar or whatever and well the first issue is it's not loading okay oh you mean like a bookmark yeah gotcha okay let me try to log in yeah connect to connect to search group dot pc recruiter Okay, yeah, I just went to it. It's loading on my computer, so it might be – let's check your web address. Do you have connexussearchgroup.pcrecruiter.net slash PCR slash app? Slash app slash home. Slash home, okay. Let's try this. I'm going to email you another web address and see if that helps at all. Let me see. Because regular PCR works. I don't know what else to call it. Regular PCR. Right. That works just fine. I'm like, I have no idea. Okay. This helps. Okay. I just sent that over to your email address, Stacey at connectfusearch.com. Okay. See if that works any better. If not, we can, I'll give you the steps to clear cache. That might help as well. I know how to clear cache and I absolutely hate it because it screws everything else up. So. Oh, websites and everything that I have to, yeah. Like, you know. Okay. I can show you probably a specific way to clear cache that only affects the website you're on. So we could walk through this. Oh, now it's loading. Now it's loading. All right. So you have connectsasearchgroup.net, blah, blah, blah. You have question UID equals blah, blah, blah. But when I click on login, it took me to the login. Okay. Okay, good. Weird. Okay. Okay. So that tells me, what does that tell me? That tells me, yeah. I would bookmark, yeah, I would bookmark this link instead. I think the home appears at the end when you're already logged in. Let me check that. Yeah, that's when you're already logged in. So it might be trying to get you to a spot where you're not logged in yet and it's having trouble. So I would use the web address that I sent you, and that should work a little bit better. Okay. All right. The second thing is, so the reason I was calling is, so on the new PCRM, you have this deals, you know, and we're going to try to use that for business development type stuff, okay? Okay. Now, so on Friday, you know, I was introducing it to one of my recruiters, and he didn't have access. It says you don't have access. I sent him the link. He logged in. You don't have access. Okay. So I went to the settings, went to his user, and I, you know, went to my users. Let's go into there now. His name is Justin. and then I go to security, and then I went to deals, and it says records. I put them as all notes, full permission, activities, add, save, attachments, full permission. And then he still couldn't log into the deals. Like if he clicks on it, it still gives him the same error message. So, yeah. Let me try. Okay. I'm going to log in as Justin and see if I'm seeing the same issue here. Yeah, so that's what I'm doing on a different tab right now. And then I go to deals workflow. I'm seeing that. Unfortunately, you don't have access. Okay. So how do I correct that? Let me take a look here. I'm going to just message my team. I haven't been really trained too much on deals, so let me just check with my team real quick here. No, that's fine. Yeah, I reached out to Nick, and I didn't get a response. When I tried to call him this morning, I was like, I don't know what his hours are. Yeah, his hours kind of fluctuate a little bit. Let's see. Okay. And you know what I'm going to send them a screenshot of how you have those set up those User permissions because I would have guessed that that's exactly what you needed to do Right, they might know better here which is odd. So if I go into mine, right? Now I'm going to really trip you up. If I go into mine, you go into deals, it says records, no access, notes, no permission, activities, no permission, attachments, no permission. Whoa, and you can still get to it. Whoa, and I can get to it. I'm not sure. Let me even see if there's something in the learning center, maybe. I don't think there's even a Learning Center article on it while I wait to see what my team says. Nothing. Okay. I can check one other place, too. The only other thing I can think of is that deals is only for admin users. It could possibly. That's what it's sounding like, but it shouldn't. I don't see why it should be set up like that. It might be that they need to adjust that on our end in the program, that only admins can access it. There are some other options for a system administrator at the top of those permissions, like limited admin or instead of going full permission. I wonder if those would help. Yeah. Okay. So if I do, so I'm going to do limited admin. I'm going to hit save. And then I'll log in here as Justin again. Justin W. And I'll go to... Yeah, same thin...
