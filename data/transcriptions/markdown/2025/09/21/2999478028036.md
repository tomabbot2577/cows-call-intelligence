## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Barry. Hey, Barry. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm good, Jim. I wanted to give a call and get your email on Friday, and they are refunding back that payment that went for NIT for next month. Okay. I think we're ready to cancel it, right? Yeah, I believe Scott was going to talk to you. I don't know. Was it the end of this week or whatever? But I'm good. I'm not on the NIT database anymore. I'll make sure he's not. I don't think he is because I talked with him, and I told him the 30th was our target, so he said he should be done by then. Perfect. I'll put in the ticket. You still use the NITBuilds email address, right? Correct. But I also have a new one, the Cornerstone. I don't know if you have that one also. Oh, what is it? Let me change it there. Sure. And it's, what is it? It's Barry at nowcornerstone.com. So nowcornerstone.com. Yeah. Okay, perfect. So I will go ahead because I need to have an email that the cancellation ticket is going to go under. I'll put it under your old NIT builds email, which is still working. So that'll come through the cancellation for that. They're going to credit it back. And then I'll update you to Barry at now cornerstone.com in here. At now cornerstone. Thank you so much. All right. You've been very welcome. Sure, sure. Let me know if there's anything else you need. Thank you. Thank you so much. Take care. Bye. Bye bye....
