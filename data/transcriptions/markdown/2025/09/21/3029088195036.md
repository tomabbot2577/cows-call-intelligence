## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Bonnie. Hi, Bonnie. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hi. He's your recruiter. I am so sorry. I think I might have overlooked a voicemail from you, and I don't think you got a call back. I did not, but that's okay. I apologize for that. That's okay. I'm glad you called. What I am struggling with is being able to enter current employment under the names of my candidates. Okay. Are you referring to the history section? So I have my database set up under the candidates' names. I have name, address, contact info, education, salary, and then current employment. But when I go under current employment, it just says default for candidate. Oh, okay. And I'm not able to put their current employer in there. Okay. So what it sounds like to me is that you might – who set that up for you? Do you remember? I don't remember. Okay. Okay. so what it sounds like is you have um the person in the default company and that is basically just a read only of what company record they are in so you would need to change so it's not like a field that you can just type in it's actually the record that they're associated with um is that how you intended it to be? No. Okay. So let me see. Where do you have that? Okay. Let me go in. What is your username? It's executiveag. Oh, your username. It looks like it's just Bonnie, right? Okay. Yeah. Yeah, it is Bonnie. All right, let me see what's in your name layout. Okay, so the current employment, that is all related to what company record they're in. So, for example, if you look at Chris Thompson, right next to his name, the company record that he's associated with is your default company. Now, how did you bring this person in? Was it through portal or capture? I'm sorry, capture, I mean. Capture, PC Capture. So it sounds like to me you might have your PCR capture set where it puts them into the default and instead of trying to get a company record for them. So if you click directly on your PCR capture extension at the top right of your browser, let me know when you see that. It's the purple, green, blue option. Okay. Okay. it pops up a menu like what sites we would be using it on but see at the bottom right where it says capture to default company uh yes okay is that blue like it's on or gray and over to the left as if it's off it's on okay if you turn that off what that'll do is when you're using capture it'll try based on their profile try to create a company record or if it finds a match you would hover on the possible match and then select the check box so that they go into the existing record instead of creating as new so these people because some people don't want like companies just because somebody worked there so this would be creating the way you had it before is it's just putting everybody into the default which is basically a fake company record okay so i i manually enter a lot of people and it won't let me enter a company name right because that's related to a record it's not just a free type field it's actually the record that they're in okay like if you go to name and go to search as an example. Okay. Without any criteria, you'll notice every name is in a company record. So when you don't know what company they work for or really care, you would just add the, you would, or if you don't select, let's say if you're parsing a resume, they would just go into the default company. So the default company is really a company record with a fake name that just kind of, so we can't have any orphaned records. Everybody must be in a company. So that's just kind of like a little catch-all so we don't have any orphaned name records. Okay. So you can't just put somebody into the default. What would be the benefit of doing that? Because it's a database requirement. So some people, they don't want to create company records just because somebody worked there. So they would just put somebody into the default. I see. So all of these fields were set for employment. So if I don't know their company? Yeah, so if you didn't know the company, then you would add them to the default. Otherwise, you would need to have a company record. So you can either put the name of their company or you put default for candidates? Well, if you are parsing a resume, you could either pick an existing company record. if you don't do that then it would just go into the default company because not all of our customers want like you know John Smith works for XYZ company if you're never going to call that person you just put them into the default okay the current employment section it's not stuff that you're free typing it's really carrying over from the company oh so I can't Even if I make this change, I can't enter the name of their company. You would have to have a record for it. And then what you do, let's say Chris Thompson, let me find the name of one of your companies. Let's say Chris Thompson worked for XYZ company. Right now, he's in the default. If you're on his name record, there's a change co...
