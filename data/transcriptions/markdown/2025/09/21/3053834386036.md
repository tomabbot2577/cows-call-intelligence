## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon. This is Jim. Yes. Is this Mr. Lombardo? This is. Oh, good. This is Art Amberg. I missed your call the other day. Yeah. I wanted to see if you were looking to put your account on hold. Yeah, I think so. You thought somebody had sent me something, but I didn't. I don't recall getting anything. Let me go in here. Yeah. So what we can do is we can put that account on hold. It suspends the account essentially so you can't access it, but you only pay, I think it's normally 20 bucks a month, just maintenance to keep it kind of in a lukewarm status. but Robin and I spoke a month ago or so and decided we could do it for 10 per month for you to put that on hold if you'd like and then you can keep it on hold as long as you need until you decide if you're going to continue you where you can re-enable it just start paying your normal rate again or you can cancel it at that time if that's what you decide to do and none of the data it'll be lost or anything. The data's not lost? Yep. We just turn it right back on and you pick up right where you left off. Yeah, I'd like to do that. $10. How do I do that? Well, what I will do is I will put in a ticket for Robin. There might even be one in that I can update for her and then she will send you a little form to fill out. Then she'll just switch your billing, pick a date when you're going to make it into that form, into that on-hold status, and she'll go ahead and proceed through it with you. Okay. Okay. Perfect. I will put the ticket in and get everything progressing to make that happen. Okay. Very good. Thank you. All right. Thank you, sir. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. She might have sent it to an old – if she sent an email, she might have sent it to an old email because I have changed that. So maybe we should upgrade that. Absolutely. What's the best email for you? It's now aamberg, two A's, A-A-M-B-E-R-G. 4545 at gmail.com Yes, she had aamburg at acgjobs.com That's no longer good? Yeah, that's an old one. Perfect. I'll update the email address in here and perfect. Okay, we'll correspond with that new one. Okay, thank you. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Bye....
