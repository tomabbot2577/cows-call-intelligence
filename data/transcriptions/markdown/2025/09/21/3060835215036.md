## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Just had a very basic PCR question. We worked with you guys for quite a while and then moved one of our groups to a different platform, and now we're back on PCR. Yeah. I was just hoping you could remind me how to get to, like, the submittal reporting area. I think it's in reports or analytics. yeah which what's your username for the database oh that's a good question so I'm logged in work I think it's just J Randall all capitals just the letter J and then Randall it's R a nd a ll It wasn't that. What's your company? My username? Yeah, Avian Search Partners, A-V-I-A-N, and then space search, and then space partners. Oh, hold on. Give me two seconds. I forgot my computer restarted. Just need to log back into something real quick. Okay. Okay. Just take two seconds here. Amazing what you forget in a couple years. Yep. There we go. I'm in here. So are you just looking for, like, to find everybody that's been submitted? Yeah, just so we can track it weekly. We used to have all this kind of stuff set up and all that, and then moved to a different ATS, and then we just moved, like, a very small group back onto PCR. And I just want to, you know, select the date range and just see how many, you know, candidates we got submitted. And then are you using like that RA submit step? Yeah, I think we just like, you know, click and drag somebody basically to like the, you know, submittal sequence. I think that's how we're all set up. Let me take a look here. because in analytics you do have like pipeline analytics set up but i'm not seeing anybody in like a submitted yeah because we haven't really been using it yet as far as logging it but i want to start logging it you know next week go forward gotcha gotcha so yeah there is in if you go up to analytics Okay. And then in the metrics section, you'll see one called pipeline. Okay. And then in there, you'll see you can select a date range up in the top right. Okay. Just a little calendar picker. And it'll break it down like per pipeline step for you. Perfect. Okay. good that's all I was looking for and then you can also do like where it says teams up at the top how one's selected you can also break that down just by like per user or all users instead of a team filter okay awesome yeah so that's where you can track all of that okay perfect yeah that's all I was looking for man that's to be all set then. Alrighty. Well, if you need anything else, just let us know. What are you guys doing out there in the space? Is volume down quite a bit across the board, or are you just like all customer support? From what I've been hearing from everybody, it's just tough right now. Everybody that has a job isn't looking to go for a new one. Just with the economy being so shaky, especially We have a lot of people that, like anything other than just basic recruiting, like if they're like power sports recruiting, anything that's like disposable income industries that they're recruiting for, those ones are hurting. Right. Yep. Perfect. Well, yeah, no, appreciate the help. yeah not a problem if you need anything else just let us know all right thanks a lot man have a good rest of the week you too bye yeah bye...
