## 📝 Summary

This conversation appears to be a recording of a phone call between two individuals, likely Jim and the speaker. The topic of discussion is PCRM (PC Recruiter Modern), a software product that has been updated from its predecessor, PCR9.

The speaker asks Jim about the differences between PCRM and PCR9, and Jim explains that PCRM is essentially an enhancement to PCR9 with a more modern look and feel. However, it's mentioned that there are still users on PCR8 and earlier versions, which have been shut down.

Jim also mentions that there are two products being supported now: PCRM and PCR9, but the ultimate goal is to transition everyone to PCRM eventually. The adoption rate of PCRM is low, with most customers still using PCR9 or just starting to use PCRM.

The speaker expresses interest in providing feedback on PCRM and asks if they can be sent a link to explore it further. They also mention that Crelate is a step more expensive than PCRM but acknowledges that it's a different product.

Overall, the conversation seems to be an informal discussion between two individuals exploring the updates and changes made to PCRM compared to its predecessor, PCR9.
