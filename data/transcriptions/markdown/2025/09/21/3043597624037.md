## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. I wanted to reach out. I had just noticed starting this morning, just not able to see the PCR caption icon, say, through LinkedIn for, say, a new profile, you know, ad profile or update a profile for someone that's already in the system. So I tried to do a couple things on my end and just thought I'd reach out and see if you guys might be able to help with that. Yeah, so we did run an update this morning on the capture tool. Okay. Do you leave your computer on overnight? Have you done, like, a restart of the computer? You know, I don't believe I have. No, I don't. It hasn't been restarted since yesterday. Okay. So I would recommend just giving your computer a quick restart. Okay. So that way everything can update itself. I apologize because I was going to do that this morning too. That was like the last thing on the checklist and I just totally spaced on it. So I should have given that a try first. Oh, not a problem. Yeah. So what can happen is because we pushed that update, if there's some stuff stuck in your browser, it may just need a quick restart to clear all that up. But I would say go ahead and give it a quick restart. if that doesn't do the trick for you give us a call back we can hop on our screen share and kind of do some advanced troubleshooting that's probably that's the first thing we should do there to kind of get everything back on the same page yeah yeah working on the restart now and hopefully i won't have to uh reach back out but if it isn't working after uh this deal i'll circle back but i appreciate it tyler yep not a problem you have yourself a great day You too. Thank you. Bye. Bye....
