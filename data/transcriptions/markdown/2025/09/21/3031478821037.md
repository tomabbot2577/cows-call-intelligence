## 💬 Full Transcript

 This call is being recorded. Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hello, this is Robin at Main Sequence. We received a call from someone named Karen. Yep, I was actually on the line earlier vaping. Yeah, thank you so much for calling and getting me back. I actually need help with the sequence that I'm currently creating, and I really don't know what is the error. Okay. What is your last name and your company? Oh, yeah. So my company name is Targeted Recruiting Group. My last name is Karen Camu, sorry, C-A-M-U. That's my last name. Okay. And what is your PCR username? Karen and then T-A-M-U. And what is the sequence that you're working on? Is it already created or are you working on the template? It's a template. But later I have questions with the sequence that I currently have. So the name of the template that I'm creating is bd-25mkt sequence. Now, when I'm checking for problems, it gives me an error that says, error, step send email in branch one has only the condition to opt out and subscribe without any other validating conditions. Yeah there's a couple things I'm seeing wrong. Let's first okay when you go to templates and where it says BD-25 market sequence click on that and select edit template name. Okay so one thing that you're going to need is under your rate limiter where you're going to have to pick who's sending it and then their email alias. That's the best one thing this does not have yet. Okay, I'll give me one second. Let me just go back here. So for the rate limiter, if I got it right, I use it because I want only 99 emails will be sent out per day and I'm on the right track with that. Yeah, well depending on who your mail server is, 99 might even get you past hitting some per hour restriction you never know with the mail servers I would maybe just kind of maybe just do like 10 per hour or 20 per hour just only have it run certain times though it kind of just depends I see so just in that hour would be fine okay hold on I'm still waiting for it to give me that option so you'd really just prefer to do it just for hour rather than yeah that's probably safer because if you hit where it's too many for the hour or even like i mean if you have like a delay they might have some space it out like if you just want to do like 10 per hour you know you do something like that okay that way you don't hit any restrictions with that especially because but it looks like you have Office 365, and you also have a SendGrid. Yeah. So which one would you be using? So I'm sending it through SendGrid. Okay. Then your 99 per day is fine. Okay. And then, sorry, what should I use here? Like email user? I could put email user here? You have to pick who the user is and then their email alias. So that would be like your Office 365 or your SendGrid. So I have a question here because I'm just doing this sequence for Todd. So is it safe to say that... So then you'd probably put his... Yeah, I would pick his username then. Okay. And then his email is... Okay. Got it. I didn't see this. Because if you... I'm not using rate limiter. It's not asking if you use this bulk email. So this is the... I'm not using this bulk email. I'm not using rate limiter it's not asking if you use this bulk email so this is going to be a setup when you are using this rate limiter well you got to pick it there to define what the pace is but then in the step itself you have to have one there too okay so let me go ahead and save this And still loading. Who are you naming? Robin. Robin, okay. Give me one second. Robin. Uh, still loading. I think still need to wait for a few. Still saving. Is this usually how long is it for sequence? I haven't really looked at your sequence yet. Oh, I mean, yeah, there we go. Now I'm in the sequence. Okay, have you saved it? I'm in Branch 1. Yep, I've already saved it. And now I'm inside Jump It and I'm in Branch 1. All right. So if someone else replied. I'm still having that thing. Oh, you have a reply and nothing happening. You have either one of those, both of those going to Branch 2, which is going to really be the same thing. So I don't understand the logic there. Oh, I see. So should I remove this reply? Yeah, if you just want them where if they opt out, they're done. But if nothing happens, they just go to Branch 2 and it just tries them again in six days. I believe you don't need to reply to. Okay. Because it's just going to send them another email. otherwise as soon as they reply they're going to another get immediately get another email step two or branch two i don't even know what i'm seeing here that if you even need all these branches you could just gun down in a step and seen it in one place yeah so the thing here in this other branches is it possible but yeah so still there's an error here so what i what we want to do is to create like a sequence where we still have to edit per branch because we are not ready yet with our form letters. So I think that's possible, right? Well, as long as you h...
