## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Gabriel from Survival Systems. How are you doing this afternoon? Good. How are you? Fair to middling, but improving by the moment. Good. I'm having a problem where everybody in my office is complaining that PCR is slow. Now, I got like four emails today and two yesterday. I'm unfortunately not there to prove it, but I did go on to, like, my remote desktop connection to my server and check everything. We're running at full. I mean, we have almost a gigabit of bandwidth, okay? And everything is good. Every other website pops up instantly. But PCR is just, like, lagging on the load. And, you know, we've been customers for several years. but it's particularly bad now to a point where it's like actually timing out in between page loads and we're talking about like moving from candidate to candidate adding a record anything it's just like brutally sluggish gotcha um so i just logged into your database on my end and everything's zipping around pretty quickly so it's not something on our servers it seems to be specific to the computers or the office. Have you tried restarting the router at all? Yeah, no, that's definitely not the problem because all other websites are super fast. And also, like, are you in Ohio right now? Yes. And are the servers in Ohio? Yes. Okay. So, in fact, you're literally sitting right next to the computer that our database is on, but we are 3,000 miles away. Do you think that might be a problem? Is there any kind of like route? Can we do a route check to us or something like that? Can we do a route check? I'm interested in doing anything to sample, but the fact that this answer will not be acceptable to my staff. Right, right. I see. Yeah, so it doesn't, yeah, I don't think it would be any difference. I'm actually not next to the servers. They're downtown in a different location, But if we're able to access the server without any lagging issues, it doesn't seem to be a server issue. Sometimes different websites load differently since this is a session-based website rather than maybe a different type of website. So restarting the router does usually help in these instances. The other thing to look at is to see if you have a web protection software turned on. So there are like virus scanning softwares that have a section or a heading in that virus scanning software for web protection specifically. We recommend turning that off. And that also helps speed up the use of session based browser searching. I mean, surfing. So using our website with web protection turned off is usually better. and then the other stuff like that i totally know what you're talking about um i i i will i will explore this i don't feel like that's the problem either but we're going to go ahead and shoot see what happens yeah so if you do have a web protection software open up those settings and see if there's a um or i'm sorry any type of virus scanning software just see if there is a web protection element that you can turn off. And I've seen other customers using extensions on their browser, like a browser extension that has web protection turned on. You would want to disable that browser extension as well to test to see if that's quicker. And then I think the only other thing I've seen causes would be usage of a VPN. So if anybody in the team is using a VPN, we would recommend not using a VPN while using PCR since it is session-based. All right. I'll look into all of these things because I'm also having a problem with one of my other – one person in the office, his PCR keeps logging out like every 10 minutes. Okay. Yeah, that could be – we usually say that when a VPN is in use. So make sure that that is not being turned on. Also, if you have too many browser tabs open at once on Google Chrome, Google will, to save memory, make some tabs inactive. And if it happens to pick PCR, that unfortunately logs you out of PCR. It makes that tab inactive. So I would recommend having, you know, maybe 12 or less tabs open. Anything above that, you're running the risk of Google Chrome making your PCR session inactive. Okay. Well, I appreciate you giving me these ideas. I'm going to try a couple of these things and see if it makes a difference. Yeah, definitely call back if you're still having issues. and we can even do a screen share with somebody, you know, at the office or something. That's what I was hoping. Yeah, because the fact is, is that, like, I did a screen share and it was brutal. It was like waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, and then the page wouldn't load and then it would load or it wouldn't. And if it didn't, it would just be like, there's been an error, PCR timeout. And I was like, what? Oh, man, I don't know what's going on here. And I checked, everything else is fine. routers running great, but we do have some foreign protection software, or excuse me, offensive content for old things, blah, blah, bl...
