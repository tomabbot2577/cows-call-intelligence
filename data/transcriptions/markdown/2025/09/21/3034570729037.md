## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Robin. Yes, hi, Robin. This is Jennifer Stanhope. I was having system issues, so I, like, logged in, opened everything back up, and now it says I've hit my number of login attempts in the PCR, which is weird because I was just logged in and just tried it once, and that was the first thing that popped up. Oh, I'll have to see here. Hold on one second. And I did change to a new password yesterday, but it worked fine earlier when I was in so I don't know what's happening okay let's see hold on one I was in the middle of us and Okay, let's see. And I'm sorry, what is your name again? BI talent search. Let's see what's going on here. I don't think it was like a... Do you happen to have anything else connected to PCR as you? Maybe that still has an old password. No. I mean, the only thing I can potentially think of, which would be really weird because it would be shut down, is I take my daughter's laptop and like I'll open it up there. But that would have been, she hasn't even been home for a week. Like you don't have like the Outlook portal added or something like that, do you? For Outlook? Yeah, there's like a PCR portal added for Outlook. Oh, I'm sure I do. And I changed all of my passwords to Outlook and everything. Okay, but I wonder if you changed the PCR portal. or the PCR password in your Outlook portal because that's still a connection. That could be logging you out. Let me see what's going on here. Okay, so it does say logged out here. Okay, so how do I log in? All right, so if you... Now, that's probably... Let me at least unlock your account. Okay, so J Stanhope, and it does have, like, different initials, so that's telling me something else is probably... your username is probably like all caps when you log in but then you have a something else logging in is you as well where it's j and then j s and then everything else is lowercase that tells me there's something else connected oh okay so that's probably what's going on let me first unlock your account okay that's that issue okay so if you open up your outlook yes and go to your peace recruiter ribbon yes okay well just as long so it's like the message it just says log down I wouldn't say it's okay so see it'll be right near that area where it says options okay click on that okay yep and does it do you have your password saved in there I mean sorta it's like a crazy long password which is probably not right. Okay, so that's what I need to fit? Yeah, put your new password into that password field. Goodness gracious, there's just like dots everywhere. Okay, let's try... I'll just start typing and see if it works. Yeah, you'll want to clear out whatever is there. Well, it's just a bunch of dots, and even when I hit delete, they're still just there. That's so weird. Okay, let me try it. What if you click in there and then, what was it, like double click and it should select everything that's showing in there and then okay wow that was like forever dot so i don't know what happened okay something yeah probably because they it probably just kind of screwed something up um okay put in your new password and then before you save it up near the top there's like a test connection okay does it say success okay make sure your save password box box is selected and while you're in there what is the version number at the top of that configuration screen what does it end in? Version 2.0.0.524. Okay so we'll probably also want to update that too and that could be so when you change your password like if you have PCR capture the Outlook portal anything connecting is you got to change it there as well otherwise you could yeah someone would still be in so that's probably what caused it there well and it caused also like i was having issues with i have call logic too and like it just wasn't like all connected i'm like what is happening i was like i'm just going to shut down restart yes if you have call logic connecting with your username and password you'll need to change it there as well okay which is all of those all of those are trying to connect your databases you So, like, if you change your password, anywhere where it's connecting is you. You've got to update it there. You knew that changing all my passwords would be such chaos. Yeah. So it could have been, like, call logic or, you know, opening an Outlook. Those would have been trying to connect. And when you hit so many, that's why you probably thought, oh, I only did it once. But it's probably other stuff taking up some of those counts. Okay. That's totally what was happening. Okay. and I need to play around and see how everything's connected. Okay. So while we're here on this one, if you save and close what you have now. Okay. I also want to make sure you update to the current version of the portal. Okay. So what you're going to want to do is go to, so once Outlook is closed, open up a new tab and type in PC Recruiter Downloads. Oh, like close all of Outlook? Yeah, just, yeah, close Outlook. Okay. I wa...
