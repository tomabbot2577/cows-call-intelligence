## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, Join Reads with Chappell Solutions calling you back. Question, if the column name is different from the field in PCR, when I map it to the field in PCR, does it still map over, or do you have to change the column name in the Excel sheet to match? It'll map over when you're using any of those destination fields. It doesn't have to match. The only time it does have to match is if you're using a custom field slot. Then the column has to be labeled exactly so that it goes to the correct custom field or creates the custom field with the exact terminology you want. Got it. Too much. Cool. Thank you. Appreciate it. No problem. Reach out if you have any other questions. Bye. Thanks. Bye....
