## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon. This is Jim. Jim, good day. It's Ben Williams. Hey, Ben. How are you? Good, good. Bear with me a little bit if you don't mind. I'm just starting my two-hour trip. Are you myself point of contact now? Is it Jim or Jim Wise? Either of us. Jim Wise is kind of transitioning out, still working here, but slowly transitioning out. So I can certainly be one to help, absolutely. Oh, so this is now like retired transition out or leaving? Yeah, he's leaving, kind of going to do his own thing. So slowly just starting early stages of that. Gotcha. Okay. So we had a – how much do you know about our account and all that stuff? So maybe we can start there. Okay, I don't know much of any. I'm just learning about it now. Okay. So we were with you guys, then we left, then we came back. We had quite a few recruiters, and then now we're back in rebuilding. We have, if you look at our database, it's ProVitas technology. but we're moving all of our talent solution stuff over to Moja Incorporated. So the first thing we need to do is we need to get the name on the database chain. Okay. And I talked to Garrett about that. And then we need to get our web link so you can hit our site. We're going through a complete web rebranding the whole thing. That's the first two things we need to do as well. Okay. We originally had five licenses. We went down to three just until we go through this. We're going through like a little, I don't know, thing. But we're probably going to end up probably somewhere in the realm of like, I don't know, 10 to 15 within the next, probably I would guess, the next, let's call it 12 to 18 months. We'll probably, maybe not quite 15, but maybe like 8 to 10. Okay. Okay. So the most important part now is why we got, you know, we got the free licenses and we're coming out of dynamic CRM or ATS. We've been using the system now for probably a couple months, maybe like six, seven, eight months. I don't even know, maybe longer than that. And we're liking the features. I'm liking the flexibility, but I need to make sure things are, you know, lined up. So I just reached out. So we purposely didn't finish our training hours. because I was going through a little bit of a, I was going to do another little shake up here. But then when I reached out to Garrett, I think we had like, I don't know, 16 or 14 hours, something like that, that we didn't use, right? So we don't need train up hours. We need set up hours. So I need things set up. So I don't, you know, and we didn't use our hours. So that's the first thing. So, like, one, I want to be able to use the time card feature. I want to be able to use the pipeline feature. And then we have a list of reports that are already in the system that we want to make sure that they work and the dashboard, right? So what I never got a good handle on is your new dashboard. It's called, what do you guys call that? Analytics? Analytics, yeah. Yeah. So that has a different, it's very different. So I guess from a salesy standpoint, I want to kind of know, like, what analytics is. We want to see things like current consultants for the person and all of that. But the mission critical is the timesheet, the pipeline, and our commission reports so we can stop double jockeying numbers. So all that being said, we're trying to figure out, okay, how do we get this all set up and go and all that stuff. I need the name to change for sure. And Garrett sent me a consulting agreement. I don't know why that is, but I don't understand the document that he sent me. Is there something I need to say that, hey, you know, we're moving over, change the name? Maybe it's a different document. I don't know. Are you aware of something different? I don't know. So I'm trying to get into your account here. So you need to change the name of the company and the database and the link and everything. Yeah, the link's not up right now. purposely primarily the company information but somebody sees when they click on a link it needs to click on the link that says you know Moja incorporated mm-hmm see so so is that like the job board piece or the website piece or the name of the database or everything? If you can change everything so it's consistent, that would be great. Okay. If you would, I want you to email me so I can get the correct spelling and look of the new name so we can get that out, so we can get everything changed. So we'll change the URL, the name of the database, get that changed and done. So that's one thing we do. I'm going to be driving for the next four or five hours, so can I just give it to you? Yeah, go for it. It's simple. It's Moja, M-O-J-A Incorporated. M-O-J-A Incorporated. Okay. It's still the same. I don't think we need to sign a new agreement because I think you're the signer. so that wouldn't change okay so let's see so yeah you're the signer yeah so we'll just change the company name in my database to should it be changed to mocha incorporated yeah that'd be great so when the new rec...
