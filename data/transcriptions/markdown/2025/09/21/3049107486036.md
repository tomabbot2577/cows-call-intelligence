## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. This is Gavin. Yeah, I had a question about my PC recruiter. I'm not sure if you can help me. But it has to do with the capture function. Yeah. So I'm logged in. I haven't used it for a little while, but I'm logged in. I'm in there. And then when I basically am trying to get, you know, names from LinkedIn into their system, like into a new job. And I'm not sure why, but I think like the capture tool, I'm not sure if it's no longer working or not on my computer. I'm not really sure what the problem is. Okay. Probably best to do a screen share. Bear with me one second. I was just finishing up an email to somebody and I just literally got a copy of something. and send it off and then I'll what I like to do is a screen share okay okay okay and I'm sorry your name is Ed Welsh, W-E-L-S-H. With Prime Talent Group? Correct, yes. Okay, all right. And is your email ed at primetalentgroup.com? Yes, it is. Okay. I'm going to send you a screen share link. Okay. For an instant meeting. So it's going to come from me. It'll come from Robin at mainsequence.net. Okay. One moment. That should be on its way. Might take a moment to get to you, though. Okay. Okay, I just got it. Just a join call? Yes, go ahead and join. And then what you don't need to do, though, or like when you are in, you don't need to join the computer audio since we're already on the phone. Okay. And you don't need to show your camera because they're going to be watching your screen anyway. Okay. Okay. I'm trying to admit you. Okay. So let's have you share your screen. So at the bottom of your meeting screen, the icon is a rectangle with an arrow in the middle. Click that. and then when that screen pops up, go over to entire screen. Okay. Yeah, I hit entire screen. But then it's not allowing me to share. It just cancels the only one I can use. Okay. Is it showing you like a preview of a screen? Yeah, it is. You might want to click on that first. Okay. Oh, here we go. Okay. And then if you can mute, or I think I can mute you because I'm just giving a little bit of interference. Let's see. Okay. Okay, I'm going to mute you. Okay. Yeah, let me see if I can mute. Yeah, I got it done for you. Okay, so this meets tab. We need to keep it open, but we're not going to use it. So what is it that you're trying to do? So let me get back to Easy Recruiter. Okay. Can you see my screen? Yes. Okay. Okay. So basically I have these projects in LinkedIn that have all the candidates for a specific job that I'm working. So I'm basically trying to get the candidates from LinkedIn into PC Recruiter. So usually I would, I'm not sure why it's so slow, but usually I would, there was like a capture tool, which is this little icon up here. Correct. Okay, let's click on that. And this screen has never come up before, so I'm not sure what this is all about. So here's one thing I would recommend. When Seward says basic mode, turn that off. Mm-hmm. Take it off? Okay. Yeah. I think you've got a lot of settings here that change. See all of these LinkedIn options? Turn all of those on. Okay. Okay. Do you ever use Indeed? No, I don't use it. Okay. I think all the LinkedIn ones have to be on, though. Okay. Now, when you capture somebody, do you like to get their company or just have them go to the default? Usually their company as well. Okay. so see where it says captured a default company let's turn that off take it off all right yep okay let's exit out of here okay let's go back and reload this page and see if we get to pop up again so if you yeah there we go and go over to somebody's name now Should we maybe go out of LinkedIn completely? It looks like it's kind of locked up there. Yeah, let's try him. So normally when I go to someone's – I don't know why this is running so slow, but normally when I go to someone's page, from what I remember, there was like a little icon thing would pop up down here that would allow me to try to capture it into PC Recruiter. Yeah, it could have been those pages being off, which is why I had you turn those off or those back on. Also, when you're in basic mode, you don't get the review screen. I think we got something here, though, too. Let's just go out of LinkedIn completely. Let's see if there's anything. Oh, here we go. Yeah, like usually there was like a – I think there was like something over here that allowed me to capture it. What if you go to public profile? on that go back to go back to here um there's actually quite a few things open here let's um what is that tab that looks like this spend it starts with gen and you also that's just the just close it out if you don't need it might help okay let's go over to your linkedin tabs again because you've got like multiple here. Can we go out of anything we don't need? Yeah, I can just, this was some video I was watching. I can get rid of that. Okay. All right. Now, sometimes, especially with LinkedIn, they like to change their URLs. Sometimes that throws things off a little bit....
