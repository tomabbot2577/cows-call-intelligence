## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good morning, this is Dave. Good morning, Dave. This is Robin Montoni with Main Sequence. Hey, Robin. I'm so sorry. We were in an internal meeting when you called. I checked your database and I'm not seeing any slowness. Are you still experiencing an issue? Let me try someone here. I'm bringing people in, LinkedIn replyers here. Let me try them real quick. So, go ahead, get him up there. So, it was capture or your database? Capture. Okay, because the database itself seems moving fine. It's pretty much, it was a little bit, the database was a little slower, but that's improved. But capture has been real slow. Okay. So, was it at the same time that the database was slow? same time and it's still going on or was I stopped waiting to hear back from you folks okay because I'm wondering if a database slowness was making the process of checking for duplicates and stuff like that to go slow too can you try a capture now and see if it's better since the database seems fine yeah let me get him out he's already up here okay click add I'm just going to go ahead and add him straight up without well I got to put some stuff in no I got to put or won't let me go forward Okay, there it goes. Normally it's finished by now, and it's still, there's three dots that sort of get big and get small. Okay, let me try to capture myself. There it went, finally. Okay. Let's see. Well, that would not be related to cash, so let me just try something here. Okay. So mine seemed fine. Connecting to my database. Can we do a screen share? Sure. Okay. Do you have RingCentral? No, I don't. I don't use it. Let me delete this one guy. I've only got one chance here. Okay. What do we need? I'm going to send you a Google Meet bear with me one second let me bring this up here and it's davidtodaysactuary.com that's the correct email yes okay Last time I came in and span our junk and I had to massage it so we could open it. Nothing yet. Have you said? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Might take a moment to get in. Who is your Internet provider? Well, now it's called a sound. Everything else is working. And I even restarted the computer to make sure it wasn't on, or at least not on my end. maybe got spam no spam no junk I've not received that Robin okay I'll send it again fuck Thank you. You still didn't get the email? No. That's really odd. What happened to 123? Wasn't that what you guys were using? I don't, yeah, I don't have that account. Okay. I think Sean was the only one that really used that I didn't do more tactical stuff, but it doesn't restrict you as much. No, it's not here. That's so strange. If I send it, I've got it in my clipboard still. Let me see. Dave at todaysactuary.com. Yes. And how do you receive your email? Like is it an Outlook or Gmail? Yes, Outlook. You could sure send me the bills. Yeah, I mean, I'm just... No, I mean, this should come right from me. I'm going to send you another. That is so strange. Let's see. There it is. But there's no link. So that was another email that I sent. Is it just like more like a test email? Okay. Yeah, here is another email. All right. So let's see. I'm going to send another one. I'm just going to send it with my link. Maybe it doesn't like my link in there. I made it safe last time you sent it because it ended up in junk. So I said always, you know, don't block this person. But still, she ended up in junk email. Okay, I'm going to send you another one. Okay, hit send receive now. Let's see if you get this other email that I tried to send you with a meeting link. Yeah. Okay. Okay, got it. Okay. Okay. I've got you up there in the center on my screen. okay all right so when I have you do you don't need to get joined with a computer audio so you can make sure that's muted we don't have any interference it is okay click share screen well it's on both screens I have LinkedIn on one side and okay so what you're going to want to do is when you click share screen go over to entire screen and then select which screen to share all right which one do you want to see um whatever has I guess the LinkedIn for now um worst case scenario we drag the other screen over we just have to kind of pick out yeah to start with okay so let's go over to LinkedIn which is your first tab gotcha okay and then let's say click to update oh she's already in there oh no that's this kid he I don't want him he didn't send me his email so we've got to do Christina okay okay where is she working let's see this career break oh she's on a career break I'm gonna use her anyway because that's all I've got I don't want her but uh we'll put it in career bank as a company.
