## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, Garrett. Hey, I have somebody asking for billing. It's a Dean Fagan at Corp Hunter. Okay. All righty. Send him over now. Hi, this is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Dean Fagan, and our account is Corp Hunter. Okay. We want to do some adjustment of our billing. How do I go about doing that? Depending on what it is, it might start with me. Let me pull up your information. Hold on one second. Okay. So you're currently licensed for three users. Okay. Let's see. Yeah, you're currently licensed for three users. What is it that you're looking to change? To drop all of the PCR mails. We just don't use them. And I didn't realize they were that much a month. Okay. For, I believe, a change like that, it might have to have like a new contract. So you don't use like the email integration for your incoming email? It doesn't, it never has really functioned in a lot. We use Gmail mostly and it doesn't populate over. So it really has no beneficial use for us. Oh, it might not just not be set up correctly. because like when i go into a client's thing and click on email a lot of times there's just not even anything in there because we're not sending it out through pcr we'll do it in email yeah what pcr mail does is like you have to have it hooked up to your mail server and then what it does is it basically kind of replicates whatever's going on in your email into PCR mail. And so that way you can write activities or you could jump to the email right from the record. So it might just be that it's not connected. You know, in over the years, we've been a PCR user for many, many years and the settings would work for a while and then something would quit working and and we'd have to go in and make changes in it. And then when Gmail updates their software, then it doesn't work with PCR. So I'm just finding we're not using it. So if I can get along without it this long, I don't need it. Okay. Basically what goes on is like, especially lately with Office 365 and Gmail, just security changes. So to change your contract, I'd have to talk to an account manager first. What is your email? I'm sorry, not your email. What is your PCR username so I can at least check what's going on? It's www. Oh, wait a minute. D Fagan forward slash corp hunter final. And I'm the admin for the account. Okay. I can only see what's going on with yours. It just needs to be reauthenticated. Especially with Gmail, they've changed a lot of securities. And that's what Gmail, IMF, okay. Well, if I can save $60 a month, I'm going to dump it. I just don't need it. Okay. 7-7-25 is the last one in there. Let's see. I'm just looking here. And you can look back and see it's been months, months, and months. Yeah, the email that you have connected is, it looks like it is advertisingheadhunter at gmail.com. That's correct. okay authenticating most recent emails are 7 8 20 25 today So the one thing that could be going on, if you are not seeing the email on the name record, if you permanently delete the email, then it's not under the email tab, but it does write an activity. It does write in activities. Yeah. Like, do you know of somebody, like an example of somebody that you emailed recently that would be in your database? Yeah, I was just looking at my partner, and I see that hers are updated. Okay. So, yeah, it'll write an activity, but what the emails tab does for you is if you still have the email sitting on your mail server, because once it downloads the PCR mail, it's basically whatever's on your mail server is also in PCR mail. So if you delete the email, then as long as it'll stay in there until it's permanently deleted, But usually Gmail deletes anything in Trash after 30 days. I believe that's like their default setting. Yeah, and we don't. We keep our, for archival purposes, we keep all of our emails in Gmail for so many years. Okay. Yeah, you should still get an activity that doesn't remove. But if you delete the email, the email no longer exists. Because when you go to the emails tab, that's basically the same as going to your Gmail account or going into PCR mail and doing a search for that person's email within your own account. So when you look at it under activities, that's what's shared with all users and that's what stays. But the emails tab is only with you and that person. So like if my partner wants to look at an email that I sent to her, she can't see it. She'll see the text under activities, but she won't be able to go to the emails tab. And the reason it's clicking the subject line is actually opening that email, meaning that there's also reply, reply all, forward, and delete. So she would see it as an activity, but not under the emails tab. Only you would see your emails with that person under the emails tab. She can see it under activities, though. Correct. Okay. All right, let me talk to my partner. and we'll decide what we're going to do. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. All right. Thank you. Bye....
