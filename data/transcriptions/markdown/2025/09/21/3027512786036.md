## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, you've reached Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. I'm Connie Rose. You will have me listed under Connected Services, I believe. I was then a Raymond, but you probably have it under Financial Improvement International. All right. How can I help you today, Connie? Well, it's a simple thing, but not so much. I'm trying to learn a lot of software at the same time, and so I make a regular call. Sometimes two or three a week, Andy, you guys. I created an email and saved it in draft yesterday. And so I found it. I found the email. I've got three different email addresses with this company, so there's some of the confusion. But I actually addressed the email to a vendor of ours. and so where I found it was under the personal area not really under financial recruiters and not under Alexander Raymond I'm not sure why it was there but there are no drafts anywhere else I've looked in the other two email addresses and don't find it and that's not a problem because the send to email address is correct this is simple but difficult for me I can't seem to get these emails to open. When I try to open it, I double click on the email to just review it before I send it. I get a no matches found and I'm just trying to click on it to open it. So what am I doing wrong? I mean, I'm looking at them. It might be best for me to see your screen. Do you mind if I send you an invite real quick to join a meeting? sure all right give me a second to put that together are you sending it under alexander raymond um i was going to send it as myself my name is mckenzie and uh it's just going to be like a google meet is that okay i can't hear you very well what was the last thing you said i was just going to send a Google meeting over. Is that okay? Okay. Okay. And are you sending it via email or? Yeah, I was going to send it via email. I'm just creating the invite right now. One second. What email do you have? I just want to know where to go look for it. I was going to ask you that, actually. I was going to say, where should I send this to? Hang on one second, because, you know, I don't know why this is. I have to investigate further, but I really hadn't had time to put my mind to it. You know, I have Gmail, right? I have three email addresses. And so occasionally, even though it's pinned to the toolbar and it's also pinned to the phone times, it will just disappear, right? And I have to put it back up there, which I just did. Email address for me. Thank you. Let me make certain because, like I say, I've got a bunch of emails and that's part of the problem. Okay. It should be Connie, uppercase C, D-O-N-N-I-E, at Alexander, uppercase A, Raymond, R-A-Y-M-O-N-C, uppercase R, dot com. It might reach me without it. Alexander Raymond R R-A-Y M-O-N-D dot com so the uppercases are C on Connie A on Alexander and R on Raymond okay Connie at Alexander Raymond dot com it says I'll just do it right now. Alright, I just sent you a meeting request via email. All right. If you'd like, you can turn your microphone and camera off. We just need the screen share capability of the meeting. We can't see this right here. We just have to go share our screen. This should be the right one. Are you seeing Chrome? Yes. Okay. Yeah, I see. I'm still kind of... Nope, that's not it. Where did I leave that? I just had it open. Okay. You might have multiple Chrome instances which all have multiple tabs, perhaps. If you hover at the bottom of the Chrome icon at the bottom of the screen, you might see multiple show up there. No, not at the bottom of it. I'm on PCR, so maybe it should be somewhere. Yeah, the Windows 11 interface has a bunch of icons along the bottom of the screen. Right, right. With Chrome, just hover over Google Chrome. Um, and you'll see, okay, so you have, okay, no, no. Okay. You only do have one tab. Nevermind. Sorry. I thought you, I thought you might've had like another one open. Um, okay. Right. I do that. I do. I do that sometimes, but I had, I had email opened and now it's gone. Oh, you can just open it again. Right. Uh, just go up to the top right corner and click PCR mail. Or are you talking about like clicking on an actual email on this am trust financial services record? I guess I'm asking you like, yeah, like show me an example of what's not working yeah well hang on one second i'm trying to get it straight in my head why i had pcr email open and now it's not open i don't see email there okay let me just make this think this through and see why this is now gone it'll do this it'll it'll just disappear and I'm like what the hell then I have to find it and try to reload it so basically I'm trying to get to an email that I did inside PC going to one of our partners offshore and now I don't think it is taking me back to this original basic search I I don't really want to send an email that's inside to one of these candidates inside Antrust Financial Services.
