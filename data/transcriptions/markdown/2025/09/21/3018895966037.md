## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Mean Sequence Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Yeah, we've had an issue that has been going on for several years now. It's very intermittent and have not been able to have it taken care of. The last time it happened, I think someone said to call in while it's happening on our end. That might be able to get us closer to a fix. So it's happening right now. And I was wondering if we can have someone look at that. The last person I spoke to about it, I think was Sean. Is he still there? Sean is not with us anymore. What company are you with? The Jacob Group. Okay. And what was your name? Matt Jacob. Okay, give me one second. Okay, and what's the issue? Like, what's happening? So our name screen is, you know, obviously organized how we prefer. And sometimes, not all the time, just randomly, when we open up a name record, the fields will be completely scrambled in a random order. So it's just, you know, people end up sometimes inadvertently putting things in the wrong field because they're just, you know, muscle memory. They're going to a field in a certain spot and it's not the right field. It's just causing trouble there. Okay. Here, give me one second. Let me do a little bit of digging on this. um looks like the last time we reported it was a bit ago um I mean I have looking back at my emails I've had um looks like the earliest the earliest email I can recall I'm pretty sure I asked them before this was even back to 2022 so there's been it's weird it'll be fine And then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, it'll, you know, everyone will start pinging me and saying, hey, it's happening again. And I'm like, OK, well. So Sean, in his signature line, it says lead support engineer. Who took his spot? um his name's uh mackenzie mackenzie took over for scott i mean uh for sean okay um just wondering who might be there that would have um mackenzie would probably be the person we want to bring in on this okay um like you actively have it on your screen right now so yeah the thing is if if i click on a name and it loads scrambled if I click on it again literally one second later it might load fine it might you know 10 seconds later it might load scrambled it's a roll of dice um but I have it up on the screen scrambled right now so it I don't know if that's going to do any good other than just a you know a visual of what's happening but I've sent you know screenshots of this many times before so okay I'm just we we it It looks like we've been tracking this in our ticketing system, so I'm just reading over that to take a look. Do you know if anyone's ever run or like re-indexed your database? I couldn't say for sure. Yeah. I'm wondering if that's a good thing. That sounds similar. I feel like we may have done that. I'm not sure if it was for this issue or something else. Yeah. When you say re-index, what exactly does that entail? Re-indexing your database is kind of like it's, to be completely honest, it's a little more tech savvy than I am. But I know it is just kind of like a general database health thing that needs to happen every so often. Like not to any particular frequency, but it does tend to be a good starting place when there is information loading issues. yeah i mean it's it's like that all the information is is there they're you know the the right data is in the right fields it's just the the actual fields on the screen are not in the right position that's all so it's like there's no scrambling of data or anything like that it's just um it's just like a like i said like the the front end kind of like the loading or something like that yeah um Let me see if I can get a hold of Mackenzie really quick. Give me one second. Okay. like you're saying that the fields are lining up with what the data should be. It's just, they're not in the order that they should be in. Right. Like it'll say first name, Stephanie, last name, Velasco, the phone number, and it has a phone number. So, but they're just not, like we have them grouped out in different sections on the page and the fields are just moving around to the different sections. If that makes sense. yeah so there's no like information in the wrong places it's just the layout itself is like shifting right yeah like the data that is pulling from like the the database itself seems fine it's just the way it's loading is scrambled like the configuration on the screen um do all of your um this might be a big question but do all of your users have the same layout or do people have different layouts based on different users? For the most part, they're all the same. There might be a couple that have a few. I think there's a couple people that have additional fields that really they only need access to. Do you know about how many users you have by chance? 10 or so. Okay. Around 10. So the things I'm thinking we could try. large scale, I would say we should try and re-index your database just to check. Because again, it's not harmful to do that...
