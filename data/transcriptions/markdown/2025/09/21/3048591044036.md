## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSequence Technology. Tyler, how can I help you? Who is this, Tyler? Yes. Hey, Brian, how are you? Good. How are you? Hey, good. So I own a company, and I was setting up a new person. And long story short, I have my admin, and I somehow changed the password. Now I can't remember how to get it back, and how do I change it so the admin and the password are cohesive again? Yes. So what you can do is if you go to system. I can't even get in the system, though. So I got my database as Lotus Technical, right? My username is admin, but now what's my password? How do I change that? Oh, so you've completely, like you can't log in with another admin level user? No, I only have one. Okay. So what I'll have to do, the only way we can reset a password is we have to send you a password reset form. Okay. And you have to fill it out and physically sign it and then send it back to us. And then we can reset you, give you a temporary password, and then it'll have you updated on your next login. Wow. Wow, wow, wow. That's quite the process. Okay. Okay. What's a good email address for you? B as in Brian. And then R-O-U. S as in Sam. Another S as in Sam. L-A-M-G as in George, at lotus technical dot com. Perfect. Is that coming to me now, you said, Tyler? Yep, I'll have it to you in just one second here. Okay, let's make sure before I... I'm going to go ahead and get my camera out of the way. All right. I just sent that on over to you. Not yet, I don't. What's it coming from? My email is ttroutman at mainsequence.net. Oh, there, I think I just flopped it. Oh, come on. Am I going to fill this form out? Yes. Yeah, so just if you print it out, fill it out, even if you just like take a picture on your cell phone and email it back to me, I can then. So my database, my username is admin, right? Yeah. That's the one I'm trying to get changed, yeah. Yep. Send me a password. Okay. Your database name is just Lotus Technical. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll get this printed out and get it over to you. Yep. And then you can either request a call or an email with the new password, the new temporary password. And then I'll set it up to when you log in with that temporary password. It'll prompt you to change the password to whatever you would like. Okay. I'll get that printed and emailed over to you here within about 10 minutes, hopefully. Great. Sounds good. All right. Thanks, buddy. Not a problem. Thank you. Goodbye....
