## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Ken Burnett. We spoke before. Anyway, I created a sequence, and it was attached to a roll-up. Okay. I subsequently created a more accurate, better sequence that I want to attach to the same roll-up. I tried to activate the newer, better one this morning, but it says I can't do it because the roll-up I want to assign it to is already assigned to another sequence. Is there a way I can, you know, discouple the roll-up to the first sequence to add it to the second one? Yeah, absolutely. So, yeah, you can only have basically one roll-up to one sequence ratio there. So you would want to permanently end the initial sequence so that the rollout becomes free. And you could do that by going to your sequencing in the main menu of PCR. Yep. I'm on there now. Oh, perfect. And then go to the overview tab where you'll see all of your lives. And then, yeah, just pause that one, the initial sequence so that you can right click on it. after it's been paused and hit end sequence. That'll permanently end it so the rollup becomes free. Got it. Okay. End sequence. You're about to end sequence. Okay. Oh, that's all I have to do. Okay. That was easy enough. And now I can go to sequence. I go to template. I go to the new one, activate, and let me see, rollup. Yep, that seemed to work. Okay, very good. Thank you so much. No problem. Reach out if you have any other questions. Will do. Take care. Bye....
