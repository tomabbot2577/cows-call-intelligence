## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, my name is Kevin. I'm using the PC Recruiter application. I just had a quick question. I was wondering if this is the right line to ask. Sure. What is your last name, Kevin? Petricello. Okay, with SC International? Yep. Okay. What can I help you with? um so let me pull it up but um under certain people's names we saw recently um like after i send an automated email from a campaign it appears under their activity as subscription status changed and then the word bounce in all capitals i was just wondering if that means they unsubscribed from receiving emails from us that usually means that their server returned like a rejection email. That's usually what it means. Let's see. Because I have, I've had it like, where like, you know, like one week sent an email to them and that didn't pop up. But then like the next week, now that's being shot back. So that could just be due to, for some reason, the email didn't go through. Did it say hard bounce or does it say anything like that? What database are you in? Sorry, let me pull it up real quick. Yeah, there's like a called Essex Final. Oh, let me double check. Just give me one second. I'm in Essex Final. Okay. Yeah, let me pull up an example. Are there a lot of them? I just noticed today, so I haven't checked to see how many yet, but I wanted to make sure I understood what it was before taking a deep look. Yeah, it can be a couple things. Like every once in a while, like if you do like a bulk email to a much larger group than your email provider will allow you to do, I think sometimes those might go into like a bounced list because who's an example of a person? Yeah, gotcha. The person Miles Blumberg, they're on a roll-up called Kevin's MKT 7.7. How do you spell Miles? Is it M-Y-L-E-S? M-Y-L-E-S. Okay. And then Blumberg. And his most recent activity shows. How do you spell Blumberg? I'm not finding that. B-L-U-M-B-E-R-G. I'm not finding. Am I not in the right database? Hold on one second. Oh, wait. Oh, Essex Final. I picked the wrong one. I'm so sorry. Hold on. Let me see. Let me just email somebody real quick here because I was supposed to be in a meeting with them. Here, let me just... um Okay. Let me try it again. I don't have a username called. Do you know who would look a username that's an administrator of the database? I wouldn't know. Well, my managing partner, his username is msacurco. Oh, you know what? I think that'd be scenario. Some scenario is going to be one. Hold on one second. I think I've... Oh, yeah, I'll go in first. Easier to spell. I'm better with it like Italian sounding names. My last name is Montoni. Okay, so I'm so sorry. What was the name? It was Miles. Miles Blumberg. If you can't find him, I have another example I can give you. Okay. Miles Blumberg. Let me first look at the activity that I wrote opt out. I wrote it's a bounce. Okay. July 9th. Let me see how many of those kind of activities you have. Yes. I haven't noticed them before. I don't know if it's just something I've missed in the past or. Have you noticed anything going into your inbox that. Like I'll get, I'll still get a like mail delivery system email if it doesn't go through. Okay. And you didn't get one for this person, you think? I got one. I'm checking now and I got one for them. But normally, like, those don't distinguish, like, why it didn't go through, at least on my end. Like, it just tells me, like, the email came through. Yeah, the email that you get comes back from their mail server. So it usually might say, like, you know, something that it's not found or, you know. Gotcha, yeah. Like, let's say this is sardine.ai. Like, if the person left the company and they turned off the account or something, it might have, that could be something. I just want to see if there's a whole bunch of opt-ons that day. And the thing is also, like, sometimes when I get these, like, mail delivery system emails where it says it didn't go through, I'll get responses from those people. Like, the email did actually go through and just for some reason it's telling me it bounced. but I've never seen at least never noticed I could have just been oblivious to but I've never noticed that like subscription status changed balance thing before you've got six of them that happened one two three you got six of them that happened on the sixth okay now let's see something now um okay and they all came in around the same time Let's see how many, let's see. Let's see. Your username is just Kevin, it looks like. Yep. Just opening up different windows is easier than leaving one. So I can refer to the other window. So activity 7-9 would be the date. And let's look for bulk email. Just in case you did like a much larger bulk email. So you try to bulk email 261 people that day. Let's go a little bit earlier in the day. So you sent them value of being compliant 7. Oh, so this wasn't sent as, oh wait, no, it was. I mean, it's hers. Hold on one second. Let...
