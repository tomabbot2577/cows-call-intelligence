## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Chad Petticord. How are you? Good. How are you, Chad? I'm doing great. Thanks. I know in the past you guys have been a little squeamish about talking to me regarding API access to my databases. I have a general question here. I have an API user account that has full permission in the names and security settings, and I can verify that the authentication works, and I can call on companies, but I get a 404 error every time I'm trying to, like, query a specific name. And so what I'm looking for is, do you guys know or can you check or help me check if the endpoint is available and turned on in my API environment? So we've simplified our API access. So there is no, like, endpoints turned, like, on and off. Okay. For the API. What endpoint are you using? I'm trying to hit the one that is for names. What I'm trying to do is simple right now is a call that just says, does the record Jason Chup exist? And while I get authenticated, I don't get a result. It returns no result, and it actually comes back with a 404 error. And this is the same if I'm trying to do the endpoint for companies and just trying to find a company like a company named Swinerton. Let me pop in here. Specifically, I have an API user account that's set up across all my databases. You know, it's the same account over and over again, but I'm specifically talking about my specialty trades database. What are you using to run the API call? Well, I've used two different apps. I've used Replit for one, and then the second thing I'm trying is a tool called Manus.im. I'm not familiar with any of those. Yeah. Manus is an agentic – basically, it's an AI that can take action, and so it can hit PCR and do it like through an agent browser type, but it also has the API connectivity, and so it has successfully run a script that looks at the specific REST URL, whatever that base URL is for my company and all that, and authenticates with my user password. And while it can see that there are companies, it can't find a specific company. If it can see their names, it still can't see a specific name. Now, you're using the candidates endpoint, correct, for names? In the case I started with talking to you, it is the names endpoint, yes. But I've even tried it for the companies and found the same issue. Okay. So I was going to say it's candidates as the endpoint for the name records. Yes. Okay. Let me verify on my end. I think that's right. I'm just going to go check my line of code here. This is a tricky subject, I understand, because you have to be technical. I am not. Well, typically with our API, that's kind of outside the scope of normal support. Right. like we because we have the open API and we allow free access to it but we don't we don't provide technical consulting support on it I understand yeah so we have our API documentation and I've been consulting that yes okay I can't confirm it is the candidates endpoint and then the slash companies is my other endpoint So, the not found error is what I get. And if I try it another way, I get a 404 error, which is, I think, the same as the not found, right? So, I'm just wondering, when you say you simplified it, does that mean it's enabled in general? It's just there. It's on. If I successfully set up a user, I should have access. I just have to figure out. Yeah, like what are you putting in as like your API key and your app ID? Specifically, hang on a second here. My API key or the user setting? So typically when you're setting up the connection, like it has you enter your API key, the app ID, and then your database URL. Right. The user I have is called API user, and then I have a password for that, and I also have a key. I gotta go look for it. It's down by text here. Oh, yeah. Okay, I've got it here. It's a long, drawn-out character. So the way we simplified our API access is you can literally just type in the words now, just like API key and app ID. You don't have to have that big, long string anymore. Okay. And then how are you pointing it at the database? Oh. So, let me go back and cover this ground while I'm looking for this. So, I've got my base ID, and then my specific API ID is specialtytrades underscore MR Indian Apples North. So, the HTTP address is like the www.pcrnet REST API access tokens, and then it has my database ID. And then I'm using... What you have is the database ID. Yeah, it's a specialty space trades.mrandianapolisnorth. And I got that from what I generated in the user settings for that. and then what was the name of the software that you were using in well I'm trying replit dot dot r-e-p-l-i-t dot com that's a a no code type of software creator and then the other thing I'm trying is manis.im my end goal just to kind of give you my overview is for example i have 500 records out of linkedin that i have found that previously like pcr capture used to look into pcr and say yeah the Chad record...
