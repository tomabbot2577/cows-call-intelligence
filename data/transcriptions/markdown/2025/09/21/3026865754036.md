## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. My name is Josh Hayden. I'm a current user, and I seem to have lost my PC Outlook portal. Okay. Are you using the Outlook Classic application rather than Outlook New? Honestly, I don't know. I got an error message in Outlook yesterday, and then it just went away. OK, gotcha. So if you go down to your search bar and the taskbar at the bottom of your screen by the Windows logo, type in Outlook and hopefully you'll get a result that says Outlook Classic. Yes, Outlook Classic. Awesome. So if you open that, do you see PC Recruiter in the main menu at the top at all? or is that no i don't it went away okay um try going to a file in the main menu of outlook and then there should be um something that says disabled or slow come add-ins um like a button maybe highlighted in yellow so yep okay click on that um does it list pcr underscore Outlook anywhere in that list? No. Okay. No. Let me pull up my Outlook and take a look. I need to do an uninstall, reinstall, or something? I am not sure. Let's actually jump on a screen share, and I'll take a look at your Outlook setup in a second. Go in a new tab in your browser to meetings.ringcentral.com. meetings.ringcentral.com? Yeah. Okay. ID? That is loading. One second. Yep. Take your time. That's 473-834-937. Open Ring Central. Join audio. Okay. And if you ask about, you could just mute that audio at the bottom left and then click the blue share button down at the bottom as well. And select your entire screen up at the top. One or two. It doesn't matter. We can just drag the Outlook over to whichever screen you share. Okay. Can you see my... Oh, yeah. There we go. Okay. So, yeah, it does have PCR Outlook listed there under the slow and disabled add-ins. Oh, okay. It does. Yeah. You want to do it or let me do it? I don't have control, but you can just click on options and then always enable this add-in and apply. Yep. Ah, there we go. Must be just the setting got changed, huh? Yeah, something might have slowed it down trying to load Outlook, and then Outlook proactively kind of shut off our add-in. So it should be back on now. If you hit close and go back to the main area, there we go. There it is. Okay. Well, that was simple. I knew it would be something simple every now and then it does that, right? Yeah, every once in a while that will happen for sure. Okay. But, yes, if you have any other trouble with that or if it keeps turning off, just let us know. Awesome. Hey, thanks, Garrett. I appreciate you. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Thank you, sir. Bye-bye. Bye....
