## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. I'm calling back in for the second time. I had to get off initially. Were you the first person I was talking to or probably not? I imagine. I don't believe so. Okay. So I'm new to the company, old to the business, new to the company, and this software, PC Recruiter, I had a spreadsheet with instructions. And so I did download everything, but my Java was out of date. So I updated that with the birth support person I talked to. And so now what I want to accomplish is I want to make certain that I have PCR, Java, and Launcher downloaded correctly and PCR captured. So that's what I need, and probably we need to share it for you to do that. Yeah, not a problem. Let me start up a meeting here. Then I will email you a link to join the call. What is a good email address for you? that's Connie with a capital C my capital C O-N-N-I-E at Alexander with a capital A-A-L-E-X-A-N-B-E-R Raymond with a capital R-A-Y-M-O-N-D dot com so Connie at Alexander Raymond dot com and the A and the R, those two names are uppercase, and the C on Connie is uppercase. All right. All right, I just sent the link on over to you. You should get it here in just a second. I'm looking to leave. How many emails? Three companies are on. This is the one that I work for. Just let me make sure I get on the right Gmail. I've got three Gmail accounts. I'm not kidding you. Let me open this. Here we go. We've got your meeting link. Oh, this is, never mind, this is coming in from somebody else. Pardon me. Urine central. Yep. Okay, that's what threw me for a loop. In my head, I'm thinking PC recruiter. Okay. yeah we just use the spring central video meetings and there you are i'll hit admit all right and if it asks you about uh connecting to audio you don't need to okay if you don't want to just you know what's on here yep i snap i'm quick i'm quick to throw a mouse around, you know, and that's not good. So can you see this PC Google Workspace marketplace that I mentioned? So you need to share the screen first in the video meeting. So at the bottom of the meeting window, you'll see a blue box with an arrow that says share. Should be sharing that now. So go ahead and click the stop share. You're going to want to share your entire screen, not just that workspace. That way I can check to see if you have the right programs downloaded. Otherwise, it just shows me that one screen. So it's got Chrome tab, but now shares right out. So up at the top, do you see where it says entire screen? Yes. So click on entire screen. And then you'll pick which screen you want to share. It should highlight it after you click it, and then you'll hit share again. Perfect. All right. Let me show you this spreadsheet. You may not need it, but you might. This spreadsheet where you can see PCR, a.k.a. PC Recruiter. There's a tech support I called in on. Download and install PCR, Java, and Launcher in all three of these. So I do believe that I've done that. And when we had to pull up Java, the first call I made, we had to update the Java. So that's been done. All right. So with the next one, you should be able to just click that launcher link. Yep. And then go ahead and click on where it says the PC Recruiter Launcher. Yep. you'll see it's running up there. Then go ahead and click on that. And you might see something pop up asking if it's okay to make changes. You'll just hit yes. I'm going to shut Adobe down because it's making it confusing. Let me try this again. Redirecting me. I'm saying Adobe could not open PC Recruiter Launcher because it is either not a supported file, blah, blah, blah. Okay, click on the top. Click the Downloads button again. And right-click on the DMG file. No, let's see. We're going to try and go somewhere else real quick. Go ahead and open up a new tab. Just like a new Chrome tab. Okay. Then did you receive your PCR login link yet? Yeah, I have them here. There's my... So click on that one that's the website. This one? Yep. Then in the bottom left-hand corner, you'll see where it says Launcher Install. Click on the one for Windows. When that's done downloading... Should I just get rid of PC Recruiter up here where you see my mouse? Yeah, you can get rid of that one for now. This is a redirect. I need to get rid of that too. Correct? Yep. All right. Go ahead and go to your downloads. Yep. There you go. Click on that. then you'll hit allow or yes whichever one it says i'm accepting the terms i'll move it over typical or custom uh typical See, I never got this far. Finish. All right, so that part's done. The next one we're going to do is you're going to see that little puzzle piece in the top right-hand corner of Chrome. Yep, right there. Go ahead and click there. put a little pin next to where it says PCR capture. Click that little pin next to it. And then you'll see where it says that www2pcrecruiter.net that whole big web address over to the left. Copy that entir...
