## 💬 Full Transcript

 How's it going? Hi. Hi. How are you? Ooh, another fun day. Aw. But this one, this one is really messed up. This grasslands thing. So I don't know why they set it up this way. I don't know what the deal was. But they're supposed to be paying $75 a month. for their users or whatever, which, fine, that's whatever. But I don't know why the invoice says $90-whatever Canadian dollars. I'm wondering when they charge their card, because I feel like we've asked Kathy about this. You don't do it for anybody else. And I could have sworn there was an email chain. I don't know if it was about them. I assume it's them. If your card charges you 90.85 or what the currency rate is, that's just the cost of doing business in another country. You're paying off 75. We're not giving money back to you to make the difference. I don't know why it's done like this. Here's the thing that doesn't make sense. We're charging them in US dollars, right? That makes sense. My guess is when they use their card, they get charged Canadian dollars. Yeah, for sure. Just like if I use my card in Canada, it's going to charge me whatever the current exchange rate is, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Apparently, they're wanting reimbursed for that. They didn't say anything about that, but what we are doing and what we did with the most recent invoice was we are charging them 90.85 as the rate and not $75. So they're paying like $15 more a user, unless somehow there's some magic that happens that I don't see. But I don't think that's true because this one has discount currency exchange. I think they were going in every year manually and discounting that off. I guess whatever, based on whatever the rate is. whatever the rate was at the time. But that doesn't make sense. You're already going to do that when you pay for it. I'm going to forward you. I'm trying to find some. I gave in cast uh Jim Labrado wrote no Jim Labrado wrote did anything ever happen this one I truly have no idea what a current current exchange discount is or what never heard of that The only thing I can confirm is that there are six users. There are only six logging in because we're trying to get them to pay. Like, everything about it is right. It's just that there's no reason for us to put – like, I think they used to do deals where you would pay in the currency of, like – like, you would pay in whatever currency for the other, like, place. Like, if you were in Canada, we would sell it to you, but we do it in Canadian dollars. My guess is they just complained about it. Because they were also just questioning, like, well, what is the recurrent rate? Like, I don't know. I've never even saw that. I think they got an invoice and they were wanting to know what the current rate was. And that's where it was like, I don't know. I've never even noticed that another invoice. But they, if they're at, so... so is it changed now wait let me see what's in there now because maybe it's been wrong the last two years because if it was actually at 75 dollars 75 times six is per what where were they uh this is the wrong invoice where's the right one Because there's a recurring in there too. Yeah. So it's just, I think it's, okay, so they have, let me do this. This is a little weird. There we go. Okay. So for six users, if it was $75 times six, that's $4.50 per month. but our rate is 545.10. Oh, did they actually put the discount? Oh, maybe this is the most recent one. Oh, okay. Currency exchange discount. Let me say something. Calculator. Okay, I'm in the recurring. The recurring is set up. Okay, so it's 545 per month. That is 545 divided by the six users. Okay. That's the 9085, the 545. So we're billing that at the Canadian rate. but then we must be discounting I guess we discounted what the currency exchange was. Yeah, so probably the difference of the 75 to the 90.85. Then they're not getting any annual discount, which makes no sense. Something is wrong with it. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe they just weren't offered an annual because they were already getting this currency thing. Maybe they were like trying to get both and they were probably like, screw that. But also, the currency thing doesn't make sense. because what is it? 90, 85. Yeah, so no, they're actually paying 66 a user because that's what 90, 85 would be. But I have no idea what they're they were doing. 75 times 6 is 450. times 12, that's 4,500, and that's over 5,400. I would think you'd want to do this completely different. Yeah, I don't understand why we're doing it like this. And also, that's wrong. 90, 85 is not, like... I don't know. Like, that number is never going to be right. Like, if our rate is $75, we should be putting that... Like in our terms. And then whenever they get paid, whatever they have to pay on their side, it is what it is. But that's the thing. It still is the same amount. They paid $5,400. And if you did 75 times 12, that is $5,400. You'd have to do, let's see, calculator. Okay, you would have to do 90, let's say th...
