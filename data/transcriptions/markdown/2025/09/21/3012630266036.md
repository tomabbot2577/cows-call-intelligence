## 💬 Full Transcript

 Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is not available. At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Hi, Adrienne. This is Robin. I just realized that it was not 2 to 1. It was 3 to 2. So I am still going to just skip the next one, so just so you know. So it will be corrected. So you will not get an August invoice, but you will get a September, and then September will be two users, not one. So we're really getting a little bit extra there because I just misspoke when we were on our call. Anyway, if you want to reach out to me, my number is 440-946-5214. I'm at extension 5466. Thanks....
