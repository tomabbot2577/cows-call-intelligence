## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good morning, Mrs. Jim. Hey, Jim. Hello. How are you? I'm well. How are you doing? Not bad. Not bad. And I think, is it you and Matt and Brad joining or anybody else? Yeah, Brad should be on in a second. Okay. Fantastic. Give him a minute to join here. Hey, how's it going? Not bad. Not bad. What's going on, Jim? All right. How are you? Doing great. Doing great. So I don't know. I think I may have left a message or kind of shared with you that I had used, we'd used this platform for, I think, maybe about 10 years previously. I don't know. You could probably look up and see what we had with you before. But we left because we had some frustration points on some of the things, and we started looking at other places, and I think may have gotten a little bit oversold on what the capabilities were. And, you know, but we've now kind of opened the Pandora's box of exploring some other things again. And, you know, there's some other products out there. And, you know, I'm super wary of being oversold on they can do everything. So I wanted to see what you guys have, what's changed, what's updated on your old Zen and just kind of get refreshed on the platform. Certainly, certainly. And what do you use right now? We use Top Echelon. Okay. Big Miller. Yeah. I think they have a newer product now or a new version. Yeah, they have a new, it's kind of an updated refresh on whatever. I mean, that was, you know, that's what they were using or that's, I don't know what it was like before, but it's a It's a little bit updated. We're also looking at Luxo. We've already rolled out a couple others, but obviously, you know, PCR now has some AI features. And, you know, I think we use some other outsourcing databases, you know, that we can obviously plug in through extensions. You know, we've got LinkedIn. We were having issues with the LinkedIn extension with you guys before, just putting it into the system. It just seemed like that wasn't being addressed. I don't know. But I don't know. You tell me, Jim. What's changed in the last two years with PCR? Well, let me show you around. Let me show you around a little bit. Yeah, so we actually have come out with a whole new product slash interface. We've added an AI suite. We've added the sequencing. So we have a few things that we've added and changed within PC Recruiter. Let me share my screen and kind of show you around what we've got here. Okay. Okay, so I should be looking at my sign-in screen for PC Recruiter right now. So I'll start kind of going through some of this, the newer pieces with the AI and kind of some of the things we've done. Some of this might look a little the same, some a little bit different. So as I go through, I'm going to go ahead and get myself logged in. Okay, so this is PCR 9. So this is the PC Recruiter that you use, PCR 9. This has been around for about 10 years, maybe a little more. and it has been kind of kind of rounded up a little bit they've cleaned it up some so still going to be menu bar at the top still going to be middle area searching search results bottom areas for the records themselves so one of the new things we added had you seen the sequencing at all did you use that i think you guys just added that before um but i guess give us a quick run down on that sure sure so what the sequencing does we've added that piece into PC recruiters like a drip campaigns and it's a new option up here it kind of opens it launches a new window here this is going to give you an area where you can build templates so you can build a template of your sequence whatever it's going to be and it could be email only so it could be sent one email pause five days send a second pause three days send a third so you could do something like that or it could be something like this one that sends an email maybe the next that's a call it adds it to a call list for you and then maybe the next step after that might be an email could also include prompts to schedule a follow-up or do a LinkedIn related item or send a text through ring central or anything like that so you can build different templates in here and they could be a number of different automations so you can kind of pick how you want it to be runs off of a roll-up list and let's say that I had one that I started I did because I have my task list here maybe the first step was an email was sent and then anyone that opens that email gets added to my call list. So it's going to run a call list in here for you that you can click into each person. It's going to open up kind of a snippet of their information, their activities. You can click to dial with RingCentral. You can read a script. You can kind of pre-populate a script in that sequence. And then when I'm done, I can mark them whatever happened. That'll move them on to the next step and kind of kick off whatever the ne...
