 Hello? Hey, Robert. It's Rob in Montoni. How are you? Sorry, I was in a longer call than I expected. So, yeah, your issue, simple to fix. Ready? We've just got to clear cache images and files in your browser. Let me know when you're ready, and I'll take you through this stuff. Hold on. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Are you in Chrome? Yes. Okay. Go to the three vertical dots at the top right of Chrome, and it's going to pop up a menu. Yes. Click Delete Browsing Data, and then don't do anything else until I walk you through. Let me know when you're at that screen. Okay. I'm at that right now. Okay. For time range, set it to all time. All time, yes. Okay. uncheck browsing history and cookies and other site data only leave cached images and files selected that's the only ones checked okay click delete data clear now okay and then fully exit Chrome we shut it down completely yeah just Chrome just your browser you can keep any other apps up. Okay. And then if you go back to PCR, it should work. Ooh, that's quick. Yeah, sometimes, like, you know, if things like update and stuff, your browser tries to cache it so that it loads quicker. But when things change, it can cause a problem. So occasionally clearing cache should fix it. no I still can't delete okay now you said clear data sorry did you say clear data or delete data I thought you were saying clear I'm not 100% sure let's also try this I wonder if your browser is maybe outdated, that could be another thing. If you go to the three vertical dots again and then go to help. Help and feedback? Help. Yeah, help and then go to about Google Chrome. What that'll do is it'll check for updates to Chrome. Actually, sorry, I'm using Edge. Microsoft Edge.

So hold on. So make sure you say time range, all time. All time, yes. Uncheck everything, leaving only cached images and files selected, and hit clear now. So the only one that will have the check mark is cached images and then clear now, correct? The only one you want to select is the cached images and files. Everything else you uncheck. But I just did this. Okay, so were you in Chrome or Edge when you did that? I haven't changed, Edge. Okay, all right. All right, let's do a screenshot. I'm going to send you an invite here real quick because that should fix it. What am I going to? Meet and get your email address. Robert.Sandler at SandlerSearch.com, right? Correct. See, I've got on my screen here, I check clear now, and then what comes up is prophecy search and services clear browsing data. Choose what to clear. What's going on with that? Okay.
