## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hello. Hi, Robin. How are you? Hi, I'm good. I have a feeling that somebody messed up Tina Roberts' invoicing. Oh, no. So this is like really odd. So now that I look at this, it looks like they used to go every six months. And then in January, it's like two rows of six months. so really she did pay for the year now why there's two rows on that one invoice i don't know unless she wanted to do go ahead and pay for the year which means she's paying annual and not every six months she should not have gotten a january and july first invoice oh i don't remember anything about what she was doing and she's just sending all these emails saying oh i paid here it is And I'm like, what? Yeah, I have a feeling like this one. I also wonder if that should not have been generated. Like sometimes if they wrote in and. Because it does say out of state, it could be that they kind of replaced her invoice template. I've run across that with a few. So wait, what is her one that she went ahead and sent one today? They sent a check in January. Check number, pay for the whole year. Okay. Yeah, I think she's right. I'm going to call her. Okay. So she might have. Yeah, because this one, I'm like, wait a minute, that is double. So I went into the actual invoice from January 1st of 2025. And there are two rows. in there for six months. I don't know why not. Instead of making it a year. So if she wants to do annual, then that covers her until next January. And she's in collections and marked credit card monthly? She's not really in collections. Okay. I got to update that. And that's just only because this July one. But I don't think she should owe it. so what I need to do is does she really want to be invoiced every six months or annually in January but this one needs to be voided groovy the July one okay I'll get it handled awesome thank you alrighty alrighty and thank you for looking at all those yeah I think what they did is I think they replaced her recurring template with an older one. So, and then I'm sorry, what did you just say? Thank you for looking at all those July sales numbers and everything like that. Yeah. No word on that one person though, the kinetic? Yeah, the kinetic. And if it's, like, I think we'll just pull it off if Bill agrees, because it won't confuse anything because they didn't even pay and they've never used. and no they paid that one while they paid and then and very oddly like within minutes of it being sent they were weird because when i demoed them i demoed the guy and i did i thought he was one user and he's like i want to buy i'm like all right and it was a little surprising and he's like oh five users and i was like really and then he he said send me the agreement i'll look at it and then he paid it like that day like sign paid everything and i was like well that was oddly quick, but then I could never get a hold of him again. And his number is disconnected. The number on the website is disconnected. But I don't know why anyone would do, like what kind of a scam is, like why would you do that? Waste all that time just to do that. Because you have no access to the database. You got nothing out of it. I don't get it, but I can't get a hold of him. It's really weird, isn't it? Yeah. I had one like that last year too. They signed up, paid, they paid for a few months and then they stopped paying and then I could never get a hold of them again never again I think that one guy I think yeah I think I know that guy I think we've been trying to trick him down for billing yeah you just can never get a hold of them that's the weirdest thing yeah I think that um what is it kinetic kinetic pair let me oh no if I go to Bill or Jeannie I can see the timeline so that initial but right now it's still saying is paid but it's disputed I don't know like how Kathy has to mark that but but what was also very very odd that Kathy said normally when there's like a dispute like you know the person claims a dispute and it doesn't like do it right away like it's you know you can say oh here's the contract i guess and you know you can actually go through a dispute process they don't give it just right back yes they have to prove it like prove what was wrong and prove they didn't sign or whatever yeah so cassie was like calling me emailing me and i was just like i'm like all right you know she's like i'm on with gretchen now she's like This one, they actually refunded it back right away. So maybe this, yeah, it was very odd. So maybe it's some company that, I mean, obviously they got the email to even pay the invoice, which is odd. And then even, wasn't it the domain bouncing or something, or the email? I can't remember if the email was bouncing. It was really strange. But anyway, this invoice for the initial. Let me look at the timeline. Let me look at the timeline. It was like super fast. Okay. Invoice created. This is all on the 17th. It was created 6-18. It was sent 6-19, opened at 6-21, paid 6-22. Yeah, it was quick. An...
