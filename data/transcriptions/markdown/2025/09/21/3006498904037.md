## 💬 Full Transcript

 Integrity Bookkeeping, this is Teresa. Hi, is Kathy available? Yes. Is this Robin? Yes, it is. Okay, hold on just a minute, please. All right, thanks. You're welcome. Thank you. Hold on just a second. I've got to try and get my... Can you hear me? Yeah. Yep, I can hear you. Okay. I have a few customers to review with you because I owe them answers. Okay. Let's first start with Job Bank because you just emailed me again, and it was an issue from last week. customer's name is Job Bank dash Montgomery County Job Bank Montgomery County okay okay if you go to the invoice dated 1-1-25 you'll see they made a payment after that but look at the invoice so they're wondering why they're getting this balance and it looks like money was added but then tax was added on top of it so it's like the 1900 dollars or whatever the balance is and they're actually tax exempt so that that was not supposed to be a positive number uh somebody made a mistake because it's supposed to be yeah it's supposed to be um wait they're tax exempt yeah so it's not only are they tax exempt that they're he says they're not supposed to be charged tax at all but they're applied tax as a positive number and then tax applied at the bottom so they really got taxed twice well now making it look yeah yeah the discount was supposed to be a negative number so that it offset the tax that was calculated on it. And they shouldn't be charged tax anyway because they're tax exempt. Yes, they're tax exempt. Okay. So I want to do this one to you because the 1283280 was the correct number and that's what they paid. Yes, yes. I'm going to get out of the invoice now that. Hold on. That way only you are in there. So let me just say, I see the customer tax exempt at the top. Okay. I don't know how we missed that. Well, I added that later because I didn't even know. I added that customer tax exempt. Okay. Just so that we saw it going forward. Yeah. We'll have to adjust that because we paid tax on that because we didn't know that business services was actually a tax exempt thing. So, yeah, I fixed that. Okay. All right. So I will go in. I will email him back. Yeah, that was a mistake. Sorry. let's see so I'll just go over to QuickBooks or not QuickBooks I'll go to the Biller Genie pull them up and reach and send let's see Montgomery I won't even do it that way I'll just go this way I'm gonna just show them like one that it's showing that it's paid now okay All right, so let me do this. Invoice number. I sometimes wish it defaulted to all. Export to PDF. Okay. Save it. Okay, so what is this? I see Job Bank, Montgomery. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay, so that is one. Okay, so he is done. I can get rid of his. Who are the other two? Okay, we'll back up here a little bit. I just sent you another email about somebody that's going to have to be reimbursed for risk work. For what work? Risk, R-I-S-K W-O-R-K It was one of those where we had modified the recurring and then somehow an edit updated the recurring back to the original number of users. Okay. So the invoice, let me know when you're there. I am on there. Okay, so the invoice dated 7-2 should have been for 78-23. I already changed the recurring but there's no notes do you mind just making a note about the correct users there we don't put users there they change all the time oh I see that's right nobody ever really used notes nobody really used notes that much I've been starting to use it more when it's like a cancellation or when I put them on hold or typically user change, we just go into the recurring because their next invoice should be whatever their new rate is. We don't usually touch the existing invoices. Well, that's part of the problem, though, too, is that the recurring ones were all, since nobody touched it, they didn't notice when it wasn't working right. Yeah, like when somebody does a user change, we don't change their existing billing. We just change it going forward, which is why we just go into the recurring. So when somebody's editing an open one or something from the transaction list, like an actual invoice, I think, again, they're hitting that update recurring. And if we do something, I always do it separate. Yes. And I think when we were trying to get all the sales tax updated because there was all kinds of wrong accounts associated with it, I think that's why. I believe we've gone through all of those now so that we shouldn't have that issue. And then I've got, you know, Dana was looking at, like, all the ones this week to see if we had any, you know, that could potentially have gotten changed. And then we're just going to keep looking, you know, on the current ones just to make sure that we try and catch any of those that might have changed and changed back. But QuickBooks has drives me nuts. So, we need to make a, we need to credit this one, the risk work. They need a refund, a refund of 156.45 for risk work. Because they went from three to one. Okay. Yep. So the refund is $156.45. That needs to go...
