## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, Susanna speaking. Hi, Susanna. My name's Mackenzie. I'm with PC Recruiter. And I'm calling you back. I think you called last week and left a message. And we've been kind of busy and there was a holiday. And so I'm finally getting around to calling you back and asking you if you have time or would like to give me more context on the message you left us. Oh, somebody called me. I fixed it. It was all good. Yeah, no worries. Somebody else already got you? Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe there's duplicate tickets or something. I have a ticket assigned to me with your name on it. Nobody updated it. Maybe there's another one or maybe you called back. Yeah. No, I'm all good. No, they called back and it was fixed. I'm all good. I appreciate you calling. Thank you so much. Oh, great. Okay. All right, Susanna. Okay. Thank you. Okay. You're welcome. Have a good day. Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
