## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Matt. Hey, man. This is Tyler over at PCR. How are you? Good, Tom. How are you? Doing good. Doing good. Got your voicemail ticket in here. You were adding a new employee? Yeah, and I think I sent something to Brian Cain. Usually he helps me, but he might be busy. So I had somebody leave, and I'm just replacing that person. Okay. Okay, so you don't need any, like, account changes. No. So I guess I go on, let's see, I go on systems, right? Yep. And system, and then users. Okay. And then manage users? Yep. Okay. Okay. And then in there you'll have the option to add a user in that options menu. Okay. I'm on that. Put her full name in. Yep. Okay. And then her email address? Yep. Do the email address, contact phone. You don't need to do right off the bat. if you don't want to okay i got that um security information is where you'll set their username and password so um uh and then there was already a password in there. Just erase it? Yeah, because it'll try and like auto-fill your password. I'll just do 1234 or something. I usually say do like PCR123 because if you just try to do 1234, it'll flag it and say that. PCR123. Yep. Okay. and then you'll see our pass warranty all right and then the enroll in lms that just gives them access to our learning management system it's just another free training resource that'll be able to log into and do like the click through courses what about model user you could just leave that as no okay so we did that and then other information you don't have to worry about. And then I have, it says copy options from username. I kind of want to mirror it to what the other people have. Yep, yeah. So you'll see, if you click into that dropdown, there's a list of model users. Yep. So you'll just select which one you want to copy from. You can check that copy security if that person's going to have the same securities. Okay, and then hit save. Yep. Got it. Okay, I don't know why I can't never remember this. All right, so then they'll get an email, correct? So they'll get an email for the LMS. You'll want to send them a separate email with the database URL, so like the URL from the login page, that www.pcrecruiter.net, and then send them their username and password as well. Got it. All right. I think I figured that out. I know I've hired like eight people, and I never can figure – I'm just a moron. You know, I'm almost 53 years old. I'm in that in-between stage. But the whole stupid recruiting business is all geared around tech. And it's all expensive, right? I mean, between LinkedIn recruiter and all the AI shit. But, hey, do you think PCR will ever have a deal where it's just going to be, everything's going to be integrated, where you really don't even, you might have a database, but you're just searching off of a wrapped technology, off of AI? So that's a little tricky because, like, a lot of other softwares, like LinkedIn and ZoomInfo, block stuff like that. Because they want you to use their products and their products only. So even with the capture tool, we run into that issue. I'm sure someone's going to try and do it at some point, but it's a lot more complex than people think. Yeah. Especially when you're working with third parties. Right. Now, is this user going to be a system admin? Like, do you want them to have full permission in the database? Okay. So what we're going to do here, go to system, users, manage users again. Yeah, no problem. System, users, manage users. Yep. And then you'll click on their username. Okay. And then you'll click the security lock. over on the left-hand side. Yep. And then under where it says System Administrator, you'll turn that permission to full permission. Okay. And then you'll hit Save over on the... That little floppy disk icon or go into the Action menu and hit Save. So that way they have the permissions they need in the database. That's the only one that doesn't copy over. alright I appreciate it and we'll get something over to her and hope you have a great weekend okay you as well if you need anything else or anything just let us know thank you sir take care you too...
