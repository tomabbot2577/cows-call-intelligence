## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, you said Tyler? Yes. Hey, Tyler. Hey, this is David. I own a recruiting firm, and I have your product. I use Main Sequence. And I'm not sure if there's a problem going on with it right now or if it's just on my side, but I'm trying to use the – I guess I don't remember what the name of it is called – the PCR capture. And as I try to capture people, it's not taking the company name anymore. So I have to capture them into the system. It'll go under candidates, and then I have to move them from there to a company. Is that something you guys are experiencing right now? No. Okay. If you click your capture, are they going into your database's default company? Let's see. If I try to put this person in here, it's going into, you know, it's so funny that I just did this. Let me see something. Actually, I wasn't captured. I was something else. Pull it up real quick. All right, if I click on it, it is thinking. And now it's showing the company name. Okay. that's so weird all morning it hasn't been showing the company name and as soon as i call you it sounds like you you might have accidentally had a toggle turned on so if you click the capture extension up at the top in your browser like right next to the puzzle piece there's those three modes like basic mode you don't want that one on that one's as advertised like you don't get review options but we also have that capture default company And if you had that toggled on, what it would do is just add every candidate that you're adding into the database into your default company and not bring in the company information. Okay. See, it's working now. Yeah. So where – it's not working now. So where is the – can you explain that to me one more time? I was actually just checking something out just to make sure I'm not losing my mind. But, yeah, it's not working. There must be some sort of toggle switch you mentioned, right? So like when you say it's not bringing it, like is it bringing up the review screen, but there's just no company information? So let's say I have somebody on LinkedIn. I press the capture button. It'll bring up the person's name, and then I'll press the review button. And then on the bottom, it'll say company capture name recorded will be added to candidate. Okay. So yeah, that's your default company. Okay. So click the capture extension up at the top. in your browser. Okay. Right. Do you have, you see that captured a default company? Yes, I do. Is that toggle to the right? It was. Yeah. Yep. So you'll toggle that off to the left. Okay. Not sure how that happened, but okay. Makes sense. So that, that's what controls them just automatically going to the default company. And then when you go back to LinkedIn, just make sure you refresh the page. gotcha okay yep it works now all right perfect i figured it was something small or you guys were having some sort of an issue okay i appreciate the help thank you have a great day bye...
