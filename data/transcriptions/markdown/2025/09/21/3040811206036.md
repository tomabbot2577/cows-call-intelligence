I've had this problem like a few times in the past where I have to download an Adobe something because I'm on an Apple, not a Microsoft computer. Yeah, I was wondering if you had like the Amazon Coreto link installed like the PC URL. Can you do a screen share with me? Yes. Okay. And what is your name, please? it's joe or joseph lucas l-u-c-a-s and the company search max inc okay here's my one second here i've got way too many things open yeah it's just going to get confusing here we go is your email joe at mri search max.com yes yes okay all right i'm going to send you an invite through google meet Okay, I sent you a meeting, a Google Meet invite. Okay. All right, so I'm going to have you, Joe. And you can, like, mute the microphone since you're already on the phone. Otherwise, it causes a lot of background interference. Okay, I'm going to have you click the share screen option at the bottom of the meeting screen, but then go over to where it says entire screen. And then under entire screen, in case you have more than one monitor, make sure you pick which screen to show me and then click share. It says open system settings. Yeah, that's your Mac preferences.

Can you go up at the top right where you have like the quick add option where is that a top rated piece recruiter okay I mean there we go click on that the quick editor lightning the lightning bolt option go to name and then select parse from resume because this tells me if it's just the Amazon Coreto and Peace Recruiter Launchpad. Go ahead. Yep, hit start for me. Yeah. Okay. All right. Let's cancel out of here. And then I'm going to have you close that. And then let's close. Or you can just reuse this tab. Go to the top where you have the URL and replace that. We're going to do a search for Amazon Coreto 8. How do you spell Coretto? C-O-R. I can't remember. It's two R's. Oh, here it is. Coretto. No, go back and do that again. Or put the number 8 after that. Amazon Coretto 8. Okay, click that. downloads for Amazon Coreto 8 and then within that table go down like a little bit I think it's going to be past the Windows 64 where it says Mac OS 64 click on the link that ends in jdk.pkg click on that one right there Okay, go ahead and open that file.
