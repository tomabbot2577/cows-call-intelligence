## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Garrett. May I help you? Yes. Could I please speak to Gretchen? Oh, she's no longer with the company. Is there someone else that can direct you to? No, I was just wondering. I wanted to talk to Gretchen because I keep getting phone calls, like several a day, or texts for this Gretchen. and Kubasek and I am not her. And I block these calls and I tell these people and I keep getting them. So I was just wondering what this Retch and Kubasek does and why I'm getting her calls. Oh, I'm so sorry. Yeah. She, she used to be with our company, but she's no longer with us. I wonder why that they're so calling her then. These are companies calling and wanting to let her borrow all this money. I am not this person. And they keep texting and calling me. In fact, the other day I was really pissed because I got this one text for Gretchen, and I texted back, F you. And then the person texted back, okay, Gretchen, And then it said JK, which stands, I guess, for just kidding. And then they put my name down. It's like, well, obviously, you know that I'm not hurt. So why are you bothering me? Yeah, it's like they're kind of harassing you. Yeah, if you click the numbers somehow. I've tried. I've tried and I keep getting it. And this has been going on now for almost a year. Oh, man, that would be really annoying. Yes, it is. Wow, I wish I could help you out on that. I didn't know if maybe this Gretchen had, I didn't know if maybe this Gretchen, her phone number was like pretty close to mine or something. I don't know. Oh, yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, I don't have her phone number here anymore. Let me check, double check that, but I don't think I have it listed here. No, yeah, she was removed from the employee list. Yeah, I don't know. I guess maybe, I don't know. Did she start another business or something? Do you know if she started another business? Yeah. Yeah, I'm not sure. I haven't really heard from her since she left. Since she left? Yeah. Well, I know what she looks like because I looked it up and naturally saw her name and what she looked like. And it's like, you know, this is crazy. It is going to be kind of like an harassment as far as I'm concerned. But if she has no idea this is going on, yeah, I know. I mean, these companies that are sending me these things, well, you know, do you need this much more money for your business? Blah, blah, blah. And it's like, I'm not her. Wow. Yeah. Hopefully you can find a way to block them. I've tried. Believe me. I've blocked. I've blocked. I've, you know, deleted and it seems like when I do that, just more and more keep coming. Oh, wow. I don't know. Sorry, I couldn't help you out today, but best of luck to you. Oh, thank you. I'm sorry I bothered you. No worries. No worries. All right. Yeah, you have a great rest of your day. You too. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye....
