## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yeah, my name is JP Wright. I use PCR for our contact management software, and I have some questions about the sequencing portion of PCR. Yeah. And I'm not sure who I need to talk to about this. Yeah, I can answer any questions that you have. okay so I know that we have it but we have to pay something to get it set up I guess the version of it that we pay for comes with it but we need something I guess we have to pay for something to turn it on technically you can just activate it and you can pay for like a couple hours of training for it more times than not okay and so yeah i i would just have to get you in touch with one of our account representatives and they'd be able to go through all that with you okay so i i guess i have a have a couple questions about how it works um like so i've been using source whale which is like similar to the sequencing, but it's, I guess it's kind of the same thing, but on steroids. So, like, some of the steps that you can set up in PCR, like, you guys also offer the option to, like, set up, like, LinkedIn, like, it'll prompt you to do, like, LinkedIn steps, like, to connect with people or send them messages. Yeah, what it'll do is those are, like, manual steps. We don't connect to LinkedIn. It's more of a reminder. If you have their LinkedIn profile already on the name record, it can help you jump to LinkedIn to perform that action. Okay. And, like, can you put in, like, the text of, like, say you have, like, a search that you're working on, and you have, like, a standard, like, LinkedIn intro that you're sending to people. Can you put that text in that step so you can just copy it from there? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so in each of the manual steps there's like an instructions section and like a script section. Okay. So you can put any text in there to like if you were copying and pasting. Okay. So it's similar to that, to the way SourceWheel works. It just works directly from within PCR. Yep. And I know SourceWheel does offer an integration with PCRecruiter as well. Uh-huh. So if you're comfortable with that tool and you're already using it and you're already paying for it and you like that product, you can always reach out to them as well about that integration. They are an integration partner. I am using it, but I have a couple other people that work for me that I don't know that they'll use it enough to justify the cost. Yeah. So for some of the things that we're doing, I think it might be helpful to have some of the more – to ask them to do shit in SourceWale, they'll lose their minds. It'll just be too much for them to mess with. I'm wondering if trying it through PCR is a simpler step to start with. Yeah. We also offer a webinar on our Learning Center page. so if you go to learning.pcrecruiter.net we have a webinar section and the first webinar in there is actually on our sequencing feature and that's always we typically recommend people take a look at that before they start with sequencing just kind of grasp of what the tool can and can't do and just how it generally learning.pcr.net Learning.pcrecruiter.net pcrecruiter.net PC Recruiter 9 It'll be over where you see like home and those buttons over on the right you'll see where it says webinars. Oh, yeah, there you go. Webinars. Sequencing feature. Yeah, that's kind of broken down into four different sections. Okay. The first one kind of, the first section kind of just goes over sequencing in general. Okay. All right. Yeah, I'll look at those. I'm guessing that it works similar similar enough to source whale that I can kind of I know it's going to end up happening like I'm going to have to set up like the steps of the sequences for these guys and kind of guide them through using it so yeah well that's kind of with the like if you decide to activate the feature and get the training you can kind of break it it's typically two hours of training for sequencing the first hour is kind of just like the rough explanation in the admin training and like setting up the sequences and kind of going over what they can do and then the second part we can break down into okay this is the admin side of you've created a template how can you activate it for other users and then a smaller training with the rest of the team like, hey, this is the only stuff you have to worry about. You don't have to worry about the other building it part. That was going to be my next question was like, if I create a sequence in PCR, can everybody access it? Depending on their securities, yes. Because each sequence is tied to a roll-up list. Okay. So in order to run a sequence, the person has to be in a roll-up? Yes. Okay. And so let's say you create like a general template. Yep. That you want all your sequences to follow. Yep. You could activate that template multiple times and just you rename the name of the sequence and just pick a different roll-up list each time. Okay. So you...
