**[0:13] Speaker_01:** I don't know what happened there.

**[0:39] Speaker_01:** I've been in, like, a whirlwind lately, I feel like.

**[0:43] Speaker_03:** Okay, so do I.

**[0:45] Speaker_03:** So we went with, we tried another ATS-CRM combination thing that just, you know, it was one of those where, you know.

**[0:53] Speaker_02:** Pretty demos.

**[0:54] Speaker_03:** Pretty demos.

**[0:55] Speaker_03:** And, hey, this is how we do it.

**[1:10] Speaker_03:** I'm direct enough that people actually don't like me sometimes.

**[1:13] Speaker_03:** And I'm okay with that because at least we all know what page we're going to be on.

**[1:17] Speaker_03:** And when I tell you I need A, B, C, and D, and you tell me I can do A, B, C, and D, and then we try A, B, C, and D, and it turns to X, Y, and Z, now I'm not happy.

**[1:26] Speaker_03:** Now shit's going the wrong way.
