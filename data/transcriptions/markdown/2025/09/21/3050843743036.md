## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. My name is Vern. And we have PCR. And I'm actually, I'm sorry, I should say I need technical support. Is that something you can help me with? Yes. What's your last name? Saul, S-H-A-U-L-L. Okay. With the Newell Group? Yes, ma'am. Okay, what can I help you with? So I was having trouble with this before, parsing resumes from Microsoft Outlook, and I just had to replace my computer a week ago, and today they gave us their, you know, went in and set my system back up. So I'm back to the problem of not being able to parse resumes. Okay, probably missing some apps. Any chance you have RingCentral? I do. You do? Okay. easier to screen share them that way. Okay, if you open up your RingCentral app... Alright. Um... Then... Let me know when you're there. I'm not there. Because I'm trying to find it and I can't find it. It used to be on my toolbar down at the bottom. And it's not there now. Have you reinstalled it since you're your new computer I don't know if you go to your Windows search option type the word ring okay and then do you see ring central with the word app underneath it yep okay click on that click on that or click open either way it'll open it for you. All right. Okay. All right. So you should be in your app, I assume? Not yet. It's installing. I'm just going to warn you, I'm not very tech savvy. Okay. Okay. Alright. I've got a window that popped up. Actually, I'm going to close that. Alright. I found it on my toolbar on the second monitor and I clicked on that and opened it up. Okay. So I have the app open. Okay. So once the app is open, you're going to go to video at the top left. Okay. And then select join. All right. And then it's going to ask you for a meeting ID number. Meeting ID number. Are you ready for that? Yep. Okay. Okay, 050-394-810. Okay. Now, what will happen once it's putting you in, it's also going to ask you about joining computer audio. Don't join with computer audio since we're already on the phone. Okay. Except the cookies. Yeah, I guess that's okay. I'm going to have you click share at the bottom of your screen and then go over to entire screen and you'll select on which screen to show. I'm sorry say that again. click share make sure you're under entire screen a tire screen entire screen oh I'm sorry that's okay sorry all right okay so I clicked on entire screen okay then you're gonna click on what screen to show. Okay, I'm going to slide you over to my main window. Bear with me one second. It's easier to see if I show you on my bigger monitor. Okay. All right. So there's a couple things that you might be missing. Can we do this? Can you go down to the bottom of your Windows app? I'm sorry, down to your Windows search option, just to the left of all those apps that are listed, and type the word app, A-P-P, into the search box. I don't see a search box. You were just down there. Your cursor is down at the bottom. Type the word app in there. Okay, all right. Okay, see where it says system settings? Go ahead and click on that. Okay, click apps over at the left and then go to installed apps which is the first choice at the top right. Okay, so I'm going to have you scroll down to the J's. We're going to make sure you have Java, which is also going to be needed. Okay, don't have that, it looks like. And then let's go down to the P's. And we're going to look for P's Recruiter Launcher as well as P's Recruiter Portal. I think you're going to be missing both. Okay. All right. So we got three things to install. Okay. So let's close out of this window. And might as well close out. look or actually you know what while we're here let's go file up at the top left go to options because if this is new a new setup we might have to show something here okay go to options see where it says optimize for best appearance over at the right and that pop-up window okay you're going to flip Flip that to optimize for compatibility. Okay. Okay. Then you're going to go to add-ins in that gray sidebar at the left. And while we're here, let's click go down at the bottom. And the one I want to at least have you turn off is when it says social connector 2016. That one seems to take a lot of memory. And if you don't use OneNote within your Outlook, you can turn off that one too. but at least do social connector. Okay, let's hit okay. Is OneNote the same as, what do we use, where multiple computers talk to each other? No, it's almost like sticky notes, but in your Outlook. Wow. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, okay. Okay. At least the social connector one seems to help. Let's hit okay. All right. And then let's go file and choose exit. Okay, let's go down exit. All right, so we're out of Outlook for now. What I'm going to have you do is open up a browser, and you're probably, like, having issues with alarms and opening, like, resumes, attachments, a whole bunch of stuff. So these installs I'm going to give you are going to fix all that. O...
