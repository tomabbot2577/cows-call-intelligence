## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hey, McKenzie. I can't get into PCR. I was trying to implement a security, I guess a level of security using one password, and somehow it blew away my old password and doesn't recognize anything. Does that make sense, sort of? Sorry, I was just typing what you said. I don't know exactly what one password is. Is that a program that is a password tool? Yeah, it is. password generator. Okay. And are you getting locked out of PC Recruiter or do you just not know the password or both? It could be both. I don't know. I don't know if I'm locked out or not. But basically I'm trying to change the password and get to the password change screen because I don't have the old one. I don't know it. It was generated by this system. So that's why I'm calling you. I think I've reached the end of my technical ability. Okay. Okay. We can figure it out. So, all right. Well, first I need your name and the company you're calling from so I can pull up your account. Okay. It's Pete. And the last name is Blemker. It's B-L-E-M-K-E-R. and I'm with Broadreach Staffing. All right. I found Broadreach Staffing. I'm going to the login screen. I see two different databases. Yeah, our database is Broadreach Staffing. Okay, great. And then what's the username that you're trying to log into? It's my email address. It's Pete at broadreadstaffing.com. See if you're locked out or not. And that's all caps if it matters. Yeah, the username is default to be capital. Okay, let me look. I got an invalid credentials error as well, even with my password. So I'm going to pull you up on the back end. Hold on. Let me just go the long way around. Broad reach staffing. Okay. Scenic route here on the back end. Go to the broad reach staffing database. Okay. been around for a while this is on a older instance of our sequel broad reach staffing i'm going to look at the user records table and see like who else are you a one user no there's quite a few users probably oh nice okay that's going to make it a lot easier because in order for me to change your password we have to go through like the red tape of like sending a form and you have to get it signed and all this very like you know security measures and to prevent people from calling up and like getting passwords changed when there shouldn't be so the easiest way is actually when you need a new password is to find one of your co-workers that has admin access and i just have them like go into the user screen and change it to a password that, um, okay. Like then, you know, cause otherwise, otherwise it's going to be, you know, send a form back and forth. Like it's probably easier to call. I don't know. There's two. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, are you John? No, uh, the admin I'm Pete, but the admin is, um, sorry, Alexa, uh, Evans or Alexa Schnauk. schnauck so um okay yeah the admin username does say alexa and yeah there's two usernames that have like permission in the database to change passwords and it's admin and then john john schnauck yeah she's admin so um yeah so i could just get her to go in and and uh change it yeah it's really simple it's like if you can call alexa and she has access to pcr it's it's it takes like a minute uh you just go to a couple couple clicks you go to like the users manage users menu in system and then um she just will like overwrite your password there and hit save and then you should be able to like log in again from the front end you just have to tell her you know what password you want and she has to set it and then yeah that's the that's the fastest way if you want me to send you a password in the form, we can do that. I just... No, no, that's okay. So she doesn't need to know the original one? No. Okay, good. All right, I'll definitely take that route and appreciate your help. Okay. Yeah, I mean, if worse comes to worse, you can call back and we'll send you the password reset form. But yeah, that's just the best, fastest way. Yeah. Do you need... There is a, I think there's like a learning center, PCR learning center. There's like a, what's an article on how to do it on our learning center. So you can go to PCR recruiter.net and then go to the learning center and search for like change password. Yeah. Yeah. If she can't figure out what to do. She knows how to do it. Oh, okay, cool. All right. I'm pretty sure she knows. So that's cool, and I'm doing it now. Great. And somehow... Yeah, sorry, I can't just do it over the phone, but that would be kind of a... No, that makes sense. Yeah. That makes sense, my friend. Anything else, Pete? No, I'm good. I appreciate your help. All right. Yeah, no problem. Have a good holiday. Hey, you do the same. All right. Are you up in Canada? Oh, no, I'm in the States. Oh, okay. I was going to say. I assume all English-speaking humans are American. I probably shouldn't do that anymore, huh? Well, I don't know. I mean, you guys are, aren't you a Canadian company? No, no, we're...
