## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Yes, I'm Mackenzie. My name's Jamie with Management Recruiters of Davidson. How you doing? Hi, Jamie. I'm doing fine. How are you? I'm good, thanks. I'm calling because I'm trying to download the backup that you sent me. Okay. And I'm wondering if you can assist, because when I click on where it says the free version of WinRAR, I don't see anywhere to put a password in. Yeah, that's not the, that wouldn't be where you put the password in. So WinRAR is a program that you're going to have to download and install. So the WinRAR, like the link that brings you to like rarlab.com or whatever, that's a website. And you go to the download section of that website. And let me kind of catch up to that. RAR Lab. Okay, so I'm here on rarlab.com. And when I look to my left, there's a panel on the left side where there's different sections of the website you can go to. And there's downloads. You want to click downloads there. And then it's like the first link in all of the links that it shows you, WinRAR X64. Well, that is assuming you have like a recent, like a sort of recent computer. Do you have like a super old computer? Is it relatively new? It's not super old, so that should work. Okay. Yeah, you have like Windows 10. So it's not the one that says trial? Yeah, you have Windows 10, or are you on a Windows machine? Yes. Okay. So if you're using Windows 10, yeah, it's probably the first one, because you want the 64-bit version. So then you click on WinRAR x64. that's going to download something to your computer. So then you can, it should take not more than 10 seconds to download. You can then, you can go into the downloads folder where that file was downloaded to and you can run that. It's just a free program that will allow you to access your file. So first you have to install this program here by right-clicking. You could run it as an administrator and then you follow like the basic install prompts that you might see for any other program, right? You decide where it goes, and then you install it. And then after you have the WinRAR program, you can then open the files that I sent you. And when you try to open those files, make sure to use the WinRAR program. And when WinRAR tries to open them, then it will prompt you for the password. Okay. Well, I guess you'll go through this whole set of... Yeah, I'll walk you. Oh, I'll sit here with you while you do it. All right. I think it's... I clicked OK. I don't see anything happening, but maybe it's been behind the scenes. I don't know. If you've gone through the WinRAR installer, then you should be able to see when you go to your downloaded database file, you could probably right-click it, and then in your list of options in the right-click menu, you'll see new options that WinRAR is presenting. You can open it with WinRAR, and then it will prompt you for the password. Okay, so it's asking me to install it again. I just did that a second ago. So we'll see what happens. And then okay. And then done. Oh, it says WinRAR has been successfully installed to the folder, blah, blah, blah. That's good. So now where do I go? Okay, so now you just have a program that allows you to open the data return file that I sent you. So now you can go over to the file that you downloaded that I sent you. And you can try to right-click it and open it with and select WinRAR as the program you're trying to open it with. On the link? Or just download one? Well, that link, when you click it, will download a file to your computer. So you want to go to the actual file, like in the downloads folder. Okay. And try and, like, right-click that file and open it with WinRAR. Let's see. Open when done. Always open. Let's see what happens here. It says it's got, like, 20 minutes left. oh um it's uh it sounds like you didn't finish downloading the file uh yeah these files are quite large and sometimes it does take uh take some time so you might want to just kind of monitor that make sure it downloads completely uh and then try to open it yeah um i didn't realize you didn't finish downloading the file yet yeah that would be something i thought i had done that like when you first sent it to me like two weeks ago yeah i don't know where any of this is on the computer sure the default folder that if you download something it just goes to the downloads folder and you could access that downloads folder um if you go to are you are you using google chrome um i am right now yes okay cool in the top right corner there should be like a three dot menu and then you click i see it here it's got one of them installed on june 24th the mr davidson one dot rr oh okay yeah it looks like you already have the file then so try to open that file with the winrar program got it okay yeah you might want to cancel your the download that is currently downloading you don't need two of those well i mean maybe you want two of them if you want to back it up a couple times but um it sounds like y...
