## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received your voicemail that you were having trouble in PCR. Yeah, so it's weird. After you and I talked and we fixed it, I did a roll-up. And it appears that some in the roll-up recorded and some didn't. Okay. And I can't see why. First, I'm out going email. Okay, let's see. I'm going to check. I'm going to log in as you and your database or I'll just do all. This month. Oh, this is strange. It is not showing any sent email campaigns for some reason. What does that mean? Like, so it's saying that I haven't done any emails or? Oh, no, sorry. OK, yeah. Email campaigns isn't turned on for your account. There was a an older feature for just bulk emailing. And that's what comes up when I try to bulk email rather than email campaigns, which you can actually see like open clicks and replies and things. So never mind. What was the roll-up that you sent to? Is it still in the database? Yeah. I should have taken note of specifically which person it was. I did like a random lookup. I think it was – here, let me see if I can find it quickly. Okay. Yeah, I'll just check on a couple name records and see what's going on. So it was, I'm going to listen to Linda and I got to find her again. Sorry, give me one second. No problem. Okay, here's one. Her name is Brianna Combs. And it looks like you can see the rollup was 8-19 at 11-47. Okay. So they were added to the rollup called – oh, it's called blank. Okay. I see that. And then she didn't get recorded. Okay. I'll go to activities. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. So she didn't get recorded. Okay. Okay. And when did you send the email out to Brianna? Do you know a time? The 19th. Let me look her up again. Let's see, because I can... What do you think? 7 p.m. Yeah, I see that in your sent mail, B. Combs at Plunkett T. Cooney. No, not Plunkett T. Cooney. it's um oh it is sorry I take that back it is pumpkin got it okay so yeah I see that in your sent mail and then activities it's not listed there and then if I go to the email it is showing up in your emails tab on the Brianna Combs record just not an What do you mean in my email tab? So if you open up the Brianna Combs name record, there's an emails tab. So it is mapping that it was a sent. Okay. Yeah, I guess when the other recruiters are not going to look at the emails, that's a problem. Right. It should be recording an activity. Let me see here. Preferences, activities, right. Outgoing email activities, yes. Okay, check one other thing here. Okay, and you have for your username, it's turned on to auto-write activities when bulk emailing letters. Okay, so that's already been turned on, that's good. Yeah, I'm not sure why the activity wasn't written. It is connecting with that emails tab, but the emails tab specifically is gonna only show you what your username has sent or received from that person. So even if another team member clicked on the emails tab, it would show a different list of emails. It would be their username's correspondence. So that's not helpful for other users trying to look. But yeah, we really needed to appear in activities. Oh, let me see. No, okay, that's import. I was like, oh, I just saw an 819 activity. Just the word import. Okay, I will, I guess I'll have a tech team member take a look. I'm not exactly sure. But yeah, the emails are going out. They're being recorded as going out in your emails tab, just an activities problem. So I'm not sure what would be causing that. Everything looks set up correctly for your username. I just double checked everything we went over kind of on our last call and everything looks good. So, yeah, let me just get back to you. I'll open up a new ticket and get back to you after I let the tech team take a look. Okay. Yeah, because it's a big issue because more than one person is working on this and they can't see what I've done and I don't have time to go and do each and every one. So I really need to evolve quickly if you can. All right. Yep. I'll let you know as soon as I hear back from the tech team. Now, since I've got you on the phone, can I ask you one other question? Sure. Is there a way you can use PCR capture through LinkedIn? Yeah, the capture tool is built to work with LinkedIn. Absolutely. You would basically just open up the LinkedIn profile and there would be a click to add button that appears on the right and you could capture that person. And that has to be done through phone. It can't be done on Safari or any others. Right. Right. It's only compatible with Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Okay, so can you hold on one second? I'm just going to jump into Chrome because I never use Chrome. I don't even know, actually. I'm pretty sure I got it set up. So if I jump into LinkedIn from Chrome, you're saying that something will show up. If you installed the Chrome browser extension, the PCR capture browser extension, you'll have to ins...
