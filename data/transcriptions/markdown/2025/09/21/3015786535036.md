## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Brian, how are you? Hey, good. How's it going? Good, thanks. Good, good. So you are looking for a data backup, am I correct on that? I know it's been a day or two I was out of town, so I apologize for the delay. Yeah, no, it's all right. I was repeating a request from our new provider, providers, make sure I know what it is. Looking for a full data export of our database. Right. Who are you moving to? LOXO, LOXO. Okay. All right. So, I'm going to send, did anybody send you the data backup form yet? No. Okay. I'm going to do that right now. Just need that form filled out and returned back to us, and we'll have that back up to you probably by the end of the week at the latest. Okay. And how does it come, just out of curiosity? It comes as a link, which you can forward to the new provider and provide them the password. Okay. Yeah, we're going to double dip for a minute, right? We're not, like, leaving PCR tomorrow. But, okay, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. You bet. No problem, Kim. I'll fill out the form as soon as I get it and send it back. Okay. Great. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. Thank you....
