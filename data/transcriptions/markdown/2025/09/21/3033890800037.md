## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Deb Oaks with Whirlbridge Partners. How are you this morning? Good. How are you, Deb? Not too bad. I'm having a little bit of an issue in the company record under names. I can't figure out how to customize a column in there because we switched work emails to let's see I'll switch those to my name record but when I go to the company records it's not showing yeah so with the that names tab let me just verify it follows the same layout as your name record search okay so let me I would be the roll-up wouldn't it no no so which which database are you in I'm in the mr. Boise and I need to get this fixed before I start because I may have to change the way that I'm bringing something in we exported the all the contacts and I'm switching them to this field but if it's not going to work I don't know how to then what's your username in that database deb Oh so So we're using the field in – hold on. How does it show me what that is? Yeah, so if you were doing like a name search, so if you just did like a generic name search, that way out that the results come in where it's like last name, first name, title, company name, email address, all those, The names tab on the company record will follow that name search layout. So if you edit that name search layout, that will reflect in the company records as well. All right. So where do I edit that at? So if you go up to name. Oh, I see it now. And then you'll see a little gear icon on the right-hand side. in that basic search. And where it says searching, you'll have that blank one. Then down under the little magnifying glass in that pop-up window will be the results page. Excuse me. And that's where you can edit that layout. All right. So maybe I need to go and switch the field that I'm putting these in. It's going to be a pain in the butt. all right I thought I was able to start to type of work in which oh they're there okay so this is what I want. Drag this off. Yeah, because it's like I went in there and it's like none of them are showing. I'm like, what's going on? And I thought I had fixed this all before I copied it over to the other users and now I don't know how I'm going to... Is there a way that I can copy just... I don't want to set this off to the IT users, so I'm going to have to probably call them and have them manually add it in themselves, or I'm going to have to switch the field that we're doing it in. So when you do the copy, like the copy settings under name, company, position records, it switches the record and the search layouts. So when you do the copy, you would just select name, and that'll change the, like make it so everybody has the same record and search layout. Right, but if they've gone, because I did this to them once already and I'm afraid if I were to go and do something again, they're going to get ticked at me. Like, what did you do? My frame is offset again. I think I'll have to just manually have them fix that in their results so they don't lose anything else. Yeah, if they want their results to be a specific way, they would just need to add that in there so that it shows on the company under the names tab on the company record. Oh, yeah, there they are. The problem is we have all these different work email fields. We have work email, email work, email underscore work. I'm like, oh my God, who created all these things? So my guess, what usually happens with those is that email work is like one of those comes loaded in the database custom fields but when you do an import to a custom field if they had it labeled incorrectly in their spreadsheet when doing an import it'll create a custom field if it didn't already exist in database. So I mean that's probably where you ended up with some extra work emails because they didn't adjust it properly before doing an import. Okay all right yeah this is going to be a problem if I don't because right now they're probably not seeing emails. I don't think they're seeing emails on their team. Hold on. Let's go to this one and see. I got to make sure my dog's not barking at a turkey vulture again. Not a problem. My dog barks at everything and anything. Yeah, well, I'm coming in and attacking her, so I don't see it. I don't think it would come after her because she's a good size, but you never know if it's hungry enough. Yeah. All right. It looks like that works. I just got to rethink how I'm going to fix this going forward because I don't. All right. Yeah. We're almost ready to do the re-import of fixing the emails. Because right now they have a mixture of work and personal emails in the email address field. So I'm trying to separate it out so that when they go and they do their, you know, they do mass emails, they can just pull the one field and they don't have to go and look through everything to make sure they're pulling the right email address to email the person. It makes sense. Yeah. If you have any ...
