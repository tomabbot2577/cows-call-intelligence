## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There are two participants in the meeting. Good afternoon, Linda. Do you hear me? Good morning, Linda. Do you hear me? Jim? Yeah. Are you there? Yeah. Am I the only one on? You are. You should be. Do you have other people on here? No. No. Is the iPhone X Max you? I couldn't hear you. I couldn't hear you when I went and heated up my coffee. So I didn't know you had come on. So I apologize. I haven't seen anything. No problem. No, I dialed in the first time and there was only this iPhone X Max showing. Is that you? The what? There's an iPhone X Max showing. You know what? It could have been because what happened, the ceiling fell on my head in my office, the sheetrock. Oh, no. On Friday. And they're fixing it now. So I'm using like a first day signed into my laptop, but my husband had set up my desktop, just gotten it done. So my laptop wasn't allowing me to get in and wasn't showing me that I had the appointment because one's a Mac and one's an Apple. And I guess they just didn't talk to each other. So, you know, I know I have this at 10 o'clock. so I apologize. No problem. I've been in and the first time a couple of times the number wouldn't take my password for Zoom so Zoom was having issues too and I tried to direct a couple of times so you have a couple of messages for me but no problem. I'm glad we're here. Okay, sorry. Not a problem. So yeah, so we're going to take a look at the PCRM today to look at that sales pipeline and take a look at that too. I want to enlarge this but I guess you'll do that, right? well let me see I'm going to share my screen here on pause it and you should be looking at my sign-in screen to PCRM right now and I think it's as big as I can make it unless I zoom in once we log in okay so let me get logged in here okay So this is the PCRM. Do you see my screen okay? Oh yeah, totally different. Yeah, so kind of the biggest thing what we've done is this new user interface for the PCRM product. And we've taken, and instead of having them the menu across the top, we put the menu down the left-hand side. So You're still going to see some of the same things, like you still have names, companies, positions, roll-ups. A lot of those are going to be the same terminology, and they do the same thing. There are a few new buttons, like the deals workflow, which we'll take a look at there. But the biggest difference, too, when I click a name – What about resumes? Because I always want the resume to be in that choice selection. Easiest way to tab through resumes is if you go into somebody's record and you look at their resume. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. But I mean, mine is way in the back where I have to scroll over and then hit. Well, your resume. So the resumes are going to be. Hold on one second, Jim. I think so. Yeah. Sorry about that. They're doing some work in the office because of. The roof was caved in. I have a concussion and everything. It just completely cemented the lumps in my head. So I apologize. No, no, I'm glad you're okay. What caused it? Did it just fail? or i'm not they're looking for but it was just i had to move floors because somebody helped move all my stuff because it was just so hot it was you know 98 degrees pouring heat right through this directly at my desk and chair so but it was a huge hole it was like oh but no cracks no no warning. So we'll go back to this. This is a name record. But when you open PC Recruiter now, what would it look like? Well, this would be, so this would be PCRM. So remember PC Recruiter 9 isn't going anywhere. This is just a different log on to your same database. So if you log on through PCRM, you could go back tomorrow and log back on under PCR9. And so you're going to have both and eventually maybe you find that you like this and only want to use this that's up to you but this is going to give you this new interface so that if I wanted to I could create a custom workspace nice thing I can do is I can put a little version of the resume right on the front screen like you'll see I have the resume shown on the right half of the screen here so I can go through here and I can set up a custom workspace here showing whatever I want then I have areas where I can look at only the resume or if I have multiples I can have different tabs at the top here and look at multiple copies of a resume or I can look at his pipeline or I can look at his attachments or anything like that so the same stuff just a different view looking at this version of PCRecruiter okay so that's going to give me so a little bit of different configuration options there. I also am going to have, so you see a lot of these things are the same. I have names, companies, positions, roll-ups, all of that. But the deals workflow is going to be kind of your sales pipeline, which is something new that's been added to the PCRM product. What is it called? You're exuberant. The deals pipe...
