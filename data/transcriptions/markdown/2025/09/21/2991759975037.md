## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Thank you for calling Eric Wald.

**[0:01] Speaker_01:** Please hold while I try to connect you.

**[0:22] Speaker_00:** Good morning.

**[0:24] Speaker_00:** This is Eric.

**[0:25] Speaker_01:** Good morning, Eric.

**[0:26] Speaker_01:** It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter.

**[0:28] Speaker_01:** I got your inquiry through our website.

**[0:30] Speaker_01:** Thought I'd give you a quick call.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** Hey, let me tell somebody I'll call them right back.

**[0:37] Speaker_00:** Sure.

**[0:41] Speaker_00:** Hey, Dean.

**[0:43] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** I'm going to have to call you back.

**[0:50] Speaker_00:** All right.

**[0:51] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:53] Speaker_01:** Oh, I'm doing very well.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** I'm doing very well.

**[0:54] Speaker_01:** You good?

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** Excellent.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** Well, listen, I'm with Sanford Rose and I've been a PCR for some time.

**[1:07] Speaker_00:** I am looking at trying to find a tool that will help us with the business development aspect of it.

**[1:14] Speaker_00:** And Brian Denton, our IT guy at SRA, had said, hey, have you looked at PCRM?

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** like what the hell is PCRM?

**[1:24] Speaker_00:** So I looked and I found PCRM and that's why I booked a call.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** Excellent.

**[1:31] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[1:32] Speaker_01:** It's our new CRM product.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** And the cool thing about it is it's a separate CRM, but it runs off of the same technology, the same database as PC Recruiter.

**[1:42] Speaker_01:** So it enables you to share the database.

**[1:43] Speaker_01:** So you could actually use PCRM for your marketing purposes and PCR9, which you use now for recruiting, or maybe you eventually start using PCRM for everything.

**[1:53] Speaker_01:** So it's kind of designed to maybe be its own standalone product someday, but right now it basically does everything PCR9 does, but adds a sales pipeline, simpler sequencing, some different things like that.

**[2:06] Speaker_00:** So yeah, I'd like to see more of the functionality of it.

**[2:11] Speaker_00:** I've been looking at Crelate.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** I've looked at CPAL.

**[2:16] Speaker_00:** I'm really leaning more towards Crelate than CPAL simply because they have that business development aspect where it'll go out and search for open positions and notify me in the ATS.

**[2:29] Speaker_00:** Does PCM have any of that aspect or is it just keeping track of those deals?

**[2:35] Speaker_01:** just keeping track it doesn't have any technology to go find open positions or anything like that so it's just going to be basically a deals pipeline so you can use like yeah but it looks different but it works a little bit different to track a deal a potential relationship with a new client okay all right and then what is the what charges are different than what I pay now what it does it it adds It's $10 to your user, so it takes you from, I think, $50 to $60.

**[3:06] Speaker_01:** And then it's $3.50 one time to set it up.

**[3:09] Speaker_01:** And that $3.50 turns it on, creates that second link, and includes four hours training.

**[3:14] Speaker_01:** So you get trained up on the new system, and it just shares the existing database.

**[3:18] Speaker_01:** So you can still use PCR9 and PCRM sharing the same database.

**[3:23] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:25] Speaker_00:** Yeah, I'd like to learn more about it.

**[3:27] Speaker_00:** I mean, I think the deal pipeline would certainly be a benefit for us to analyze the business and have an understanding of the funnel automated.

**[3:36] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, I'd like to see more information about it and I'll bring it to my team.

**[3:43] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[3:43] Speaker_01:** Let's maybe pick a time tomorrow or Thursday that we could run through a demo, maybe 20 minutes or so.

**[3:50] Speaker_01:** When I send you the invite, I'll also send the website for the PCRM product as well.

**[4:06] Speaker_01:** And I'm pretty open tomorrow other than 1 p.m.

**[4:09] Speaker_01:** Eastern.
