## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSeries Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, this is Ernie Bivona. How are you? Good. How are you? Fine, thank you. Is there a way of looking for companies in the database where there's been an activity within the last, let's say, 15 years, 20 years? In other words, my database goes back to the 1980s. So if there's been nothing going on since, you know, in 10 years or 15 years, there's no point in talking to them. They may have moved on, who knows, whatever. But in seeking live bodies, if you will, is there a way of identifying their activity in the lab? Because I looked. I don't see where I can see that, do that. So we can do like an advanced search that says the last activity is greater than this date or less than this date. You would probably want, let's see, like less than meaning in the past from a certain date. So if you're saying maybe 10 years back. I know, but where would I do that? It doesn't say under predefined fields, company, city, state, country, industry, specialty, email address, notes, keywords, summary, profile, attachments. I don't see activity. It would be called last – oh, you found it? No. I'm saying in candidates, yeah, but not in companies. not in company okay let me check on that are you in the consumer or industrial database industrial we do not use consumer haven't used it in 30 years got it all right we will log in on my end we should get rid of it we if you did want to do that we could put in a request with the tech team to remove a database if you want it, totally fine. I mean, it hasn't been touched in decades, so whatever information is there is going to be pretty much worthless. Gotcha, okay. And just logging in now, my internet connection must be slow today. It's taken a really long time, sorry. let's see company advanced search and look for okay it might be do this customer I see what's happening so with company searches you've customized your search to only show specific fields in that drop-down instead of all available fields so we can either switch that and add in last activity as an option or we can clear it so that you have any field imaginable as an option when using your search drop downs so to do that just go the top right are you on a search right now like an independent I'm on the top we're not there yet let me get let me I got that's going to be the purpose of it course let me let me get to the where I can do this and then we can and then we'll export where you create a role perfect whatever okay so if you're on go the company in the main menu at the top and then there'll be in your action menu top right a gear icon that says customize you'll have a new pop-up window that appears on the left it will say available field on the right it'll say selected fields so those selected fields are the only ones that are showing up in your search drop downs. So you can add last activity from available fields and move it over to selected fields or you can clear out all of the selected fields, leave that blank, so that every field is available to you when you perform company searches. Well, hold on. I went up to the top. I saw activities. Oh, no, you want to go to company in the main menu at the top of PCR. And then at the top right are a handful of icons. One of them is a gear icon in the action menu. It says customize. Hold on. Learning center, user preferences, background test start, change my password. Oh, it's a gear icon a little bit lower than that gear icon you clicked on. Database, data management, global change, web extensions, employer websites, database menu. Oh, yeah, that one's in the main menu. So you want to jump back over to company in the main menu. Go to company and click search. And then at the top right, there's an action menu. It has like a question mark, a gear icon, a magnifying glass. The one you want is the gear icon in that set of icons. Okay. So now we want to what? So, yeah, the selected fields on the right, if you clear those out, it'll make sure that every field is available to you when you perform a search. Right now you only have those ten fields available to you when you're performing a company search. So how do I clear them? Just hit the minus sign to the right of each one, and that'll remove it from selected fields. And once that's empty, just hit save at the bottom right. Then we'll be able to use last activity as part of our search. Then what's going to happen when I want to go back to do the last activity? So, yeah, while you're just still on this page where you have available fields and selected fields, just make sure selected fields is empty and then hit save and then you can close it. Oh, good. Okay, then we could go. You want to go to your company advanced search. I know. Now I close this and I go to Company, Advanced Search. Perfect. And then you want the predefined fields as your first dropdown. In the second drop down you can now choose last activity. Last modified? No, it should be l...
