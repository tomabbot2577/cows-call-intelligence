## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling eTech High. If you know your party's extension number, you may dial it at any time. For the operator, please press 0. eTech High, this is Chrissy. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail that you have some questions about PCR. Yes. Hi, Garrett. Thanks for calling me back. No problem. I'm trying to work in PCR, and all I've ever done is actually use PCR to send out roll-ups with a CSV imported. I've never worked with the actual database in there in order to send a roll-up out to existing database contacts. And so I'm kind of in the dark on how to find what I'm looking for in PCR. And I'm not, like, totally inexperienced in it, but I can't figure out, like, with our companies. I'm trying to find, like, we have, like, three different categories, but I don't know how to find those categories. I just know they exist because everybody who used to work in this is gone. Oh, I see. Okay. I haven't been able to get formal training with any processes. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, let me pull up your database really quick. So usually you can categorize. Let's see. You can categorize records with certain field level data. So, you know, anybody with the first name Mike, I could do a search and find field level things like that. Or there's other tabs on records, things like keywords that make them more searchable later on. Other softwares might call them tags. So if you do, do you know of like an example of a categorization that you're looking for? So we, I have one thing in a manual that is the only reference to this kind of thing. It says categories and companies and it says default company and then there's available client company and vendor. Oh, okay. That is a specific. Yeah, that makes sense. So, yeah, there's a specific field on every company record, and it's called the default company type. And there's those four options. The client company is a way to, when you select that, you're designating this company record as one of your clients. You're actively, you know, filling job orders for them. when it's more of a company record in your database that you maybe plan to reach out to and don't have a relationship with yet you switch that over to available and then vendor is more like you just want their contact in your database but they're maybe providing a service for you so it could be like our company main sequence is your software provider so maybe we'll be in your database as a vendor and then default company that one's special in pcr you should only have one company record designated as your default company and you probably already have one in your database i could check to see what it's called right now but it's kind of just like a catch-all um where you know every name record in pcr has to be attached to a company record so if they don't have a company to go to you put them in to the default database it's generally how you would do default is like everybody and then under that they could be these three Heather categories we were talking about well defaults kind of separate separate from the other three so you'll only have one company that's listed as your default that's your catch-all company that names can go to but the other three yeah it just depends are they a client or not okay so I see the categories under basic search and like so we're saying in theory available should just be non non-client clients okay so that yeah that makes sense because that's 6600 entries and then if I go I don't know how to go back do I go back or do I just hit company again you can hit company again if you hit basic search underlined it'll retain your criteria so you don't have to start over building out your search or you can hit company at the top if you want to just start over fresh okay so in here just so you know what I'm looking at in case you're not actively in my little database here under default company I have available default client and vendor so they created a category under default company called default company yeah the name the The name of the field is default company type, but maybe the word type is getting cut off. Okay. But, yeah, that's like a standard thing that comes with PCR, that specific field. Yeah, and I looked at it, and it says there's 17. So that's probably not something we were actively using per se. Oh, okay. Yeah, you should really only have one default company. So maybe those got switched at some point over to default accidentally, some of those 17. I just pulled open your database here. Oh, yeah. So you do have one company called Candidate Pool. That's a common name people will give for their default company because it's just a general candidate pool where people sit when they have no other company to be associated with in your database. I think the other companies besides Candidate Pool should eventually be switched to something like Available or even Client if they're a client. I don't know I don't see anywhere to go to candidates where do you see...
