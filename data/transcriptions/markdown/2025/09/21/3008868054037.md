## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Scott Shapiro over at Stago Solutions in Charlotte. I am having issues with DCR capture. Okay. What kind of issue are you having with it? So I click on DCR capture and it's asking me to log in, and I click log in and nothing happens. Okay. When you click on the extension, is it prompting you for the URL? The URL is already populated. Okay. Does it end in my company? Yes. Okay. So what you need to do is if you bring up your PCR login page, copy that entire URL. Right. Okay. Yeah. Let me know when you've done that. Oh, is it after I log in or prior to logging into PCOS? Prior to logging in. Because that link that you see that ends in my company, that's just an example of what it's looking for. So what you need to do is copy your URL and then paste it into that field. And it doesn't let you just edit. You've got to actually copy the link and paste it in. It's not even allowing me to – oh, there it is. Okay. Yeah, sometimes it's kind of more at the left. You got to click in the field. Yeah, okay. And that says, okay, so. Okay, let me see now. Okay. Okay. Yeah, no, it's funny because a lot of people did normal and anomaly mixed up, but not ESOP-cannibal . Okay, so now it's asking me to, for the psh capture now, it's asking me to put in my username and password. So I have to manually put that in? Yes, that one, that part you can manually put in. Okay, but then going forward, will I always have to manually put it in or? No, it's just like a one-time setup. Okay. Basically, you're telling the capture how to connect to your database and then how to Yeah. Hold on. Let me... I haven't had to put in the password in a long time. Let me see. I think I know what it is, but let me just... So, this is really focused on the DPI . And, you know, it would be probably like all of these codes, pretty big patch. I mean, it has some reps and some full platform reps in the common use code. But, you know, other than probably get to . do you have access to tons of business on the deal size would probably be sufficient all our students act as it's both interesting but those things will have to be a lot faster and give you some real opportunity to kind of get a lot of deals the pipeline enclosed and you know on. We probably would do it. We would take one. Some deals are in other products. So yeah, it's definitely a good idea to kind of go Okay, so now it came up. I logged in and it says at the top capture to the left, match to the right, and it looks like everything, LinkedIn Recruiter, everything is checked off to the right. It's on. the one you might want to watch though is the at the bottom right of that pop up where it says capture the default company do you want everybody to go and just go into your default company or do you want to try to get the company I want to try to get the company so try to so uncapture that yeah so slide that off you know I would right okay and then you should be all set Okay, so let me just see now. Okay, so now I'm in LinkedIn. I'm at a client, I'm at a candidate's profile. And, oh, so then just click on the top left, just click on capture. No, it should be... Or a match. No, it should be... You won't click on the extension at all. When you load up the page, you should see the extension pop up at the right, about halfway down, and it'll either say click to add or click to update. I'm not... Yeah, I don't have it. It's not appearing. You're in a person's profile? Yeah. Try reloading the page. If you go up at the top left, it's got that circle with the arrow. Try reloading which page? The person's profile that you're on. On LinkedIn? Mm-hmm. Yeah, and you have to go into the person. I'll have to just check with my boss on the OCD. And unfortunately, I do have a call. Oh, yeah, I say that. I say that. Click to update. Yeah, then do that. And there it is. And you'll want to be very careful about picking, if it's an existing record, picking the existing. And if you want to keep them in the same company, like if it found a duplicate company, make sure you hover on that card and then check the checkbox. Otherwise, if you just advance without doing that, you're creating a new person or a new company. Right. Okay, so... I think that's going to be great. I'm ready to get this over to our chat. And I do have a call that's scheduled for 1030. So if we need more time, I'm going to have to give you a call back after that call. Well, hey, thanks for your time, and we'll stay in touch. Okay, so to click on the client's name and how do I Did it find the company of the match? Yes, and click on and then hit review. No, hover on the company and then hit the little checkbox. Yeah, hit the checkbox. And then hit review. And then hit review. So that way you're not creating a new company, you're just picking the existing. Right, and then hit submit. Got it, okay. all set awesome all right yeah thank you all righty have a great week thank you awesome bye...
