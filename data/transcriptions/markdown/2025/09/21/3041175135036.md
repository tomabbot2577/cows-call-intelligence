 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. Neil Marshall. Hey, Neil. How are you? I'm doing good thanks for that self I'm all right I am all right glad we could connect today yes I wanted to wanted to talk a little bit about what you're looking for in a software package what you're using now what's working what's not working and see how I can help if we'd be a fit and I have allowed time to take you through a demo if you wish or we could schedule a different time if that works better that's all on you but just wanted to uh kind of see what you're looking for? Can I open the dialogue? Sure. So let me tell you this story, Jim. And I'm going to go and maybe give you some details that won't seem pertinent at first, but I think as we evolve, I think it'll end up being pertinent. So we started HealthSearch Partners about eight years ago. It was actually three firms that came together to form Health Search Partners. Two of us rolled our firms into Health Search Partners. One of them, Faith Search Partners, just moved their healthcare practice into Health Search Partners and kept their faith practice separate and as a going concern. FaithSearch then became our back office. They did all of our database work, billing, collect. I mean, all of the back office stuff was done by FaithSearch partners. Fast forward eight years, we've decided to split from FaithSearch and so we will be needing our own database solution. The split comes November the 11th and so we'll need our own solution and up and running by then. FaithSearch, the solution that we've used has been Salesforce, but we will not be moving forward with Salesforce. Okay. For a variety of reasons. If you'd like the reasons, and I don't know that I can articulate them, except that to me, Salesforce is a big, I don't know, it's like a big Ferrari, right? It goes 200 miles an hour, but it breaks down. It needs a whole team of people to keep it going. And we need something that'll get us from A to Z at 70 miles an hour, not 200. And we need something that we don't need a team of people to keep it running. Okay, excellent. And what do you use right now as an ATS? Anything? No, Salesforce. Oh, Salesforce for everything. All your tracking and everything is done in Salesforce. Yeah, yeah. Okay. But I will also say that, you know, we're an executive search firm, Jim. We're not a, you know, we don't have 10,000 open requisitions or anything like that. I mean, we've got eight or 10 at any given time. We're less about the applicant tracking and more about the database management, if you will. Although, you know, having an applicant tracking system that works really well and is really intuitive and, you know, is built kind of for that executive search function would not be bad. Okay, okay. And are you looking for what basic main features are you looking for in the software? What are the main problems you need for it to solve? I think the first is a place to house our database. Number two, a function that we can easily manipulate such to come up with a group of candidates that we can send solicitations to and then track the progress intuitively through to the end. Perfect, perfect. Excellent. Are you looking for any back office at all? Billing or invoicing or anything like that? I'm sorry, to do what? Billing, invoicing, anything like that? Are you looking for anything? Not really. I mean, we do all of that kind of, you know, by hand, and there's not a whole lot of it, you know. Excellent, excellent. And are you looking to convert any Salesforce data? Are you looking to take a copy of the database, convert it into something new? Yes. Okay. And that is up on 11.11, or is it you're separating the companies as of 11.11? I'm not sure I understand the distinction. Does your sales force have a drop-dead date? Do you have a contract end date that sales force goes away? No. But November 11, our access to it will go away through this other firm. Perfect. So they're keeping it, and you'll – okay, so you're done then. Right. Good. Okay. And about how many people would you have utilizing a system? Eight to ten. Okay. Perfect. Hey, Jim, out of curiosity, are you going to be up on camera, or am I talking to your white name the whole time? No, I am in here. I will pop it on now. Yeah, for sure. I normally don't keep it on when I'm doing a demo, which is mostly what I do, but I'll pop it back on now for sure. I've gotten to the point where I like to know who I'm talking to. Oh, for sure. Yeah, usually I'm just doing a demo, so I'm looking down, taking notes, and rather than look at the top of my head, that's why I leave it off by default, but I turn it on. I'm not averse to turning it on at all. Good. Okay, so 8 to 10 users, I know that time frame. Did you want to take a look around a little bit at ...
