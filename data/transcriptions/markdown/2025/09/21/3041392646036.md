## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. My name's Wyatt Cole. So our account manager, Jim Lombardo, I reached out to him yesterday to ask about how I can get email campaigns and sequencing. And he said it's already included in our database. and you know may just need to find them and hide the icons and everything i mean i i uh i still can't figure out how to how to get to it so um i don't know if it's like i'm trying to follow the steps you know um to uh you know go to system and then manage users and then the security part i I just don't see under the other heading, I don't see the sequence a drop down. Oh, let me check here. So you said you were in user settings and your username is Wyatt, right? Yes. Okay, let's see here. Other placements, presentations, Yeah, I'm not seeing that either. It is part of your package to have. I just checked in our files that you should have analytics, sequencing campaigns inside your database here. It doesn't look like those things are available. All right. All right. So, yeah, let me open up a ticket with our tech team and we're going to have them turn all that on for you. So, yeah, it is part of your package. Like Jim said, I'm glad he verified that. And I'll open up a ticket and have our tech team turn that on. OK. What is your best email address to get a hold of you when it's complete? Wyatt at MedTechES.com. MedTechES.com. OK, perfect. Yeah, I'll let them know and we'll get that turned on as quickly as possible. Cool. All right. Well, I'd be notified when it's on, like an email or something, like a closed ticket. Yeah, exactly. I'll send you an email letting you know it's complete and then we'll close out the ticket. Cool. Awesome. All right. Thank you so much. Thanks. Take care. Take care....
