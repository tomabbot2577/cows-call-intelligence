## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks, Tyler. Main sequence technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is Ryan at KBassman. Hey, Ryan. How's it going? Hey, good, man. How are you? Doing good. Doing good. Living the dream? Oh, yeah. Yeah? I hear that. Hey, I've got some GESG. It's Global Executive Search Group. They are sending emails using PCR through a SendGrid connection, and they're complaining because the bottom of their email says powered by PC Recruiter. And they want to know how to remove that. Oh, for the bulk mails? Yeah, we can do that on our end. We have to just put in a ticket for it. Okay. Will you do that for me, please? Yeah. And I can give you their OBDC. Give me two seconds. Oh, for Donka? Yes That's actually exactly who put in the ticket so I'm kind of weirded out that you knew that Alright I don't really know why they have a problem with it, but she's complaining about it, so I figured I'd ask. Yeah, a lot of people, because we can just have it replaced with a transparent image. Gotcha. Which email address did she use? Was it globalesg.com or just gesg.com? the one that she sent me was GESG.com and it was L. Wayne Scott's the one that she sent me as a reference but it would be for all of them yeah so when we do that remove that image it's for the entire ODBC okay so just so she's aware of that. Yeah, that's fine. No, she's good with that. And then you said it's replaced with a transparent image, so does that add a space at the bottom of the email? No, no, no, no. Okay. That's the image that we use for tracking. Like clicks, opens, things like that. Got it. all emails. Alright. Do you want me to CC you on this ticket as well? Yeah, no problem. That way you can know exactly when it's done. Yes, sir. That would be awesome. just right at next level exchange.com right yep that'll work All right. So I just created that ticket. I just have to tag a senior tech in it to have them go in and change that. But then as soon as it's done, I'll follow up with you and Donka on that ticket. Cool. I appreciate it very much. Yep. No problem. If you need anything else, just let us know. Thanks. Have a good one. Bye....
