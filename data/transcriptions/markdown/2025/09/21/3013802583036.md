## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Team Sequence. I'm Heather. Oh hello this is David again. I just talked to you a few minutes ago. Fixing all my problems today. What else we got? I so I'm in the PC recruiter view and Outlook and when I am clicking on like a LinkedIn redirect it sends me to I think it's Microsoft Edge, which I don't use for a redirect. Is there a way to set the default to just the default browser? Because if I do it in regular PC Recruiter, it defaults to a regular Chrome browser. So what Outlook does, I believe, is they're just going to assume. That's what I figured, yeah. They're going to call their own program. Now, if I remember right, I wasn't able to do it. Let me just figure out where I did it. I'm pretty sure I've done it on mine. I always feel like it's a weird. Some kind of setting somewhere. Okay. In your Windows search, type the. Wait. Choose file apps and protocols. Open by each app. I feel like it's something else. Okay. Type the word protocol in the Windows search area. Mm-hmm. And then do you get choose a default app for each protocol, the system setting? Choose a default app for each link type. Choose file types and links open by each app. Set default app. No. Okay. What comes up as the first one? The first one is set a default app. Hmm. I wonder if they changed the language in different versions of office. So basically, like, there's, like, HTML, and then it's going to go to – you could set it, or maybe it's HTTP, because I have mine set to Chrome. I'm just looking. What is the link that you're opening? Is it, like, HTTP? It's a LinkedIn URL, www.linkedin.com. Okay. What were the other choices? How were they worded on yours? With protocol. So I get... Oops. I get set a default app. choose a default app for each link type, set your default programs, choose file types and links open by each app. I'd have to see it. Let's do a screen share. Hold on one second. You're getting different choices than I am. So let me see here. I'm on RingCentral too if it's easier to share through that. Oh, I can do RingCentral, yeah. Okay. I was about to send you a Google meeting, but let's see. Okay, if you can open up your RingCentral app, go to video and then click join. Okay. And then it's going to ask you for a meeting ID? Yep. nine four eight one zero. Okay. Okay so at the bottom of your screen if you can hit share, but make sure you select to show your entire screen. Okay. Okay, let me bring you over to my bigger screen. Okay, so let's go ahead and go to Outlook. Okay, so can you go down the bottom of your computer where you type protocol there. Okay maybe it's just maybe it is that choose a default f for each link type. Let's try that one. Finds word of difference. Okay go down to where I'm I guess for HTTP, HTTPS, this is what I did on mine. Unless they just changed it all together. Okay. And you want it to open in Chrome? I want it to open in Chrome, yeah. Yeah, that's what it's set to do here. Okay. I don't use Microsoft Edge. Can I just uninstall it, or is it going to cause problems with other Microsoft? It could possibly. I would keep it in there because it is a Microsoft product. Can you show me what it is you're doing? Let me see if I can. Yeah. So, like, if I'm in a profile, if I do it within the portal when I'm already in Chrome, it pulls it up fine and where was I over here trying to do I just pulled it up in judges. Can you maximize this window? I'm not even seeing the options there. No. Got it now? Okay, that's odd. Okay, let's see. HTTPS. Okay, let's exit out of here for a moment. I want to try something different. If you just go to LinkedIn field instead of using that shortcut, does it open different that way? So like underneath your home phone field? Because you were in the sidebar at the left, right? Yeah. Oh, right here you mean? Yeah, let me see what happens here. Yeah, same thing. That's where I did it initially. I didn't know it made a difference. Okay. What is this actually in now here? What is this? It's weird. You don't even get... I was going to say I don't even get a drop down. Hmm. Okay. Let me... Yeah, this is some other setting. I've got to figure out what's going on here. Okay. Why does yours not even show anything? What was that pop-up? I think that's just the LinkedIn prompt because I'm not logged in. But it will show you everything if you're a logged in user. And I'm not logged in through this browser. Hmm. Okay. What if you hit sign in? I'm going to see what it actually does if you're signed in. Can you hit try to continue with Google, I guess, option? Oh, I don't even know my Google account. Can you go right over to Google, maybe? We're just in a new browser? Yeah, I just want to see something here. Okay, so you see all of that there. Why would it not do it from the other place though? Okay. Let's see. Okay, it's kind of this. If you click on apps and then click on default apps. Okay. Scroll down to the bottom and select choose links by link or choose defaults by l...
