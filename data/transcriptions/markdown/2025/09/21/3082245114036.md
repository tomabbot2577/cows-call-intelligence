## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling in today. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Can you hear me? Yeah. So, Garrett, I just have a question here. I just want to understand more about duplicate email addresses. Because I just sent out our newsletter in PTR, and then after I sent it, there's like a prompt that I have 33 were duplicate email addresses, 32 have opted out. Now when I click that 33 duplicate email, I don't see any duplicate emails here. So how does it work, that duplicate email addresses? Oh, it might be that you have resend checking turned on when you're sending out your bulk email and what that'll do is check to see if that email address has received the form letter that you're sending in the past. And if it has, it'll say this is a duplicate email address. There's a feature called resend checking that you might have turned on or it might be on by default for your username. But basically it checks to see if any of those email addresses have received that form letter before. And if it has, it won't send it again. It'll call it a duplicate email address. So even if this is a different form letter, they will not... If it's a different form letter, then you can send it with resend checking. But if resend checking is turned on, it won't send the same form letter to the same person twice. Where can I see that? Sorry, what's the term? Resend checking? Yeah, let me take a look. I'll pull up your database. What's your name and what company are you with? My name is Karen and I'm with Targeted Recruiting Group. Okay, Targeted Recruiting Group. My user is Kate Cowan. Okay. Let me just, under your username. Can you still hear me? I think something cut out on my audio. Oh, good. Okay, sorry. All right, so I just logged in. I'm going to check. So if I go to like a roll-up and go to send a bulk email, I'll check to see what the default is for resend checking. One second here. Select some names. Where's the mail icon? And then optional. Does that apply to all bulk email that I'm sending? Or just for a specific campaign? Yeah. So it depends on if you turn that setting on or off for each email campaign you send. So, for example, if you go to send a new email campaign, like maybe just open up a roll-up list and select a few names and then hit the letter icon to start sending an email campaign. And I'll show you where the option is for resend checking. Let me know when you're there. Yeah, I'm here now. Okay. On the left. On the left. Oh, sure. So are you seeing where it says create new campaign or use existing campaign? Yes. Uh-huh. So I did. Okay. Then on. Here is create new campaign. Good. Okay. And then on the left, if you go to options, which is a gear icon, you'll see the option for resend checking. And you have it by default set to be turned on where the selected form letter only, if it was sent to somebody in the last 60 days, it will not send again. So that might be why you had those duplicates listed. Did not resend letter only. So if it's the same form letter, I understand it correctly. it will not be sent to the same recipient, right? Right, right. But you can turn that off if you want them to receive it more than once. But this is a different form letter. I created like a new form letter for this, and then it's also a new campaign. Oh, okay. So your recommendation for this one, Garrett, whether this should be turned on or should be turned off. I would turn it off if you plan to send the same form letter to the same people. But if it was a different form letter that you have never sent before, I'll check the list of people that you sent. Maybe there would be something to do with duplicates there. I'm not sure. Was it a roll-up that you sent? The email too? That's monthly newsletter. I see 1861 okay. So I have the list here now. Okay so if I turn this off now I can resend the newsletter to this 33 just to get email address right? It should be able to. Let me double check here your background tasks. I want to make sure that it went out. One second. Okay so So it says that it is currently running. Yeah, 49%. OK. And let me see where it says not sent next to any name here. OK, I found one not sent. In PDR. Is there a delimiter? I mean, in the limiter, right? Yeah, just in sequencing. But not in any other. Okay. No, it's only in sequencing. Here, let me find. There's a person listed here on page. Oh, I just lost it. Which page was that on? Somebody had not sent next to their name. Let me try to find that again, sorry. Sure. Pick it up, William. Okay, there we go. Morgan C. Okay. Okay, so we have Logan C. I'm looking at newsletter. Oh, I see. Okay, so one of the examples, I think I know what's going on. One of the examples was the email address, Crandall OJ. so C-R-A-N-D-A-L-O-J at gmail.com that is listed on two records in your database there's two Logans that share that email address both of those Logans are on your monthly newsletter roll up so it wouldn't be able to send to both those people because they...
