## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Ginny. Good morning, Ginny. Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm good, Jim. How are you doing? Real well. Real well. I just had a quick question. I was getting ready to put in the ticket to have the premium and AI Plus and PCR and all of that added. And I noticed you have two databases. Which one do you work in or do you work in both? I guess for right now, let's just use the old one, the SRA Beachwood, I guess, is what it's called. SRA Beachwood. Okay. Yeah, because I've been meaning to switch over to this other database. I haven't been able to do it yet. Okay, so you're going into the Gartner group eventually? Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, eventually I want to go into the Gartner group, yeah. But I just haven't – yeah, I've had too many other things going on to do that. Cool. That's good that you're going to be using both. I'll make sure they're both ready to be used alongside PCRM. So that would be all good. But I just want to make sure – sometimes somebody doesn't use one, so we don't need to upgrade that one. But I'll get everything set up. Yeah, does that make a big difference? I mean, I just... No, no. Okay, good. All right, good. Probably going to be all right. Yeah, they just might guys have to make sure both of those are on the premium package so that they would be compatible and share the data with PCRM. Okay. All right, no, that's fine. That's great. And then you'll send me a note about the training? Yeah. Yeah, what will happen, I'll put in a ticket today. They'll add the new feature. They will send you the link to the PCRM, let you know everything's there, and then they'll toggle that over to the training team. A trainer will then be able to get something set up. Okay. I have to reset up my PCR Outlook add-in, so I guess I can do that with them when they do that as well. Yeah, mention that. Yeah, the trainer can help with that, sure. Okay, great. Thank you so much, Jim. Not a problem. All right, have a great day. Have a good day. All right, bye-bye. Bye....
