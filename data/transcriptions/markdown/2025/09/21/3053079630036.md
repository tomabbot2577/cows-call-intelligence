## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. May I help you? Hi there. I was calling to see if I could get some assistance getting my training set up. Oh, are you a new user or a new account with us? Yes, new user. Okay. What is your name and what is the name of your company? Okay, it's Callie, C-A-L-L-I-E, last name Walker, and the company is Summit Employment Professionals. Okay, one second here. All right. So I will check to see if there's a training ticket already started for you here. second okay Okay. I see the new user is added. Okay. And then... So, the Summit Employment account, there is... Let's see. Training would need to be purchased by your account admin. And so I'm just double checking all the tickets related to Summit Employment to see if there was ever training purchased for the new users. Let's see. There's one other spot here. Okay, there is, let's see, a training ticket that had purchased training for, is this Summit? Yes, Summit Appointment. They purchased two hours and used one of those hours. So there is one hour left. Besides that, your contract signer, C.J. Owens, would have to purchase more training. But we can, I'll contact Jason, who was the trainer on this ticket from our team. and have him reach out to CJ maybe, or do you want him just to reach out to you about that one hour? No, he can reach out to CJ. Yes, that would be good. Okay. Awesome. I will let him know, and then we'll just kind of loop you in if there's more training purchased or if we just want to use that one remaining hour to help train you. Okay. Yeah, so why don't I just reach out to CJ and maybe just CC you so you kind of know what's going on with the training hours. Okay, perfect. All right, we'll get back to you soon then, and definitely reach out if you have any other questions. Okay, thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thanks. Bye....
