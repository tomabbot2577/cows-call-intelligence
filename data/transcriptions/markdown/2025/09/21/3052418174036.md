## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi. Hi, Mariana. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. Hi, Jim. How are you? I am very well. How are you? I'm good, too. Thank you. Excellent. Excellent. So glad we could get connected here. I'm still on the screen share, so I can share that as needed. Okay. But I wanted to just talk with you a few minutes about what you were looking for in a software package, what you're using now, and kind of what the main things are you really needed to do. uh yeah sure so uh we're a true um here we're now using um what's i don't know what is it called um is it called zoho yes oh soho yeah and um frankly uh i i guess i guess i own this company um and we're in a in a place where we're going to start scaling our business and i want to make sure that we have a good ATS in place before I do that. I've done it before, and I did it without an ATS, and it was a big mistake. That was years ago, and I'm not going to make that same mistake. Yeah, I did no investigating into Zoho before we kind of purchased it. It was through an assistant, and basically what we found is that it's just Excel, which is we already use Excel. It was very cheap, but it was also sort of just a waste of money. We want something a little more comprehensive, something where I can pull analytics, see what recruiters are doing and how they're doing it, and sort of point out. It'll kind of help me manage probably called a small team of like five people, seven people. help me manage them with like real numbers. And then the other piece of it, and I don't, I don't know if PC recruiter offers this, but is there any sort of AI candidate based sort of system that we could potentially use for marketing and business development? Oh yeah. Yeah, we do actually have this. So we would, we have kind of a sequencing piece that you can utilize for business developments. You can kind of build sequences. so as you build the database you can have automated sequences going out to people in your database based on what they do do they click the email do they reply did they not acknowledge it whatever it'll kind of move them through a process to the next step we have a sales pipeline so if you're looking to track people or attract organizations through a sales pipeline to close that deal and get that relationship to get jobs to fill we have that and then we also have a candidate pipeline as well for tracking candidates being interviewed for a job. So are we inputting all of the people or do you guys have a database like LOXO? We don't have a database. So we are just an empty database. You would need to provide the data from wherever you got it from. If you happen to have a spreadsheet of data, that can be imported in. We can pull it. You can pull people in from LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, kind of one-off to pull them in. You can parse resumes. You can mass parse resumes. If you happen to have a large folder of resumes you can mass parse those all in too and you can even hook this to your website so that you could have a place where candidates can apply to jobs or even just submit their information in general to your to your database right from there I see okay okay and then we also interface with like zoom info so if you wanted if you had zoom info account you could search and mass upload people from zoom info as well so a few different ways you could do that yeah okay let me show you around a little bit I'm gonna hop into our latest version of PC Recruiter here. Let me share my screen. Jump in if you have questions too and I think when we spoke the other day you were you have a half hour slot today so I'm going to try and keep it to a half hour. Get as much as we can in that half hour. Okay do you see my screen all right? Yep. Perfect perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and get myself signed in. So this is kind of our landing page. This is all cloud-based. It's going to be something you can run on a PC or a Mac. Everything's in the cloud. We have a mobile app so a lot of different ways that you can access the system here you're basically going to work within this dashboard you can set this dashboard off this is going to kind of be basically what's going on you have the ability to configure this and put some different stats in there so you can kind of look at various candidates working with recently modified records you can look at new pending or open jobs you can look at new names entered so this will give you some kind of very light information about what's going on in your database in addition this full analytics reporting to this is just your landing page when you log in down the left hand side of the screen you're going to notice a menu and this is going to get get you to the different various portions of the database so of course we're going to have three primary record types and those are going to be names companies positions so those are going to be the three records that we work with so names are going to be your candidates your contacts any person who has a record in the system compani...
