## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Well, damn, Tyler, that was fast response time then. How are you doing? Good. How are you today? I'm doing pretty good. I got a few questions for you. Hopefully you can help me out with it. Yeah, what's going on? So I work for Compatible Precise, FreeSource. I'm calling on behalf of GNS, who uses your applicant tracking system. and I'm just kind of trying to help her streamline a little things here and there. Can you help me out reorganizing a few things and changing a few things in the pipelines and in how we track candidates and everything? Yeah, I can show you how to do it. We can't make any changes on our end. Okay. What kind of things were you specifically looking to do? All right. So I didn't want to start blabbing at you and everything. So the first thing that I wanted to help clean up with her is our pipeline milestones. I don't know if you call them something different, but that's why I call them milestones. So for a role, it says inbox. Hold on. Let me get rid of this. inbox, review, contacted, sent to hiring manager, reviewed by hiring manager, feedback, phone interview, first person interview, second person, offer pending, and placements. Yeah, so what it looks like is that she's using the preloaded template that comes inside of PC Recruiter. If you go to System, and then you scroll in that list, you go to Database Setup, and then Pipeline Setup. Sorry, I'm trying to keep track of my steps so I can get back here. Database setup. You said go to pipeline setup? Yep. And those will be what we call the pipeline steps or like those milestone steps. Okay, got it. And while you can't edit the preloaded template that's in the database, As you can see, there's that new pipeline template. Yeah. It looks like she at some point. Pipeline and then new pipeline template. Yeah, it looks like she may have started to try and create a new template. Okay, yeah. But in there, if you create a new template or edit that new pipeline template, you could rename it to whatever you would need. You can make it the primary template. So going forward, that would be the template that the positions use when you create a position. And that's where you can go in and create your different steps. Got it. So a question I had and what she said, you know, because she is, I love her. She is a goldfish sometimes and she has like 1,200 billion things on her plate. So it goes really crazy. She's really worried about everything retroactively getting messed up. so if I make a new template is that going to mess up all the retroactive pipelines that we have for No. So because she was using that PCR pipeline and that one can't be edited all the positions that have already used it will stay those steps. It's just new positions going forward. So a question that I have to kind of more elaborate on that So, I don't want to, so, Condescent is who we're working, we'll say we're working with right now. So, we have this pipeline. We're using the template for you guys, the PCR pipeline template. If I create a new one, then when I, I would create a new pipeline for a role and just use the new template, correct? Yeah, you would create a new position record. Got it. So then I basically would need to make sure it's all copied correctly one by one and continue using the new template. Yeah, you could just copy people over from the other position and then just move them into the appropriate steps. Got it. And I can actually send you. We have a webinar on the pipeline that kind of goes through all of this. Oh, sweet. That would be awesome. I know she's only paying for one user. I'm not using it. I kind of more deal with the office running this, and she kind of asked me to kind of look into this and help her out. Yeah, not a problem. I don't want you thinking we're trying to take care of the system over here. No, you're fine. And what's a good email address for you? It is zmitchell, with two L's. So M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L? Yep. At preciseresource.com. All right. I just had a link to that webinar on over to you. Okay. Yeah, so that's where you would go in, create that new template, and then positions going forward, you can use it. Any existing positions that you want to use it, like you said, you would just need to create new position records, copy the names over to it, and then just make sure you track their steps appropriately. Okay. Awesome. And when you go and move someone through the pipeline, you'll see in those where it says drag and drop action, there's the pop-up and the move to. Yeah. If you switch those to pop-ups, you'll have the ability to retroactively set interview dates. Okay. or if you care more just about them being in the right spot you can always just move them from inbox to their current spot in the new pipeline and then just track the things going forward because their old steps will still be on their name record yes from the old position got it One question I hav...
