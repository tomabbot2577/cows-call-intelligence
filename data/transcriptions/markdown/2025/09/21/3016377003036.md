## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me, Seq with Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. Jeff Richmond. How are you today? Good. How are you? I am good. I got what I'm sure everybody calls a quick question. But I'm trying to rate and put feedback in for my candidates, and I don't seem to be able to do that as well as I used to in the new PCRM. So I must be missing something. So I was just wondering if you might be able to point me in the right direction for ranking my candidates. Okay, I see. So in PCRM, are you... Let's see. I'm going to log in to mine real quick here. What screen are you on where you're trying to enter in? I'm trying to go to... So I go to a position, and then I go to a pipeline. And then I open that up. And then I've got a bunch of candidates in a bunch of different boxes. So like the ones that have completed their applications, I've got app done. I just want to rate them. Okay. So the old PCR 9, I could just click the button and there was kind of a star box, but that seems to be missing now. So I go to feedback and even if I add feedback and there's a star box under add feedback, which is fine, I put that in, And it picks it up, I guess, if you look under feedback, because there's a new feedback tab on the top. But it won't do it under each person, if that's the way to – do you want to log in? It's probably the easiest. I can't. I'm on my screen right now. I'm taking a look. So the place where feedback is stored on a record is one of those tabs that's called feedback at the top. And if you hit the plus sign, you can add new feedback. And that's kind of where it's stored. Are you trying to store the feedback rating somewhere else? No, so that's fine. That's in. But when I'm just looking at all the candidates in a pipeline, so you have those boxes of everybody's name? Yeah. Under there, right, there's A to Z. There's a rating button. like if you go to the top of any like here yeah maybe we should let's do this yeah let's share screens I'm going to fire up I have ring central if you want to just give me a number oh perfect let's see okay the number is 360 I forget I forget how I get to that. Where do I, how do I? Oh, no worries. I think there's going to be like a video button in the main menu on the left of RingCentral. Yeah, hold on a sec. How do I get rid of my window? Oh. I can only just pull up, it's just got your name in my, like, because I'm on this call. Oh. How do I get back to that? If you, do you have the RingCentral icon in your taskbar at the bottom of Windows? Yeah. And you click that and... Does it open up the actual program? There we go. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, that was easy. Okay, perfect. What are we under? Sorry, video, right? Got it. Video and then join. It shouldn't have been as hard as it was. Video, join. Don't worry. Okay, go ahead. The number is 360-146-793. Awesome. And if you just want to continue without audio, since we're already at home, and then share. Yeah, there we go. Okay, I can see your RingCentral screen. Okay, so see these guys, like, I don't know, these four people? Oh, okay. And it says rating. Right. I'm trying to, like, I want to put the top one there. at the top and then the bottom was at the bottom and so for Edgar as an example like I've already gone in I've already put one like a one star feedback for him and saved it so that's in and even if I refresh this it just doesn't do anything okay let me recreate that online real quick here that being said I go to the feedback icon up here and all that doesn't seem to work right now either. Oh, okay. So I'm adding feedback to this guy. I'm going to refresh the page. Let me still have rating zero. Okay, let me see if there's a different spot here where... Yeah, I'm able to recreate the issue in PCR-9 as well as in PCRM. The feedback area on the – within the pipeline, you add that feedback, it is not affecting the rating score at all in that view. 9 or 10 or 9 or pcrm so um yeah you see there is some other feature in pcr9 related to rating let me check that real quick here um we can look at this way So see, it is a bit of a different screen here on 9. so if I go to I don't know I did Madden or whatever at the top and if I click that it'll go in I believe see the pipeline progress I hit there yeah so that's available in nine but not in PCRM and let's just refresh and see yeah so then you're rating now that one yeah okay yeah so I was going to the PCR9 there's a feedback tab as well across the top and that pulls in all the feed. Okay, so it's that specific one at the top right. Got it. Okay, I will open up a ticket and get back to you. It seems like it's a, like a bug that they haven't programmed the rating part to work in PCR 9 just yet. Okay, so let me get back to you via email. Let's see what I have. I have jrichmond at nafor.com. Yep. Okay. Awesome. I will get back to you as soon as I hear from the development team. All right. Thanks, Garrett. Thanks. Bye. Okay....
