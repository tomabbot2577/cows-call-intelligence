## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. It's Heather calling from Harbinger Network. How are you doing? Good. How are you, Heather? Good, thank you. Just wondering, if I accidentally merged a couple companies together, can I backtrack that at all? so unfortunately you can't but in that new merged company you'll see an attachment yeah that'll have it'll like tell you what was merged so you can actually like find like the old company names but the only way to undo a merge would be for us to do a backup yeah I think I can manually backtrack it. It's not like too many names that I like merged all together to one company. So I'll backtrack it. I just thought if there's a quick way to undo it, that would be helpful. Unfortunately, not with the merging. Like I said, the quickest way is going to be using that attachment just to see exactly which companies were merged, including the new ones. Yep, no problem. Okay, thanks so much for your help, Tyler. Yep, no problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye....
