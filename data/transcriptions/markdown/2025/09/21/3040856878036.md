## 💬 Full Transcript

 Loyal Murphy speaking. Hey, it's Robin. How are you? Hey, Robin. How are you? I'm good. It's been so long. You probably did not see my email, so you're probably like, Robin who? Robin at Main Sequence. No, Robin Montoni, right? Yeah. Okay. I remember you. It's been a long time. How are you doing? I'm good. We have a major billing situation. and I was trying to email Loyal A and then Loyal.R at Loyal Safety Search for like a while and it's just been bouncing. We actually had two issues go on. One at some point, you might have given us a new card, whatever, and it was like a sales receipt, which means we just send you a receipt, but the card was never processed. Okay. And then we also switched billing systems because that old system was just too archaic. So there are current, we really have not received a payment since let's see when's the last payment received all your invoices from april 2024 have not been paid 2024 yeah yeah yeah so some of it was yeah some of it was here i'm is this i'm going to send you one email i try to send you guys one of them yeah that's the loyal safety search email like shut down so Like I was getting so much spam and all this stuff. So I shut that whole email down and then I was using a new email. So that's probably part of what happened there. So here's one issue. And then there was like another where then just as we switched to the new system, they just weren't processing. So I'm going to send you this one that I sent you. So what happened before was that maybe a card, there was literally like a checkbox. We had it set up in our old system because of sales receipt. They didn't really, I guess at one point, support auto pay. So basically what it does is it sends you a receipt saying it's paid, and it looked like to me you, but it never processed a card because one box was not checked. So for these, I was sending this email. Should I send it to this Outlook one? Yeah, that's the best email right now. Okay, let me send this to you so you can see what this is. But then there's actually a couple more invoices. Okay. I mean, I can pay whatever, like, outstanding bill is there. It's really not that big of a deal. So this is just the one email that I was trying to send to you previously, like, in July about this mix-up with this one checkbox not being selected that never processed. So right now, technically, let me make sure there's no late fees being applied. Okay. Yes, there is one here. Let me turn that off. Yeah, that's what got a late fee. I don't know if you want to check your statements. I mean, we kind of really had to comb through a lot of accounts. I think I was being billed. I'm pretty sure I was being billed through last year because I feel like I remember looking it up for my taxes this year. you might have been getting but it wasn't actually the card wasn't processed oh yeah and which was yeah there was just a couple customers where somebody must have maybe like you gave a new card and a box literally was not checked it says automatically process this it was just basically as if you I tried to explain it to somebody here they're like well how does it happen it's like well these sales receipts it's like walking up to a counter at Starbucks saying, and then they hand you a receipt before you even try to process a card. Like it was sending you a receipt, but never processing the card. Yeah. So we switch nobody's on sales receipts anymore with our new system. It was not, it was a way to kind of do auto pay. Not ideal. So right now the total balance between those that I just emailed you about plus April, May. Wait, that is okay. So those are the ones where that happened, where they were sales receipts. And then starting in April, you were getting truly invoices. so what I first have to do though is what email do you want us to use for your billing going forward um you can use the loyal.a at outlook.com okay loyal.a at outlook.com okay I'm going to save that do you want like a backup one as well like just something to like have in case you're ever having the situation again. Yeah, I mean, I was, like, going in, and I was like, well, I actually checked your database, and I think even your username still had that email address. I'm like, I wonder if they just, like, you know, not in business anymore. So that's why we ended up just shutting it down. Well, there were some changes, yeah. So, like, my dad retired. I moved. You know, like, there were some definite changes. We switched down to, I believe, one user only, which was mine. so yeah there were there were some changes and i probably just didn't uh you know button that up upon the move and like the new company name and all that stuff so okay well i don't want to sticker shock you but it is a sticker shock the current balance is 1693.80 now what I can do though is that 16 months of billing isn't it $100 yep there's 16 months April 2024 to your last one January July 27th April 27th 24th Yeah. Okay. Now, some of them... I'm surp...
