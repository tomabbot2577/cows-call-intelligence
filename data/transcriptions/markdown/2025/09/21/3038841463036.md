## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. My name is Bruce Bradford-Royal, and I'm a customer, and trying to figure out why when I'm in a roll-up and I go to change the stage, I'm getting a very small fraction of the screen to come up. Oh, yep. So we see that when we push out a small update to PCR, to the software, some computers require a clearing of the cache on your browser to have the display issues. I'll walk you through a specific way to do that. So at the top right of your browser, click the three dots. Okay. And then go to more tools, more tools towards the bottom. What? It's called more tools. Yeah, towards the bottom there. Got it. Got it. And then what's the other one? Developer tools. I'm writing this down so I don't have to call you every time. Okay, yeah. Developer tools. Got it. So that'll open up some coding and stuff. You could just leave that off to the side, ignore it, and then up by your web address, www. To the left of that, you want to right-click on the refresh button. And that's going to be that arrow in a loop icon. If you right-click on it. Click what? It's the refresh button. You want to right-click on it. It's to the left web address. Oh, yeah, yeah. Right-click on that, and then you'll have the option to click Empty Cache and Hard Reload. Right-click, Empty Cache and Hard Reload. and that'll fix it it'll slowly refresh the page um at that point you could close those developer tools and that should um get everything i can close the developer tools right now or not well after you hit empty cache and hard reload then you can close them yep okay got it all right so let me try this again then yep that worked awesome awesome man thank you no problem reach out if you need anything else all right have a good one you too...
