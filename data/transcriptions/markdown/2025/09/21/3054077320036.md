## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon, this is Chuck Windisch. Hi, Chuck. This is Robin. Hi. I got an email from somebody. That was me just a moment ago. That was you? Okay. Yeah. I was going to send it and then I'll follow up with you too. Well, what I'm doing is I did everything you said. I did get the test completed, so I think that might have fixed it. But now I'm sending an email out to myself just to make sure. Can you bear with me a minute? Yeah. It looks like, did you change your email password? Not that I'm aware of, no. That's why it was kind of weird. I mean, you know, oh, it went through. So it looks like everything's fine now. Okay. Now there's one other area. Maybe just Office 365 needed you to reauthenticate because your incoming is fine. Are you still under system email setup? Let me see. No, I mean, I can. I can get there. Okay. Yeah, if you can go back there. Okay, so I'm under system email setup. Okay, the email alias list is your settings for sending an email when you are logged in as admin. You know, it's all just based on the user. Because you're an administrator, you also see right below email alias list, you see outgoing mail settings. Yes. That is more of a database account. Sometimes you might have, like, if you're using presentations where it sounds like, hey, this presentation has been viewed. It's something that's triggered by the database. You also have that using your email address. So you'll want to go into outgoing mail settings and really just do the same thing, the black sign in with Microsoft option. Okay. And what's this do for me? So let's say if your database, like if you had the PCR job board, if you have your job board configured that when somebody applies to my position, it sends me an email, this is the email that those kind of notifications are coming from. Okay. Because it's not like the user doing the action, it's the database doing it. You just happen to be using. All right, so that one. Go ahead, I'm sorry. I was going to say, you just happen to be using your email address for both, your username and for database triggered actions. Yes. Okay, so that test was successful as well, so I guess I'm all set to go. I think you're good. If you're running anything else, let me know. Thanks for the immediate help. I was getting ready to send a bunch out, and I started having a problem, so I appreciate it. And again, with Office 365, don't send too many at once. You don't want to get your account marked as spam or anything like that. Right, right. I'm sending them out to people that know me anyway. So how many are you suggesting I send out at a time? I would try to do 50 to 100 at a time. Long gone are those days of taking your entire database and just blasting it. Office 365 will not let you do that. It's also even just risky. Oh, you actually have some. You know what you also have? You have an image that has an excessive amount of source code. I wonder if that maybe can do something to you too. Hold on one second. Do you have this image? It's GA with a green background. Okay. I'm going to try to clean up that image for you. If you just kind of paste an image, it kind of generates a long code. But there's a place called Server Image Store. We can upload there. It generates a link, which shortens up the code. So let me do that for you. Okay. Save this image. Save image as pictures. Okay. So let me go upload it to the server image store. That will definitely help with delivery. Okay. So that's for when I insert the signature into my email on PC Recruiter, correct? Yeah, basically what would happen here before I change it, are you still in that email setup area? Yes, I believe I am, yes. Okay. Over at the right, click email signature. Okay. in the editing toolbar there's a source code icon it's the less than greater than symbol it's right before the set of binoculars um let's oh yeah okay okay yes look at all that big long string that's just your image oh geez yeah so what so in peace recruiter there's it's called a server image store You upload the image you want to use there, and it makes a nice, clean link. So what I'm going to do now is click on Insert Image. I'm just going to replace the source code, like that big, long link, with this nice, clean one. So let me do that for you. Save. Okay. Go out of the email signature. Don't save it because I just saved it. But go out and then reopen it, and then go back to the source code. Okay. So see how it's a little bit shorter now? A lot shorter now. So what I did is I clicked on the image, and then there's that insert image icon. I just replaced the source of it. Okay. That we can generate. Just cleans it up. Otherwise, especially if I'm like Office 365, you start seeing like this big, long string. That could also cause some issues too. So this will help. Well, in Outlook, I also have a signature if I use Outlook directly without PC Recruiter. Is that going to be the same problem then? No, but sometimes when you're just – it's basically trying to ...
