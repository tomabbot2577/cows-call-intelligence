## 💬 Full Transcript

 Taylor Transportation Search Group, this is Lisa. Hi, Lisa. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm good. I wanted to give a call, talk with you, or email with you, I think, gave you a quote for the AI package of PC Recruiter and what it will cost to add that. Just call him back to follow up and see if you were thinking about that, if you had any questions or any interest in exploring that further. Not at this time, but I do know that eventually we will. Do they have a cost for that? Yeah, I think I'd send it over to you. I think it would be $500 to set it up. And then because for you, you need to upgrade to the Premium Plus. You're on the Enterprise, it looks like. So it would be $500 to set it up, and then it would take you up like $20. So it would take you from $95 to $105 per user per month. If you want, I can email that over so you have it. That would be great. Okay. I'll email that over and then I'll follow up maybe a couple months just to check in. That would be great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Not a problem. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
