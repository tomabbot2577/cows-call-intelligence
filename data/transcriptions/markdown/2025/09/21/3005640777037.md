## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey Robin. Hey. So, did you, so do you know about the tax thing? I was trying to figure out these bills. I'm so freaking annoyed with Integrity today. Yeah. Really freaking annoyed. What did they do? Because they keep, I think she has somebody going in and applying these tax rates or whatever. and then I think they're going into like an open invoice whatever adjusting and saying oh yeah update recurring so it's screwing up like if we already did the user adjustment I'm really freaking annoyed with them right now yeah I think we need to have a meeting with Kathy because I'm like this needs to I just wrote earlier like this needs to stop like whoever's going in and doing this they've screwed everything up like probatest we already dropped them down to three they got billed for five again um because i think they went into an invoice and then updated like stop messing with the recurring go and apply the tax but don't change the users and then somebody else with that was on hold they went into the recurring and then whenever they saved it or whatever it enabled that so they're going to have that i literally done nothing else other than fix their damn mistakes this morning. And I'm still going through the emails. Like, I'm furious right now. Furious. And none of that makes sense, why they're adjusting that stuff. That's why we just need to have a meeting with her. I need to talk to her about like, why that's happening and what we should be doing. Well, I mean, I think I figured it out. I'm like, because apparently there might be like a lot audit trail. I think she has somebody else going in and, you know, because there are certain locations where you're supposed to be applying tax, like Chicago and then Ohio by county. And I think Patsy was not doing anything for Chicago. But there's, like, I Googled it. It's basically if you connect through a cloud thing, it's considered, I forget what the rule is, how to explain it. But basically if you're accessing something by a cloud, Chicago wants their tax paid. and but in Ohio it's not just Lake County tax it's where the person is so they had to go do that and then the other ones are just selecting out of state so when they're going in and changing all of these they're screwing things up so I pointed out is it possible if they went into an existing invoice that was open and fixed it that they're selecting because there's like no edit this one time or there's hitting like edit recurring that's an option i never do that i always do it separately you know what i mean i do just this invoice only and then i go in and if there's a change on the recurring i do that separate so i think they're hitting that edit recurring so if they were for example at five and we already have the recurring set to three because they dropped like you know between cycles well it's updating that recurring to five so now the only thing I can really do is let people know like let me know because I have no idea how to really go back and change all these I don't know what else was changed you know what I mean so right now I'm just being responsive it's just too many cooks in the kitchen I don't want everybody in here because I'm really wanting to point fingers at people and the less fingers I because I first thought I was going crazy I told Davisha I'm like I thought I was going crazy like I see notes that I did it and like I'm not stupid I know how to change the recurring you know then we finally figured out this and then now so like too many cooks in the kitchen I don't want five people in this billing system making changes yeah yeah because when I get an email like you know I'm wanting to I'm getting to the point and wanting to point fingers and at least now I can kind of point them all to integrity because I like literally have a document I did this I did this and and then it's changed again like another one like they went in and somehow change it to do a pound receipt when the person asked for 30 days I already had it changed I already have it noted and even in the quick like it's just really annoying so yes I'm a little crabby. So what they've been doing now is that they're giving a discount for sales tax if you're not in the locations that it should be charged. And because they didn't want everyone's pricing to go up, is that what it was? I don't really know. I think it was maybe more like a cleanup that because they didn't collect it, but they need to collect it going forward. but then why would it like right now it says what's what's the invoice what are we referring to which one 220-2528 let me look at that one i think it's just because they did not collect it before but they were supposed to okay but they need to be but they need to be it's Chicago I'll find it How did I find it before? Hold on one second. Basically if you're using an online service, if you're in Chicago. Does Chicago explain charging a customer in Chicago tax for online service? They have a name for it. Hold on. I probably l...
