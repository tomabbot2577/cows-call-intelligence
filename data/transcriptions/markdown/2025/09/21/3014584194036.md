## 💬 Full Transcript

 relationship with Lenar for over 20 years. Hello? Five years ago, they actually penned a paper and made their relationship. Thank you for holding this. This is Robin. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. Hi, Robin. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Thank you. I'm just calling in from the Newport group, and I have a question. so one of our recruiters Brian he his email got disconnected from PCR and then we just connected it but I just want to make sure that I did it correctly and if it will repopulate emails that he sent out and received from when it was disconnected was it like the alias was not connected I think so so when we I just checked it today and at first it said when you put in test connection it was unsuccessful and then we just sign in with Microsoft and tested again and it's it says successful now but yeah there's any additional steps well you might have if it was sending an email those would not have gone through because the mail server would have rejected it now for incoming that's actually authenticated in another place. Okay. So let me see. Pull that one back in here. And I'm sorry, what was your name again? Giselle, G-E-S-S-E-L. So it was with Newport? Yes, the Newport group. So that's kind of how our relationship developed. We started recruiting for them out here, on positions out here. And then because we did a good job, we placed a few people. In fact, the vice president of acquisition, who is one of the decision makers on this position, is a gentleman named – Can you spell your name again for me again? J-E. Oh, I wouldn't have an account with PCR. I use the admin one, but I can give you the username of the recruiter. What is your name? Because I'm trying to even just pull up your information here. Oh, okay, yeah. It's J-E-S-S-E-L. Last name is Paredes. Gotcha. P-A-R-E-D-E-S. I didn't know I was spelling it. I don't know what I did. Okay. What is the database that the user logs into? The Newport Group, one word. The Newport Group, one word. Okay. And what is the username? B-H-A-R-M-E-N. H-A-R-M-O-N. I'm sorry, what was that again? H-A-R-M-O-N. Yes, that's correct. That's kind of how we got to working on this. As I mentioned, this is with Lennar. They developed the land. The land is used for remote master plan communities. It's not set up for incoming. So it would only be sending. Oh, okay. How do we set up the incoming? Hold on a second. Let's see. So sending from PCR, if that's where you had the email alias issue, that is corrected because he did do the sign-in with Microsoft. Okay. Is he trying to do like a mail campaign or something? I'm not sure what that is but he has the the PCR for Outlook add-on thing and yeah. Now that one what did what did you see there? What was it saying like that that the password into the app wasn't working or because that could be something different or did you only email alias list. I only did the email alias list. Okay so that's what the problem with that means is if you if he was sending an email from or she and he was to the person yes right okay if they were trying to email directly from PC recruiter nothing would have sent because they couldn't connect to the mail server. Okay. Which wouldn't really have anything to do with your Outlook portal add-in because that's really just kind of doing the activity syncs and stuff like that yeah so anything that he tried or she tried to send from pcr directly would not have sent because of that error before gotcha i think he's just been sending uh emails through his regular outlook Yeah, that's how he usually does it. Let me see if the person has any activities, just to make sure. Okay. Okay, so if I go activities, I'll go to the beginning of July. So anything written by the portal either writes as email or email received. Okay. So when. Or received. Okay. So users B, Harmon. Let me see when they got their last activity. Seven, nine. Yeah. That's as far as it recorded. Okay. Are you at that computer right now? Yes. Okay. Can we. Do you have RingCentral by any chance? Yes, I do. Okay. So if you're at that computer, open up the Ring Central app. Okay. And then go to video and then select join. Okay. Sorry, I'm seeing the computer is a bit slow. Okay. A join. Yep. Okay. I'm going to ask you for a meeting ID. Yes. Ready. It's 050. 394-810. And you don't need to join with audio or camera because we're already on the phone and we're going to be watching the screen, not the camera. Perfect. Okay. Okay. So it looks like you're in or getting in. Okay. I'm on. Okay. At the bottom of the screen, select share. I'm asking for kind of a range. But make sure you go over to entire screen. Other things. Income, maybe, you know, what's the bonus, you know, information like, and then the healthcare and. Loading. Parts to a base salary. I'm only interested in base salary ranges right now to get a feel for where you need to be. Can you give me an idea as far as a salary range, what you'd be looking for? All right. I'm ...
