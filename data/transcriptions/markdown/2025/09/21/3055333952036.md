## 💬 Full Transcript

 I missed your call. Please leave me your number, even if you think I already have it. And please tell me what time zone you're in and how early and how late I can call. Thanks so much. Take care. Bye. Please leave a message at the tone. When finished, you may hang up or press pound for additional options. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I just received your email, your response to our ticket that we have open, that you're having trouble logging into PCR. And you said you couldn't really get a hold of somebody on the phone here. So I just wanted to give you a quick call. Sorry we missed you. I'll just respond via the ticket, via email, and we'll try to get this sorted out for you. Thanks....
