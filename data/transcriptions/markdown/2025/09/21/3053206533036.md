## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Oh, hey, Tyler. This is Jason Gibson with Sunset Transportation. How are you, my friend? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. I'm doing well. Thank you for asking. I just had a quick question regarding profiles. Mm-hmm. So the way that I utilize PCR, I use it for in-house. well i'm not just for in-house i use it for external but i um my background is third party i used pcr in a couple of firms i worked with so when i started in-house um i requested pcr as my app contracting system so that i could um not just handle internal applications and and that sort of thing would also recruit um i'm working with another company or not another company our parent company has asked me to conduct a search. I'm conducting that search and I had created a profile for each of the candidates to complete where they list their salary range. We are at the stage in the interview process where the senior VP of HR does not want to share the salary with the folks that will be conducting the interview. So I was curious, is there a way to hide the salary information on a presentation of the candidate's information that includes their profile? So if you ask that in the profile and you're sharing the profile, no. Yeah. Okay. Because that information is already in there. Yes. Is there a... Let me see here. If I go to the profile and I change the – can I temporarily, upon sharing, change – can I hide that question, I wonder? Let me see. If I go to – So even if you change in the profile setup, like if you take those questions out, you would then have to re-save the profile like save the new profile to the record without the salary information hmm okay so I would just have to maybe I just delete maybe I just delete that information altogether on the profile you could but like I said when you save a profile to a name record it's saved in the attachments as it was when it was completed so even if you delete it from like the profile setup you would then have to go into the candidates submit a new submit that profile again without the salary information hmm i see what you're saying Interesting. I'm wondering if... Yeah, that definitely makes a difference if I... Because I want to ask that information of the candidate, but they don't want them to see that information in the interview. Okay, I think I will probably just need to create a separate profile without the salary information. yeah that would probably be the best bet and manually put that information yeah especially like you said it's sucks that it has to be done manually like copying some stuff over but you would have to manually go in and redo every profile anyway to take out that salary information if it was on the original one. I got you. I got you. Okay. And then what about the other question I had? When I'm sending emails, I'm noticing that I'm getting double signatures. Like when I look at the email in my Outlook, there are double signatures. Do you know why that's happening? what email are you sending out are you sending a form letter out of PC Recruiter yeah so what form letter are you sending I don't know it happens on Let me see here. Let me find an example of one. Okay. Hi, Taylor. Thank you for... Thank you for considering sunset. And that would be in a pipeline email. Is it the thank you for your interest in sunset transportation? Yes. Is that one that automatically goes out for like the rejection letter? Yeah. Yeah. You only have some current user email signature in there once. It says, well, does it read, Hi, Tiffany, thank you for considering an opportunity with Sunset Transportation. we appreciate the time you took to apply for the operation support position while we were impressed with your qualifications. No, not that one. Okay. Let me see. So I sent this out yesterday, Tiffany's farm. Let me go and find out which Tiffany I can probably pull up by most recent activity. This is Tiffany Sam. She applied to Operation Support Nashville. What's the first and last name of the candidate? Tiffany is the first name and the last name is Sam. P-H-A-M. a m which database is that person in the bgc no some transportation so i'm not seeing that name record in here You said the last name was Than, P-H-A-N? P as in Paul, H-A-N as in Mary. There we go. If I go to the pipeline setup. Yeah, so that's the letter that's selected for not a fit. MSHOS, okay, out of process. Is that the correct letter? That's what I'm looking at right now. All right, so it's called Rejection Not a Fit. If that's the one, yeah. Yeah, so that form letter looks correct. are you able to forward me the email so I can take a look at it what's your email address it's ttroutman t-r-a-u-t-m-a-n at main sequence dot net ttroutman at main sequence dot net yep okay just one t correct T-T-R-O-T-M-A-N. T-T-R-A-U-T-M-A-N. Oh, I'm sorry. T-T-R-A-U-T-M-A-N. Why is it not letting me change the email? Okay, there we go. Perfect. So, T-R-A-U-T-M-A-N....
