## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Mean Sequence Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Hi, Jason. This is Mark Morick with Cerise Morick. I had a question about an issue I'm having with kind of my update on Outlook. Okay. Yeah, what's going on? So I have a resume I received from a candidate from their email. It's the right email that's in PCR. And when I go to do the drop-down, you know, update resume at that email address, it's telling me that name record does not exist in PCR for, quote, TerryGilliam at gmail.com. And it's TerryGilliam at gmail.com is sitting in the – on the candidate's record. Which database is this in? General. Okay. What was that name again, Terry? What? T-A-R-I is the first name. Okay. And then the last name is Gilliam, G-I-L-L-I-A-M. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Why don't we hop on a screen share and we can take a look at this? because, yeah, I do see the email address listed in here. Is that maybe a custom field? Hold on. No. Okay. Yeah, let's hop on a screenshot together and take a look at it. Do you use RingCentral? Yes. Okay. Go ahead and open RingCentral, and I'll give you an ID whenever you're ready. Video. Yeah, video. Join. Yep, just fine. Okay. Go ahead. Send it. The ID is 042-555. Yep. 041. All right. Continue without audio. All right. Then go ahead and share your screen. There's that blue share button at the bottom. Just make sure you select an option under entire screen. All right. We're going to go screen two. What do you want to see? Because I have two screens, Jason, so I got to flip it over. Yeah. Pull over Outlook in the email that you received. Do you see it? Yep. Okay. And can you try doing that update thing again just so I can see what pops up? Name record just now exists. Okay. Close this out. If I come over here, that's the name record. Yeah, yeah. Can you close this really quick, minimize that, and go to the PC Recruiter tab at the top? Okay. Yep. And then go to Options in the, it's like the fifth column. No, there's a copy too. There's the email and then there's like a copy. I'm sorry, Jason. Hang on. No, you're good. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry, Jason, did you need that open or did I screw something up? No, no, you're okay. I was just, I was doing some digging inside the database and just making sure certain things lined up. Can you click on that drop, do you see where it says logged out at the top? Can you go to that dropdown? To the seventh column or so? Yeah, drop that down. Go back to options. Hit test connection at the top. Okay, now you're seeing fine. Hit save and close again. And then can you try that one more time? What, the log this? The trying to bring the resume in. Because that save and close seem to have logged you in. And I wonder if it wasn't connected. I'm sorry. It's logged out. Yeah. That's it. There we go. Now I know. Jason, thank you. I appreciate it. Yep. Absolutely. Have a good day. Have a good one. Yeah, you too. Thanks. Bye....
