So we'll do like a 70% increase. That's true. And just a one year, so you're not in a two year. Okay. And I could email you the paperwork to get started, review everything. Are you still at 555 Sun Valley Drive Suite H3? Yes, sir. Okay, fantastic. And Polikov Recruitment Services? It's Polikov Recruitment Solutions. Solutions, I read it wrong. And it's no longer CJ Walsh, anything like that? No. Okay. And obviously not Roswell North either because you're not MRI anymore. Correct. Cool. So what I'll do, let me go ahead and email that over to you. Take a look. There's not going to be any more. If you leave anything, it'll go up. It's on our standard now. That'll be all we're good at. And then once we get it re-signed, we can get everything adjusted. And we also have a premium version which adds like email campaigns, sequencing, analytics. If you ever want to explore it, just let me know. on that because there's a little bit more package than you have available. Okay. So if it's a year contract, then next year are we doing this again or does it just automatically renew unless we tell you we're not interested anymore? It will automatically renew unless you opt out of the renew. Yeah, we're leaving and just within 30 days of that, just let us know. Or if you upgrade any time, we'd write a new agreement for the upgrade and it would replace this one. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Very well. that over let me know what you get it if you have any questions or anything I'll keep an eye out to get it signed and back get adjusted okay perfect thank you so much I really appreciate it my pleasure thank you very much okay all right bye...
