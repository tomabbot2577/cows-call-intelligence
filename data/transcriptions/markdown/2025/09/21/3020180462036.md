## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. Good morning. How are you? I am well. How are you? How are both of you? I'm good. This is Mike, and she was with me as well. Okay. Hello. Hi, Jim. Hello. Yes, I wanted to show you around PCRM a little bit. Have you recently looked at the PCR10 at all? Have you been in there recently or no? got to be honest no i have i have a little bit like i was telling you but yeah um okay yeah what uh that kind of changed as as we were going through with the the pcr 10 product i was telling mike yesterday um when it was originally conceived a couple of years ago it was um it was going to be a replacement it was going to be a new interface that was going to replace the old 9 interface. But as we were developing it, we added some extra CRM functionality and combined with the fact that we were also talking with people that didn't dislike 9 and didn't want to leave it. So what they ended up doing is spinning it off as kind of a separate product called PCRM. And what it is, it's more of a PCRM product, but it basically contains all the functionality of PC Recruiter itself as well. And it's wrapped in a new interface. So that's kind of where it's ended. So what people are doing now is since we released it, maybe February, March was when it came out officially that we were releasing it, maybe April. And it is something that will run off the same database as PC Recruiter. It'll just give you a different access point. So you're accessing the same data real time. And if you had half the office using PCRM, half using PCR9, that's no problem. Everything is shared. So people are getting it like we've been selling it kind of included with the new package. So when you buy a PC Recruiter as a new customer, you get both PCR9 and PCRM. You can pick and choose which you want to use and maybe you'll gravitate toward one or the other. So we've kind of left it in the client's hands. So I want to show you around a little bit some of the stuff in PCRM, some of the new stuff added, and it might be some of a refresher of what you've seen. you've seen we've also improved the searching a little bit as well just a question though when it comes to like you said that you can access the data and both like existent existing there is a drop down menu of like how you log in to databases so is it the same kind of functionality that you would have different login points or how is that the same the same everything just with different login points so let me share my screen and I'll show you mine for example so I'm looking at my sign in for PCRM here and it has all of the same databases as I have in my exact same database right here so same exact everything same usernames the same passwords the same databases and if you change something in one it's instantly available in the other because they're sharing the same database okay so it's it's very convenient to almost give you the chance to use either or both and see what you like better and maybe down the line nobody knows but maybe people will start to gravitate more toward PCRM and in a number of years PCR 9 might be phased out but right now there are no plans to phase out PCR 9 because it's it's still the product there and just adds some different things and gives a new format there so I'm gonna go ahead you have myself logged in. Oh, go ahead. If there are different databases that actually you log into and it's real time, so it is real time, so if one recruiter is operating in PCR 9 but three are operating in PCR N, whatever is done in one or the other is automatically synced automatic? Yeah. Okay. Like real time. So even if I went in and I can log into both and if I logged into PCR 9 here and I went to just a random name record here and let's say we went to Paula and we added a quick activity and I can say talk to her today I can throw this in pick my activity there and then I can say if I look up Paula if I go over in PCR M I can go to names I can look her up but she's already going to be the most recent person there I can click right into her name look at her activities and that's going to show up right there okay so it's it's all true real-time okay perfect okay so what the biggest thing we did with the PCRM is everything's down the left-hand side of the screen so a lot of these are going to be the same button as a nine but down the left-hand side everything's going to load in from the right so for example if I go to names I clicked on Paula's name her name loads in from the right side of the screen we've added this workspace which gives you the ability to design an initial custom workspace here okay I can zoom in let me zoom out a little bit so you can actually have your own custom workspace there but then you're also going to have access to all the tabs you norm...
