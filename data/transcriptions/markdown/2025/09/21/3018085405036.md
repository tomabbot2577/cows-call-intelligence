## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Glenn Gardner. How are you doing? I'm doing good. Good, good. I had a quick question. I am trying to find kind of people that are very dead in my database, and I really don't know, like I said, with this new AI stuff and all this stuff. You know, if I'm looking in, if I go in the names record and put in, you know, a few keywords, I get, you know, a zillion people, but I'm just trying to figure out new ways to find people that haven't been touched, if that made sense. Okay. Yeah. So let's see if you have the AI search turned on for your database. I think I do because I just got an email for it. So we had upgraded our system, and then business really sucks for us. So I downgraded my system and then realized we couldn't send bulk email. We could, but it was very time-consuming. So we upgraded our system back, and I just got to think about this AI. So that's why I was calling. Oh, sure. Yeah, so we've released an AI free trial for three AI features, which is AI job summary, AI candidate summary, and AI email generator. The fourth one, though, AI search. And once again, I'm not interested. I think I've had those and tried it before, and that really wasn't my forte, so I'm more interested in search. Okay, gotcha. So the AI search isn't automatically turned on on your database. It'll have to be requested because certain databases don't have the Lucene search engine built into them. Mine did. I think I upgraded that in the past. I remember paying for something with this Lucene thing. Oh, okay. I'm pulling that up. But I don't know. Who knows what I have? Like I said, I've been with you for 25 years, so it's kind of hard to understand what I have and what I don't have. Okay, yeah, I'm looking right now and you do have Lucene. Excellent. So I can actually right now, I'm going to turn on your AI search in your database since you have all the right parts here. And so what you'll need to do is probably log out of PCR and log back in in order to see the AI search tool. Okay. Reload. Hold on a second. I'm smart enough to do that. Barely. Okay. Gotcha. All right. All right. I'm there. And then if you use the quick search up at the top right of PCR, you should see a toggle to turn on AI. Okay. Yep. And that'll give you a guide where it gives you, you know, a starting place on how do you formulate your questions and your sentences to the AI where it makes most sense. And it even gives you a couple examples as a starting place. But for the one you're asking about, you might want to start with something like show me name records with a last activity in 2024 or a last activity in 2020. If you want to go back further, maybe something along those lines. And it'll show you some people with those with that qualification. OK, so let's start. So I just hit this suggestion for interviews. reviews. So I just put it in this recent searches or search. Where do I type this? Go up to the top in that gray bar across the top in the search bar. That's where you can type in your sentence. Oh, okay. So you're typing in the search bar, not in the keyword. right yeah the AI was just turned on towards that inherently not obvious but that's okay that's why we're on the phone okay well I and then how can it just search names instead of companies or end position was that a legitimate question so I guess absolutely show me plus entities criteria so yes let's show me names maybe yeah so you could say show me names with last activity in 2020 or something like that and it'll most likely be able to pull that back for you okay yeah I'm doing that right now okay so 200 my name came up that shouldn't be these are all show me last show me names of last activity in 2020 that i totally didn't do anything because it you know it just showed me a lady that i just sent an email received today so all these things are very recent it did it just the opposite okay so try putting um last activity Before 2020, maybe? Before 2020. Okay. So just trying to get this right. Before. In 2020. E-F-R-E. Well, that just gave me – it popped up with the person I just emailed two seconds ago. So we're doing it exactly opposite of what you said. Okay. So are you still using that search bar up at the top right, or are you doing anything with the basic search on the left? Nope. Let's actually take a look together. I'm going to jump on a screen share with you and see what's going on there. I'm not trying to be an asshole or anything. I'm just saying it. Oh, no, no. This is all wild, wild west for all of us, right? Exactly. So in a new tab in your browser, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. ID, please. That is 778-843-629. Join a meeting? Meeting ID. Asking for the ID again. It brought me to the central. Oh, that makes sense. Okay. So that's 778-843-6262. nine okay I've allowed as a loud joint audio to go without audio okay so we're there so perfect just click the blue share butto...
