## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Maine Sequel Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. My name is Bob Sullivan. I'm a customer. And I'm just curious. I use a Mac to use PC Recruiter. I use the ASP. And for about the last four to five weeks, PC Recruiter keeps crashing. like the browser like goes and like wherever I'm at, I have to reopen the browser and log back in. And I thought it would, I just, I guess I assume it would just go away. I didn't know if there was a bug or a fix or I don't really know what's going on, but I've been a user for PC Recruiter for like 20 years. I've never really had this issue. Is there a known issue with using the ASP on browsers using Macs at all? So I guess I have some questions. When you say it crashes, do you mean like you just – like in the middle of you working, it will just stop working? Yep. it'll just go to a no page, almost like not even my homepage. It just goes like error. Like there's some type of a – I don't have an example right now, you know what I mean? But like I've gone in and deleted files. Like I don't know what to do. It's almost like it just stops working and I have to hit – I have to open it in a browser again and log back in. And it's like the page just goes to like a non-working page, like an error page. Okay. Is this in the middle of your workflow, like as you're working? Oh, it happens. At this point, it's happening about 10 to 12 times a day. Oh, wow. and I didn't know if it was like if it's one of these like I'm not the most technical person but um I could show you I can't reenact it you know what I mean I can kind of show you when it happens like it just happened again and I'm finally like okay something's going on here um I'm clicking around right now maybe it'll happen while we're on the phone but um you know, basically, you know, wherever I am in the workflow, I have to log back in, pull up the roll-up list I was working on and start again. And now it's happening so much. It's like, it's really starting to prevent me from being effective working. Cause it's, you know what I mean? I'm losing my place on the roll-up list. You know what I mean? It's, it's ruining my day, so to speak. Okay. Um, so can you log into my system and make sure like everything is the way it's supposed to be like is there a is there a download like is there has there been an update i'm not aware of um well if there was an update and you're on the asp then you would just have the updated code immediately uh you don't have to you specifically you do not have to update it or anything like that um and and you're saying it could happen at any point like there's no specific action you're doing it's like at any point in time correct that is correct There's no specific action. You know, a lot of times I'm working off of roll-up lists. So that's probably something that's more consistent than anything. But, yeah, it just happens. And basically, throughout my day, I am logging back into my PC Recorder homepage, you know, the login screen, you know, that says what's new, 07, PCR capture update 2.1.2. you know that's why i was thinking is it is it a is it a plug-in or i don't know no the capture tool shouldn't have an effect on the actual um the browser login um so did you you said for the last four or five weeks it it wasn't happening before that time no it was never happening and then it just it started happening and it started happening more you know and I've been working a lot more hours lately so now it's starting to happen a lot and it's starting to drive me nuts okay did you four or five weeks ago did you change anything about uh your office no my computer computer nope I have a new ISP internet no nothing has changed I I have had a Mac for years um I haven't changed my internet um there's not nothing has changed on my computer. You know, I know sometimes I've had issues before where I have to go to downloads, not downloads. What is it? Oh, delete browsing data. I've had to do that before. I know that sometimes I use PCR mail and I know I've had issues with mail before where they've suggested going in and deleting cache images and files. I don't know if I have too much browsing history. You know what I mean? I'm not really sure what to do. Let me ruminate on all this information you've given me here. Just a sec there, Bob. I'm going to log in to your database. Yeah, give me one second. Okay. Yep, it's default database. All right. What company are you with? There's a couple Bob Sullivans, actually. Accountants Direct, Atlanta CPA Search, one of those. Okay. Yep, that's it. Yeah. Default database. Okay, and your username? It's Bob. Just Bob, okay. And it should be Sadie321$. Okay, yeah. Yeah. got all right okay the database does not have anything in the like the whitelist ip address thing all right um Yeah, do you use a VPN? No, I don't think so. No, okay. No, I just, I have Xfinity Internet. I'm wondering, is there something wrong with my laptop? but I've had no is...
