## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Hey, Jason. This is Jeanette from Job.com. How are you? I'm good. How are you? Doing pretty good. Hey, question for you. We are trying to set up VMSs through Job Robotics in the PCR. And they told us we needed to contact Main Sequence to get a username, a password, and that the user account had to be an enterprise option. Do you know anything about that, or can you direct me to somebody who could help me set it up? You're trying to set up – say the first part again one more time. I'm so sorry. I heard username, password, and what else did you need, and for what? I'm so sorry. My headset cut out. No problem. Username, password, application ID. We already have the API key, which would just be API key, I think. so what we're doing is we're using job robotics to set up some vms's in the pcr and i know main sequence has a um it's already set up for job robotics because it's on both the websites i just don't know how to set up the account okay so um what you need to do inside of pcr is create a new user. And when you're creating the user, there's going to be a checkbox that says, is API user? You're going to click that checkbox. Basically, what that's doing is disabling the user to only function with the connection you're going to set up. The username can be whatever you choose it to be, and the password can be whatever you choose it to be. The main important thing being that you click that is API user box. Okay, great. Then that will be your username and your password. The app ID, give me one second. Let me take a look at that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I believe we recently had some changes happen with our API. That's why it's taking a second for me to dig. I believe since we've, we basically what we've done with our API is we've opened it up. Traditionally you would need an app ID and an API key. and that kind of stuff to connect to our API, but we've opened it up so that people can just kind of freely connect to it. So I believe for the app ID, it doesn't particularly matter what you put in that field. It should just connect. I think the integrations that we have existing were built when the API was closed and required app ID, API key, all of those specifics. But now it's still asking for those things, but they are not really required. So you should be able to put whatever you like in the app ID field. Okay, so I just throw a one in there. A handful of zeros. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Do you know there's a character limit? Just throw like maybe three characters in it, like one, two, three, whatever you like. Okay. Because I think that still only exists because when it was built, our API was closed, but we recently opened it up. Okay, great. Well, I'll do that then. I'm meeting with them tomorrow, and we'll just go from there. I really appreciate all your help. Yep, absolutely. You have a good day. Bye. Thank you, too. Bye-bye....
