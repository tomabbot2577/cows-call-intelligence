## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hi, it's Robbie. Hi, it's Robin. Hi, Robin. I got it. I don't know why. It was showing mail Robbie. Was that ever an email you used at any point? Just always Robbie at SummitBridgePartners.com. So when I got the email today and I opened it up, I was like, late payment? Like, I haven't gotten anything else. I wonder if that was, like, an issue, like, somewhere. Like, in the old system, you would have, like, a customer and customer email and then, like, an invoice email. Maybe it was always right in the invoice email but wrong in the customer area with the new system. But I had fixed it. Did you happen to get two of them now? I did, yes. The second one just came through. so now I just got to go look up my password everything's saved so oh so well with this billing portal if you're going to go in and do the sign up option you could just do the view and pay within oh okay so let me because you're annual all right so let me look at let me do this again so the one that says like sign up that's if you want to create like a billing account which is probably maybe better if you're more like monthly like you can go in and change your card on file and all that kind of stuff. Okay, so let me just, okay. All right, so actually one came in at 107, and that has the, there we go. Okay, I got it. I'm hitting view and pay. Okay. Perfect. All right, I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Let me see, because it's going to require a stored card. Let me turn it off for you. because you're annual your car will probably change way before then and stuff okay all right so yeah you want to stay on the phone and make sure it goes through and everything yeah i do that right now i had a weird email for you for some reason yeah that's so funny how are you doing pretty good good and did sorry oh i was just saying maybe like a one place that was correct and because the old system I think it based it would send based on what was in the actual invoice and this one is just one email from the customer area I think that's possibly 7802 all right I just hit process takes a moment all right that looks like it was paid and transaction process so yep just one thrill excellent all right thank you so much I appreciate you are welcome Have a great week. Thanks. Bye. Bye....
