## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. This is Ray George. I don't know what happened. I can't log into my PCR. Okay. It's like a vacation. Okay. So let's see. Hold on one second. I don't think I've ever had that problem. Yeah, I don't know either. Let's see. Ray George. Yeah, management recruiter question. I've got some DBA names too, but I don't think that's relevant. Okay, I can get to your login page. Is that where you're having an issue? Yeah. Okay. Let me try to... You know, it sometimes happens. Have you... Are you kind of just starting for the day? uh yeah well i've been i've been i i i logged in a little bit later but i have not been in pcr today because sometimes what happens especially it seems like over the weekend or if you're out for you know good nice holiday sometimes what happens like if you don't restart your computer even like your router it might be trying to remember a previous session and kind of just like hung up. I'll do it. Can you try restarting your computer and see if that works? Otherwise, you might have to restart your router, maybe like if you're working from home. Because it's coming up for me just fine. Yeah, I'll do a reboot. In fact, I can call you back. I don't want to tie you up. Yeah. It looks like you're, oh. are you getting into the database are you getting to the login page but you can't log in because i'm getting a it's trying to log in as ray but it has an invalid username or password looks like one time you tried our george at something but the username is just ray right i think they're they're it gives me like three or four different choices Oh, do you have like your Google password remembering? Well, I haven't changed it. So. Like if you like kind of like saving without like replacing, you might have multiple usernames possibly being saved in your browser. Well, I use two different emails. I have a recruiting business, and then I have... So the PCR username is not an email address. It's just the name right. Right. Okay. That's what it should be. Yeah. Okay. I just rebooted. See if it comes up. Yeah, because I've seen you last logged in on June 30th and then several attempts today, but you have invalid username or password. Yeah. So the username is Ray. So it appears you're probably using the wrong password. I haven't changed that password for years. But do you have your browser storing maybe different logins? That maybe you're pulling the wrong one? Looks like it's going to... The login has failed due to invalid credentials. Right. So, I can see... Yeah, what I'm seeing here, what I'm seeing here is it saying invalid username or password. So, as long as you're just using Ray for the username, it sounds like you're not using the right password. Do you have your browser remembering it? Well, no. When I click, It gives me Ray. It's defaulted when I click on the icon. So we don't store passwords because of security. It would be your browser. Like if it's auto-populating whatever the password is, it's just whatever you have saved there. Because you only have one database. And the username is Ray. So it means you're using an incorrect password. So if you have it stored in your browser, it may be stored incorrectly in your browser. Like, do you have it stored more than once? Do you use Chrome, like a Google password manager? Yeah. Okay. I did. And I just checked it. I don't know. Are you using one that says like WW2, like PCRecruiter.net? Because there's also some other PCRecruiter sites, which might be like Help Desk or things like that. Like if you go to your Google Password Manager. Okay, wait a minute. So I click on the icon. It gives me the page I'm customarily seeing when I log in, and it gives me the default database and the username Ray and the password fields. Your browser is trying to autofill it. So if you open up a new tab in your browser and then Google, do a Google search for Google password manager. Oh, okay. And it might ask you to sign in. Actually, it might give you a list, but then it'll probably ask you to sign in once you do it. one that you're looking for, it'll say PCRecruiter.net. I believe that's how it's going to be. Actually, it might even say www.PCRecruiter.net. Because I was just looking at mine, and mine's like LML. Huh. I never saw that before. Do you see one like www.peacerecruiter.net? I did. What happened to it? DC Recruiter Login, Google Search. No, no, you can't. No, so you're going to do a Google search for Google Password Manager. and then when you get to that page let me know oops okay Google password manager okay yeah here it is okay that should list sites that you had your browser save a password for? And then if you scroll down, what options do you see that have anything to do with PC Recruiter? Do you see like www.pcrecruiter.net or? It's got gosouthportsearch.com. No, that would not be us. Let's see. You know what, PC Recruiter. Oh, it's PCRecruiter.net. Okay, click the arrow next to that. Is that t...
