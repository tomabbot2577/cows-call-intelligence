## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Jasmine with Conexa Search Group. How are you doing today? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing good. I have a quick question. I don't know if it can be done. So we have the Zoom integration, right? And when we are importing candidates from Zoom, we have their emails go into, like, a custom category. It's like Zoom business email or Zoom primary email, something like that. Is there a way to do a global change on those name records to put them into the email address field rather than our custom field? No, unfortunately not. I did not think so. Yeah, you can copy from a predefined to a custom or a custom to a custom, but you can't copy to a predefined field. is there a setup like though on their end so you're starting from them is there a setup to the control on their side where it goes to no we had to map it through pcr okay and we could map it to a predefined field okay they don't let you do that okay um yeah unfortunately we don't let copy to predefine only because it um some of those values have a certain format or required or, and they don't, they can't do like a multi-values and things like that. It's just like one. So you can't copy to a predefined. I was, I didn't think so. I was just wondering. Yeah. Yeah. You can go to copy, you can go custom to custom or predefined to custom, just not the opposite way. All right. Well, I appreciate your help. Thank you. All right. You are welcome. Have a good week. You too. Bye-bye. Thanks. Bye....
