## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hey, this is Luke. Hey, Luke. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. How are you? Oh, hey. Good. How are you? I am well. Jim Wise wanted me to give you a quick call. He got your email there. He's kind of transitioning out of main sequence here slowly, so he's leaving things to me. Okay. Okay. To just kind of reach out. You had some questions on the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter. I just wanted to kind of give you a quick call back, let you know that's actually something that wouldn't increase your monthly any because you're already on the needed package. It would just be a 250 set up to get it turned on in a couple hours training should you wish to add that to the account. Okay, great. Yeah, no, that was my question. so yeah so let me uh i'll i mean 250 is like really not not a big expense and you said it won't add anything on the monthly or the i forget if our contract is annual but um it doesn't add anything on that monthly at all so that is all well and good and if you want to set up a demo let me know and i can run you through it at some point in the next week or two if you if that's of interest or need to you okay um yeah i think that would be a good thing to throw on the calendar um We don't have to do it right now. We can email about it if you want. But, yeah, no, I think I'd have interest in seeing, you know, how it works and stuff. And then it would just be $250 for the whole org, not per account. Okay, not per account at all. Well, let me – I've got the email. He forwarded it to me. I will go ahead and just reply to you so you have my email, and then we can coordinate a demo over the next coming days or weeks from there. Okay, great. And you said moving forward, it's going to be you for pretty much sales stuff. Yep. Yep. All account management, sales, adding, dropping users, all that comes through me. I've been here longer than Jim Wise was, so I know the ropes. I've been here for 26 years or so. Okay. Sounds good. Well, thanks. Thanks for reaching out. Thank you very much. Luke, you too. We'll talk to you soon. Okay. Bye....
