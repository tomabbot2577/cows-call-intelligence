## 💬 Full Transcript

 At the tone, please record your message. When you have finished recording, you may hang up. Hi, this is Robin Mentoni. I was going to give you a call about renaming a custom field. It's an option in system global changes. There's an option called rename custom field. The only thing about that, though, is if you're using it in, like, a form letter, a profile, a PCR job board, you would need to reselect it. It'll change it on your layout. But other places, like, again, form letter, job board, profile, it cannot change it there. That would have to be manually reselected. I'll shoot you an email as well. Thanks. Bye....
