## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello? Hi, this is Jason calling from Main Sequence. I think we might have just missed a call from you. Yeah, hey, Jason. It's Luke from Spectrum. Okay, awesome. How can I help you? Hey, yeah, so I've been through this like a million times. It's probably something I'm messing up on my end. We have a user and their emails are not logging in PCR in the activity. Just to give you the heads up of what I've done so far, I've gone to the email menu and made sure their mail server was logged in to Outlook. I've checked their preferences to make sure it is writing outgoing activities or writing outgoing emails to activities. I've marked their email folder like their sent folder and their trash folder. What's the username? It's EMS in the database spectrum careers. Okay. Yeah. Just give me one second. Let me take a look. Are you guys using the Outlook portal or do you normally just do it with the IMAP setup? Just the IMAP setup. Okay. And what is the email address? The email address for the user is esholtz at Spectrum Careers. Okay. the only thing I did notice that I haven't seen before is that they have multiple mail servers listed. Like they have, they have two listed for, um, office three 65. We tried deleting one, but it, it wouldn't let us. Yeah. Those, those get, uh, they're pretty deeply ingrained. Um, when did you try and, uh, When did you try and delete it? Just now. Okay. Probably 15 minutes ago. Okay. So what might be happening is if you tried to delete it, that kind of really bogs down the mail server. So it might be in the process of trying to delete it. So it might not be working very quickly or well, given that it's kind of using all of its processing power to try and remove the other one. So I would say maybe you tried to connect these around the same time. Like, when did you first set it up and notice that it wasn't writing activities? Well, I guess when I noticed it, we were talking about it like yesterday or the day before. I looked through the activity and he hasn't had an email like get logged since March. So I know that's a huge backlog. Yeah. But we, I guess we set it up like, or we re-logged in to Office 365 on the mail servers this morning. And I've just been checking activity periodically since then. It's probably been three hours or so. And I haven't seen anything log. So I just wanted to, I know that usually like it slowly gets through them. And since I hadn't seen anything, I was like, oh, maybe it's, maybe we messed up. did I imagine he's received an email since you first had like configured this I know like the last six months it hasn't nothing shown up but since you re-authenticated what was the name of it hold on it's called office 365 okay now servers email folders oh you know what i'm seeing now too i've just i've been running activity searches like every few minutes and i'm running them now and i'm seeing like one email log every every time i run it so maybe it's fixed now it's like the classic case of when i call you guys it's immediately fixed yeah it might be the the email server was that getting deleted and now it's kind of like really slowly trucking through them. I would say give it like a day if that's reasonable. And then if you're still seeing an issue, give us a call back. But if you're seeing things start to pull in, I would say it's probably working. Okay. Yeah, I'm seeing it can definitely give it a day. I'm seeing email received coming, like I guess emails, you know, coming in the inbox, like his inbox are getting logged, but I'm not seeing any, anyone's like come in for, um, emails he sent. So, and I, that number, like that number hasn't changed at all. Um, so I don't know if there's, I don't know if you guys ever run into the problem. Like if you have multiple mail servers set up, like it looks like he, it looks like he has the same mail server set up twice. and I'm wondering if it's like getting confused about where the sent, like where to look for the sent items, even though I marked to the sent folder. Yeah. Let me see which one it's marked under. Which one was the most recently set up? Was it the, the bottom one, the office 365 mail with his email listed? That's the one that we like just updated the password on, but I couldn't tell you when like both were created. Okay. Yeah, looks like there. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I see one today go to Jeff Scott with Avalon who is it? Jeff Scott with Avalon Bay Communities okay oh that's not today that is quite a few months ago that i got my oh yeah um so there is a scent to jess scott this one hasn't synced in a long time the other one hasn't pulled anything in yet yeah and that March 15th was like the last day that we had anything I think from Eric yeah so with the Office 365 mail server that got set up you said that was set up earlier today yeah Yes, like we, yeah, like we re-synced it, I guess. Okay. It doesn't seem like it's pulled anyth...
