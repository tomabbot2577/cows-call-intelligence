## 💬 Full Transcript

 This call is being recorded. Hello? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail you're having trouble with PCR. You know what? I don't know. Like, when I go on, I have no idea what's new. I can't even tell what is new. Oh, okay. So when you log into your database, you mean? so like I look you know I'm in PC Recruiter I don't know I mean is mine active I'm paying for it can you are you able to tell the new yeah I can look that up um oh PCRM you mean the the instead of PCR9 you have PCRM added to your account uh let me see and make sure it's like $85 now or whatever. Let's see here. I just can't see what's different. So you might, you would have to have a different link to get to your PCRM account. PCR9 is still going to be available. You can log in on the old link that you've always been using, but you would use a separate link to get to the PCRM version of the software. So if it looks the same, you might be using the old link. Let me send that to you right now. I could just probably have your email address. And how would I get it so it opens there? And then when my email, like I have it so it's PC Recruiter. And then if I want to inhale some, like I guess a person's resume or their data or whatever. How do I know it's going into the right? so basically it's your same database whatever you add into it will be going into that database pcrm is just a different um like a different face for it like a different uh what's the word it's the the same database it just looks different a different interactive experience on the screen. It doesn't do anything more like with AI or something? There are AI features in it. It just is a different, more user-friendly, intuitive way of navigating through your database. Okay. So let me email you that link right now. Is linda at medicalrecruiters.com or linda at Bailey's Search Associates better? Linda at medicalrecruiters.com. Okay, perfect. Yeah, Let me email you that link here. PCRM login link. Okay, I just sent that over. And I would bookmark that one if you wanna utilize the PCRM interface versus the older interface. Folder, would I make it a different one? How do I, it says favorite added PCR. Would I, what would I use as a just to distinguish between the two? M? This, yeah, PCRM is this product's name. The last one is called PCR9. it's switched over to M. Okay. Okay, and it's asking me for, oh my god, it's asking me for my password in my, okay, it's letting me enable notifications, browser notifications. okay now i'm wondering because it asked me when i signed up for this like did i want to did i use any of these other tools and they were i don't know if it was um github or who do you guys work with like other extensions like i have lucia um okay we do have um an integration partner list on our website that you could look through where a lot of those companies have built an integration that works with PCR if you have like an account with them. I could send you that as well. That would be great. I mean, what do you, is there somebody there that once I get this and I like look over it, if I don't use it, are you able to tell me what the, you know, the value is? Oh, a PCRM? Yeah, we can have our... Not the PCRM, but like the integrations. Like, I don't know what GitHub does. I don't know what, I don't use it. Oh, I see. What is it, HubSpot or some of the others? I see what you mean. Use Box or Hires. But you guys had a bunch listed, and I don't know what the value of using them are. and which I'm investing in some technology that works, like LinkedIn recruiting, the recruiter or whatever. How it does, do you guys have some kind of interaction between the two? Yeah, so for LinkedIn, we have our PCR capture tool where you're able to pull up a profile on LinkedIn or LinkedIn recruiter and hit click to add. There'll be like a button that appears on your browser. I already have that. Okay, yeah. So that's our integration we've built with LinkedIn. Besides that, let's see, nothing that I know of with LinkedIn because they require manual, with their terms and policies, you need to be manually adding persons one by one rather than bulk bringing people over. So our capture tools are best integration with LinkedIn currently. and I'm looking in our learning center there actually might be a video we did a while back with some of our about some of our integrations and partners that might be helpful in addition to the list I'm sending you but the list I'm sending you actually there's a button that says learn more under each partner and it can give you a rundown of what they do and links to their site Okay. Do you guys, have you ever spoken to Lucia or Lucia? I don't think we have an integration with them. That doesn't look like it's on this list here. Let's double check. Yeah, nothing with Lucia. I know a lot of customers do use Lucia, though, where they would grab information from Lucia and then maybe just export it as a CSV file that you can then import int...
