## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, Kaylee speaking. Hello, Kaylee. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hello, Jim. I'm fine, thanks. How are you? I'm all right. Well, I say I'm fine. I keep getting, I've got so many plates spinning, Jim. I'm confusing one thing and another. Happens to the best of us. So this AI gadget, software, whatever you call it, I heard about it through someone else. I haven't been informed from PCR that they've got that as an add-on now. So how do I get to understand more about that, Jim? Well, they actually have turned it on for everyone as a free trial for the summer. So much of it is already in your database. So what it is consisting of, it's basically four areas of the database. There's going to be three content generators and a search. So you should have the three content generators now, not the search, but I can get it if you'd like. Okay. There's going to be a little AI button on any email send screen, any job description right at the top in the description field and in the candidate summary field. That's the candidate summary generator. And there's really not much to know about them other than when you see it, click it, and it'll generate the text it's supposed to. So like this candidate summary, you just click it once, it'll take information it found on the candidates fields and in their resume and it will produce a real-time summary and then you can click it again and make another one okay yeah and similar to the job description same thing just click it have you seen the site on it that has some video I think there's a little video overview of it it's real simple it doesn't even take any training to figure it out I've just clicked on one of my records now just to see it. I've noticed a little icon thing and it says the AI generated summary will overwrite your current text. Please confirm if you would like to proceed. Yes, if you have something in your summary field don't click it because it'll overwrite it. So don't do that. So that is one issue with it that they might be going to work out but if you go to someone blank you can click it it'll generate a summary. Same with the job description and the email one is going to prompt you a little bit. It'll ask you like do you want the email to be formal instructive casual then it will say the purpose of the email is a follow-up initial contact stuff like that yeah so it will kind of produce things then you can kind of banter back and forth with it you can say that mention the sales job or talk about scheduling meeting next week or something like that and it kind of goes back and forth up to eight times okay to kind of work with that okay well I'm just I just pulled up another record where I didn't have anything in the summary box and I've clicked on it Jim and it's pulled up a remarkable summary of this candidate yeah it's kind of cool it's kind of cool so we gave it to people to try for the summer if you want to keep it it's five bucks per user per month to add down the line no setup so it's reasonable and they're going to leave it open till Labor Day the first weekend in September is when it's okay yeah no I'll definitely to be adding this to my subscription Jim definitely yeah it's great and did you want me to have the AI search added that one's not there because they need to make sure you have the Lucene search which you probably do but they have to kind of turn it on if you could please Jim that would be great sure the search is in my opinion not as good as the boolean search it's okay but it gives you the ability to say show me maybe jobs with no interviews or show me people I talked to last week or something like that so get you something to try maybe it's worth a try but I will put in a ticket have them turn that on and then if you have any questions let me know I'll pop you an email here with the link to the instruction and the video about it and then just let me know what you think you want to do if you have any questions okay Jim you've been absolute diamond thank you for your help my pleasure all right okay thanks a lot bye-bye take care bye-bye...
