## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. My name is Connie Rose. I am in your software. I'm a new employee, so I'm new to PCR software. So I'll be calling. Do you want to call and hear you again? I'm with Alexander Raymond, part of Financial Recruiters International. Okay, wait, let's see. I'm not finding you in here. Okay, I found like a different one. Bonnie Rose. Yeah. We got a few companies. Okay. How would we have the company? I'm under Alexander Raymond, but the parent company is Financial Recruiters International. Maybe under that. I have it listed that way, financial recruiters. I don't have you in the database and ours, at least. Financial Recruiters International. Okay, that's not the right one. If you look at the URL of your login page, it ends in ODBC. What do you see? Let me shut down this page that I'm in. I have saved it. There's a two at the end of this link. I'm inside a basic search is where I'm at. Where should I go to try to get you that code? So if you look at the top of the page that you're in, there's a URL that takes you to your login page. It starts at www.pcrecruiter.net, and it ends in ODBC, followed by, like, okay, what do you see after ODBC? It's under Connective Services. Oh, okay. So that was you then. Okay. All right. Let me open that up. Yeah, okay. So I did have a Connie Rose of Connective Services, but, okay. That's me. Yeah, that's how we have you listed. Okay. so what can i help you with i reloaded i've got to go back in and find my this is an unusual name so i might be able to find her maybe just a second i'm gonna go to phoenix phoenix is right here go to names i just say that why is that name not coming back up but it doesn't matter i'm going to ask the question okay i'm just going to open up the other the one contact i'm having there under preferred communication every time i try to do this um when i click well hers has already done it but normally when i click on it and i check it i can't get it to stay so should i just enter or after i do my check marks or what am i doing I honestly I'm not able to tell what the issue is by the description. Can we do a screen share? We can. Okay. Do you happen to have RingCentral? I do. You do? Okay so if you can open up your RingCentral app probably be the best way to to do this. It's open. Okay go to video and then select join. Okay. I'm still in that. I'm in week two, and all these pop-ups come up, so it takes me a minute. I'm in video where I can start, schedule, or join. Yeah, click join. Okay. I'm going to ask you for a meeting ID. Let me know when you're ready for that number. I'm ready. 050-394-810. 050-394-810. There I am. There you are. Let me open up video. Okay. And so... Okay. And you can turn on video and audio since we're already on the phone together. We're just going to see your screen. Okay. If you click share at the bottom of your meeting screen, and then make sure you select entire screen. Yeah, I'm looking for that right now. Oh, here it is. Right at the top. Okay. Can you see that? Okay, yeah, now let's show me what's going on here. So this right here is correct under this Donna. Okay, I added and I refresh the screen I say did I hit the Save button, I added a second person. Let's just name sake here. Let's do this. The names I don't know why they didn't say that is crazy. I made a big effort to save it. So here we are in a new one. Down here, where it says preferred communication, I'll just re-enter it. Preferred communication, for this person I'm gonna enter, she did her text, a work cell, a work email. So I do wanna select all, but I don't wanna deselect all. So I thought just I'd hit enter and it would save it, but it's not doing that. Okay. So let's exit out of here for a moment because you'd have to create the whole record to create this person. Okay. So let's exit out of here. Let's go into one of these existing people. Okay. So let's go in and let's go into that field. We can just kind of add it, save it, and then take it out. So if you click in that field, add personal self for just a moment. Okay. And then click your save icon, which is right after their name and company. It's that floppy disk icon. Up at the top here? Yes, that's your save. Okay, so that tells me how to do it. Yeah. I was thinking I could do it in time. No, you have to either hit save, or maybe if you click over into another field, then enter might work. you probably have to get out of that field. No, I tried that. I tried the interesting thing. So now I know. I mean, like email other maybe like click into another field so that you're just out of that box and now hit enter on your keyboard and you'll see the screen flash and then you can tell that it's saved. Okay, cool. I got you. I got you. Thank you so much. I appreciate you answering the question. Sometimes when you're in that field, you kind of got to go out of it. So if you kind of click somewhere else, like maybe into another field, then enter on your ...
