## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, good morning. Good morning, Robin. This is Sam from Legacy Digitronics. Hi, Sam. So, yeah, so I was in contact with the Main Sequence to check what are the options to delete the database. like we have a couple of database out of which we wanted to delete three. Okay. I'm sorry. Just wanted to know the process. Can you repeat what you wanted to do? Yes. So we have like what, six to seven database. Okay. Out of which we wanted to delete three. Okay. So let's see. and I believe there is a phone yeah this is on your ODBC legacy Digitronics right yes okay so you got like all client communications billings digital infinity okay of those okay so let's see Raj is the main person who has the contract I guess. I believe it has to go through him. All right, let's see. Hold on one second. Let me, so I have to put a form of the Raj to be electronically signed. I think the one I have is for creating a new database. I'm going to have to modify this for a moment and then I'll get that over to him in just a moment. Is that okay? That's okay. All right. And then in the form, I'll make sure there's a spot where you can list the database names that you would want to have removed. Sure. That'll be only one form? Yes. Yeah. You can just list. Delete database form. Yeah. I'll modify it. enough that we can kind of use this form for each database we'll just want to list the databases okay so my question other question was uh to keep uh this database open like you know um to keep it uh as it is will that be a charge for each of the databases now okay so i'm not sure So are you wanting to delete the databases? Yes, we want to delete the database, but just wanted to explore, like, if we decide to keep it, will there be a charge? Well, you have your ODBC, and then you have all the databases on there. If we delete the databases, they are gone. That's right. So if you were to keep them, they would have to stay. but that doesn't change your monthly rate I mean you still only pay $35 a month for one user okay so alright yeah so if you're going to need access to those databases then I wouldn't delete them no for now you can send a form right from to Raj we'll list all the database that you want to delete. Okay. All right. I will get that over to him. Sure. Thank you. Thank you, Robin. You're welcome. Okay. Thank you. Bye....
