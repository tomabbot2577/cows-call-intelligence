## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, how's it going? Yo. Hey, do we have to have a serial code for that AI candidate match? I can't remember. No, it's just in new 2. It's not in WW2. I'm in new 2. I'm not seeing it on mine. I'm not sure. Yeah, I didn't add anything to mine. Maybe ask Nick. And it's in just like the regular like edit position options menu, right? Yeah, if you just open up a position, go to the action menu at the top right. Can you check your database and see if you have anything? I will check. I'm actually jumping on a consulting call right now, though, so I'll check that in a second. All right. Bye. Bye....
