## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. This is Gina with J-Powers. How are you? I'm doing fine, Gina. How are you? I'm good. It's been a while since I called you, and your, what do you call this, automated greeting changed. Usually I just hit forward to get technical support, but it says that's an invalid, you know, number. I'm like, oh, okay. Yeah, we did just make changes to the phone system. Yes, we did. Sorry about that. Oh, no problem. No problem. You can tell that I haven't bugged you guys in a very long time. Well, that's good, I think. Yeah, it is. I think that's good. It is good. So I just need to pick your brain a little bit. So I captured someone in LinkedIn and put it in PCR. And then after that, I found all the information for this person in Zoom info. So I tried to click to update from Zoom info to PCR. And I noticed, and it's been a while, I've been noticing it, that not all the phone numbers that's being captured in Zoom is being entered in PCR. So should I talk to you about this or should I go directly to Zoom info and maybe they can help me with, I don't know if it's a, I'm not exactly sure the term, a coding issue or something like that? This would be in our, it's our tool, right? You're using the capture tool, the extension. Yeah. So that's our, that's our tool. Zoom info would be like, what, what are you talking about? They, yeah, they don't know. Okay. So the capture tool, the way it works is it's a bunch of code that is looking for very specific things on very specific websites. and we support the ZoomInfo website. So at some point in time in the past, a developer on our end went through and was staring at the ZoomInfo website and the backend code for the website. And then he made code specifically to look at this type of website. And over time, companies like ZoomInfo, they change their websites, right? So it could be that they changed some sort of element on the screen or they moved something or, you know, hid like some backend like element that the capture tool was looking for. And so since those changes happen, like the capture tool will appear to be broken because it's like looking for something that is no longer there. And that's kind of the, that's kind of the ebb and flow of how the capture tool works. It's kind of like, we'll make it work. And then over time, web developers of the target websites will change stuff and then it'll like slightly break. And then We'll have to like report that as a bug and then the developer will fix it and it'll work for, you know, another six months or whatever. And it's kind of like a ongoing battle of developers there versus developers here because they don't really like us scraping their data. Right. So they I think they do this sort of thing on purpose. Like every so often they like change stuff. So scraping tools of this nature don't work as well. Well, that's not good for us, the user, because, you know, we were like, oh, everything should be there. but hey, hold on. The business phone number is, it is captured, so I have to cut and paste it. So is there a resolution for this or do I just continue cutting and pasting? The best thing we can do if you'd like to get that to be working again is if I like hop on, maybe we hop on like a quick screen share. I would like to like walk through it with you and like see an example of it like not working and I'll take like a screenshot and I can make like a ticket and it'll say, you know, the capture tool on Zoom website, no longer see this phone field or whatever it may be. And then I can maybe fix it. But I do need to kind of clarify a few things because there could be like, maybe you have some really advanced setup and maybe you've oversimplified it in words. And so I kind of do need to see it to be 100% sure on that so let's do a screen share if you don't mind um no problem i usually just use meet.google.com and you can just go there as well m-e-e-t.google.com and then there should be like a box that you could enter a code it says enter a code or nickname that will be in the middle of the screen and third code yes let's go and the code is going to be 10 letters. So it's going to be P, W, S, V as in Victor, D as in dog, Z as in zebra, B as in boy. They chose all the letters that are hard. S, D as in dog, Z as in zebra. So again, fast. P, W S V D Z B S D Z. And then it should ask, you should ask to join the meeting, make sure to mute and like, you can also turn your camera off in the Google meet. You don't need to. Oh, what about the mute? We don't need to mute. In the Google meeting. Yeah. You don't need to talk. So you can mute yourself and hide your camera. And then I, okay, got it. You really, we're only just using the, like the screen share. The screen share. Got it. Okay. So I did all that. Okay. All right. At the bottom there should be share screen and then pick your screen and I'm just going to walk through. I might take a couple...
