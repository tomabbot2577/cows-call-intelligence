## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just... You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Bear with me here. Certainly. How you doing, sir? I am very well. How are you? I'm good. I'm pretty well for Friday. Thank you. Excellent. Excellent. Am I coming through okay for you? We just moved, Jim, and I'm still working on the technical pieces, so I'm not sure this is my first kind of Teams or Zoom call. You come through just fine, just fine. Okay, excellent. Awesome, awesome. Yeah, so I want to show you around PC Recruiter today. And before I share my screen and kind of show you around, just wondered what were kind of the main features you need or what are the main things you need the software to do, be it ours or anyone's? Jim, to give you some background in terms of, you know, with where, what I'm looking to do, and ultimately, you know, I have been in the corporate world for a while. And I've used from, I guess I would call it a larger scale or enterprise level usage and pretty familiar with a few different tools, applicant tracking tools to, you know, within that environment. And so I'm kind of in a bit of a transition period in my career right now where in the purpose for reaching out to you and initially through Jim is that I'm looking to kind of hang my own shingle and have been doing that, working in that direction and a crazy time to do it, but ultimately in terms of place individuals in different organizations, but also looking to do business development. And so in tracking all of that, Jim, so, you know, I've had some conversations and with a few folks, one of those being John Busey, who knows Jim Wise, I guess they know each other pretty well. I think you, I have mentioned that to you in the past, and they go back a number of years. And John had recommended, and I'm doing business with John and his partner at an organization, and growing that business with other organizations. But ultimately, what I believe is to help grow my business. I'm a solo person, plan to stay solo at least for the foreseeable future. But my two main avenues are to grow my network of individuals. Part of what I'm using primarily right now is LinkedIn Recruiter, LinkedIn Recruiter Lite, some clearance job efforts, but then also just the good old-fashioned other avenues and social networking, a little bit of that, but primarily networking as well. I would consider myself an old school recruiter. I've learned some of the newer things that are out there through maybe some AI enhancements or tools, chat GPT, that sort of thing. I wouldn't consider myself by any means an expert at those, but kind of learning as I'm going. But really trying to grow this, doing so, I expect to make a decision, Jim, on PC Recruiter or another platform within probably the next four to six weeks at the top end. And that may be a little bit slow, but just wanting to get things moving forward. Just at this time, kind of getting things adjusted, getting my ducks in a row, for lack of a better term, and getting things moving in terms of the business itself. Sure, sure. And hopefully that helps you, just to paint some broader strokes, I guess, just in terms of a little bit of history and trajectory-wise. And certainly happy to answer any questions you have to help you. Sure. And just kind of looking for basic tracking of candidates, positions, companies, interviews, emails, contact, everything like that? Yes. Okay. Very well. Very well. Yeah. So let me show you what I'm seeing right now, Jim. Now, that may grow. That's one of those that my vision on this is probably not where it will be, let's say, in six months, but that's what I'm seeing at this point. Okay, perfect. Perfect. Well, yeah, let me show you around some of the system here. I'll share my screen, kind of show you the basics, take questions as we go. It's the best way to take a look at a demo, I think, so that'll work well. So, let's see. That sounds great. Perfect. So, I'm going to share my screen here. You should momentarily be looking at a sign-in screen for PC Recruiter. Okay. You see that all right? It's coming up. You bet. Perfect. Perfect. So this is our sign-in. So I'm going to show you just kind of the basic system here. It's all cloud-based, so it's going to be something that will run on a PC or a Mac, pretty much any browser. So you have a lot of flexibility in how you access the system. There's a mobile app as well, so you can access it remotely too. So you're going to have a username and password. That will get you into the system. Once you are logged in, it's going to look more or less like this. And really, it's very configurable. So you have the ability to put your own fields in here, show or hide various different buttons or elements or actions on the screen. You're going to have the ability to kind of set up a lot of your own configuration option...
