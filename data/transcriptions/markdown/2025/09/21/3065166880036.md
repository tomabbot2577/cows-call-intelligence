## 💬 Full Transcript

 Calling main sequence. This is Robin. Can't hear anything. Hello, can you hear me? Yes, can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. For some reason, I couldn't hear you at first. I apologize for that. All right. So I have come across an issue regarding the PCR sequencing. Okay. And your name is? My name is Tahereen, but I am doing it for my client. His name is John Lichtman, on which the PCR account is on. Okay. And what is occurring? What's going on? Okay, so I ran the sequence yesterday, but before that, I also ran two test sequences. The test sequences were successful. I also received the emails from them, from those sequences. But when I ran the final sequence, the emails did not go out. Even though everything is fine, I checked my laptop's time, and all the settings are correct, but nobody received the email, and it is also not in the outbook of my client. Okay. What is the name of the database that this is starting from? It is called Heart for Home Database. Okay. And what is the username? Yes, that is Jay Littman. Okay. Okay. Are you asking about the username or the email address? The username. That is JXL. Okay, let's see. Oh, he's got email credentials, it looks like, in this database. He has three or four databases, and I'm working on one of them. That is called Hard Work Home Database. Right, but he's got multiple aliases. Do you know which one you used? Was it like the Office 365, the SendGrid? No, I used the Office 365. Okay, one issue could be, let me test that one. There is no delay between emails, which is going to be super important. Okay, so let me add a delay on that one. So, what sequence you're talking about? I haven't even looked at the sequence yet. I was looking at the alias list, which is used for sending the emails. There was no delay. So, a lot of times Office 365 will like block it or like stop sending only because like they're all getting time stamped in for the exact same moment. Office 365 also has a per limit restriction. What was the name of the sequence that you were using? Give me a second. The name of the sequence is NPC Leslie first batch. Okay I'm gonna have to pause it for a moment so that I can and look at what is going on in the sequence itself. Okay. Yeah, sure. It goes out from 11. Yeah, it goes. So it runs from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. And there was no rate limiter. Okay. And let me see. And 21 names. And it's not too bad. It was the NPC Leslie first batch. right? Okay. Yes. And just below that, there's a test sequence which I ran yesterday on two to three emails of microleaf, and that sequence went out completely fine. We all received the emails. And I'm sorry, what was that again? Can you say that again? There's also another test campaign. There's also another test campaign that is also running right now, and I added two to three my email addresses there, and I received the email from there, like on the test campaign. Okay. Well, actually, hold on one second. I think I know why. On this Leslie First batch one. When you pause this sequence, that automatic letter is set to send from the SendGrid John Littman alias. That alias is failing. Okay. So what I mean by that. Is it not going out from MS Office email address? No. That particular sequence, it has, if you go to, if you're logged in as him, if you go to system and go down to email setup, click system on the main toolbar. Yeah. Go down to email setup. Okay. Yes. And go to email alias list. Yes. Okay, there's four cards. This particular sequence is not sending through his Office 365. At least that first step is configured to use the SendGrid John Littman. So when you open up that card by clicking the edit symbol and hit test connection, it's saying authentication failed maximum credit succeeded so basically he's overused that SendGrid account and it won't let him send those emails okay and what if I send it from the Microsoft office would it go out it could because it is at least smaller but I think for this one you might have to almost like read you would need to change the sequence so it uses that first email alias okay if I like this edit the campaign right now like you probably you'd have to pause it and then probably just redo it yes that's what I'm doing yeah so you'd have to go with But, yeah, go ahead and edit your template. Make sure it's using the right alias, that first one, that Office 365. And I did add a delay, so that's also going to help with delivery for that Office 365. But, yeah, that SendGrid one is giving an error that he's exceeded his credits from SendGrid. Okay. So now I have changed the email address. And if I unpause the campaign, like I run it right now, so the people can get it. Yeah, you won't be able to do that. If you change the template and then you change the sequence already activated, it's probably kind of already stuck. I would just end that sequence, like pause it and then end it. And create a new one. Yeah, and then just create a new one. Just make sure you pause it and then end it,...
