 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Otherwise, you are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one.

I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. you Jim? Yeah. You hear me? Good morning, Brian. Yeah. How are you? Doing good. How are you doing? Not bad. Not bad at all. Did you have a good fourth? I did. I did. We had the next couple days off and saw all kinds of people and did all kinds of things. It was a little hot here than usual, like 80s and 90s, but it could be worse. No rain, at least. That's good. Does it not get normally in the 80s up there? Not for as many days as we've had. We had low 90s for several days in a row. Sometimes, but not all that often. Maybe once a summer it might get quite that hot for any length of time, but it's been really hot lately. Yeah, you guys have cold winters, though. Yeah, we usually do. Do you get sick of that, or do you like it? I don't mind it. By the end of the winter, it gets a little tiring, but I like the change. It's nice, and I've been here all my life, so I kind of like the change of seasons. It only gets tiring toward the end when you're ready for it to warm up, and it's just hanging on. We're right on the lake, so we are kind of three weeks behind everyone else here, which is nice in the fall because our summer kind of extends well into September, early October because the lake keeps us warm, but the lake in the spring also acts like a refrigerator and keeps us cold. So those first couple 70-degree days, it's like 55 up here. So kind of a bummer that it holds on because the lake really keeps us cool. We're only about a mile, mile and a half inland from the lake. Nice. That's great. You go use the lake, or do you get out? I do. We don't boat or anything. Boats make me barf. But we swim and we go up there all the time and hike and run along the lake. Okay, gotcha. kayak a little bit. I'm the complete opposite. Anytime I'm on a boat, I'm a happy man. If I'm moving, I'm okay, but as soon as we stop, it's all bad. I see. I got you. Very cool. Well, good, man. Good, good, good. So yeah, I want to see what you got. For sure, for sure. So yeah, so I want to talk a little bit about some of the premium features that you don't have, and then we'll look at the PCRM piece as well. The PCRM is primarily like it adds its all new interface, which we'll take a look at. It has most of what the PC Recruiter has now. It adds a sales pipeline. It adds a simpler sequencing piece. So it adds kind of some CRM functionality. So it makes a whole CRM product and kind of gives you another portal to log onto. But I want to show you first of all what's included in the premium, which is the kind of the higher end version that you don't have of PC Recruiter. So with that, that premium is going to add, notably, it's going to add email campaign features, our new sequencing feature, and analytics reporting. Those are going to be notable things it's going to add. And you can also have, there's an AI suite you can add in to that as well that we can make part of the premium package. So some content generators in there as well. So I'm going to log into my database just to kind of show you kind of what that might look like and how that will work. Do you use the bulk email capabilities in PCRecruiter at all? I don't even know what that is. Okay. So, yeah. So what you can do, you can send an email to all lists of people, essentially, a mass email. So kind of to start with that, if you have a roll-up list, so I'm in PCR9 now, and if I go into my roll-up list here, the email campaigns is going to allow you to select a whole roll-up list of people from a roll-up list or search result or anything like that. and when you go to the letter option it's going to let you kind of build a library of campaigns so you can kind of build different campaigns in there maybe I want this one to update contact information so if I select that campaign you can categorize them they're all going to be based off of a specific form letter that's in your database then it's going to go to a selected set of names you have the option to send it to maybe their primary email address nine times out of ten that's what you do but if you happen to have a second email or a home email address you could send it to everybody's secondary email address if you ever needed to it also gives you nice ability to kind of pick a different alias so if you had maybe a send grid or something to be able to send not f...
