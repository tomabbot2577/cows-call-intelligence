## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hello. What are you doing? Hi. Working. I just left Tina Roberts a message. She was on my voicemail, but I just wanted to close the loop and make sure she was set. But she is all squared away, isn't she? I voided the July one. I don't know if maybe like thought that was like a second user or something, but apparently she only has one. So I'm not really sure why there was a six-month invoice covering like two rows of the same thing and then the next one was six months later. So she already paid that one in January, which she did. I deleted the one in January, July. I do have the next one going in, was it December or January, January 1st again, only because I think it's better to stick with the six months for now. because then it aligns more with the contract date because if she prepays and then cancels, then there's six months that, you know what I mean? I do. Excuse me. So because she replied, like, it doesn't matter if it's six months or a year, but at least the next one I'd rather do is six months because it's harder to align with contract dates. Otherwise, it gets really messy doing a prepay annually. Mm-hmm. I don't know what he's talking about. It's a bug. It's fucking it up. I don't need to go through 59 steps. It looks like shit. It's a bug. Yeah, if you send a form letter, it merges, like, whether it's pipeline email or name letter, and you have it merging in summary, it's adding all this extra spacing. Ooh. Yeah, it looks like shit. so you can have it look perfect in your summary and then when you go to email it it's got all this extra spacing for some reason that's so good so it's like a lot of clean up looks like shit I don't know I hate PCRM it opens the same window it's the same HTML code it's the same window doesn't make a difference so anyway I wanted to show you can I do a meeting with you what I did. You can tell me if you like it or if you don't. No offense. I just thought it might be a little bit easier for me because I'm only going to do this for you once a month for me to remember. It might be easier for both of us. Yeah. Open up your RingCentral and I'll give you a meeting ID. Actually, just put Robin Mantone all as one word. Open up my RingCentral. Oh, but it has to be new RingCentral, doesn't it? yeah I use the old interface because the new interface I just don't like oh really oh get everything on one place so much better I don't know how to get into it now and your windows search just type the word ring and it'll just say ring central with the word app underneath it app got it okay yeah that's the one it opens for me oops so it's still up in the old one that is the website I don't need the website I don't know what he's gonna show you what I mean it doesn't matter it's a template it's merging it in shitty I don't know I don't need to change my process for something that doesn't work I don't know what I'm Do you want to just do a Google Meet? Yeah, let's do a Google Meet. Okay. Hold on one second. Return to meeting. Hold on one second. Let's see. Meet. New meeting. Start an instant. There you go. Meanwhile, I will start to share my screen. Ask to join. okay okay all right so let me find what I did with it hold on one second close close oh that was yours original that's okay so I only did like two rows as an example we might want to do some tweaks because I just want to see if this if you even like this if it would even work drive okay so I made this thing and we could just call it whatever because I think you could probably just like copy as a new tab or whatever if you want to do like like duplicate or you know what I mean make a tab a month yeah if you wanted to or just replace it oh let me fix the spelling of this okay so here's what I did you would just have to list in here how you normally do then all you have to do is what was the upgrade fee or like like a one-time kind of thing so this one like I just did like two examples from your your sheet so that's if my formulas work that was a setup there's going to be one user $50 a month and then this will automatically calculate for six months for you oh cool cool so you can just say like oh they're going to be two users and then I see how it changes to 600 for you mm-hmm or if I do three users for 75 and that way is then it then it take this amount and and then this amount and calculates it here. Oh, the total. Okay. So that way you don't have to worry about that. And if it's easier for you, this is no extra work for me, so I think it's certainly a good idea. It might just be a little bit clearer, like how many users, what's the – now this would be – at first I had it where you just put one amount, but then I'm like, eh, maybe we'll do like three users. And that way we could always see, like two users, 50 a month. Actually, this one might be a little bit weird because this is the one I was getting a little more concerned about. Like it's always six months, right? Or do we want a column for how many months? Always six month...
