## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Glenn Grayson at J. Aaron Associates. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good. I got a question for you. Okay. I have finally decided to make a transition to RingCentral from my traditional phone. and I have everything installed and I was under the impression that like if I just hovered over a phone number and PCR that I could direct click to dial from that okay so it's working on every other website so like LinkedIn or whatever even it's even working on my email through my PCR mail But on a name record, it's not working. So do you have any suggestions? So it could be a couple things. There might be some setup that has to be done within PCR or a change in the setup. Or it could be the app that you're using. Did you only do, like, the Chrome extension, or did you actually download the desktop app? So, you know what, I think I just have the Chrome extension. Okay, that could be it. And let me just check something here. What database do you log into and what username? I don't need the password. I see you have J. Aaron Associates and J. Aaron HCP. Yeah, the HCP one honestly could be deleted. I thought I had asked them to do that anyway. But the J. Aaron Associates one and then G. Grayson is the one that I log on. Let me just see here. Oh, I don't even see it enabled in this database. Oh wait a minute, hold on, I could be wrong. Brain fart there. No, it's not enabled in the database. Okay, hold on one second. I've got to do a couple things here. And we might need to make sure you have the right app. Okay, so I need to install the feature on your database. Okay, here's what I'm going to have you do. I'm going to have you go to System on the main toolbar in Peace Recruiter. Okay. Go to Users. Okay. And then go to Manage Users. Okay. Click on your username. Okay. And then under where it says Contact Information, where it says Contact Phone, is that your direct RingCentral number that they gave you, like the primary one for you? so that is going to be the primary number yes um it's being ported over at the moment from from comcast so it's not active in ring central quite yet okay that could also end up being a little bit of an issue but i'd also if that's the direct number for you then you would remove your office extension and one of the reasons is let's say when you get into texting um that you have like this will be the number that'll say like text subscribe to or things like that so that we can merge it in the next thing that you'll want to do is next to that contact phone field click the gear icon okay so I enabled it for the database you should now see in the sidebar ring central I see you okay what you'll need to do is put in your ring central direct number but it has in And no extension, but it has to be in that plus one format that you see above. Okay. Okay. So go and put that in. And there's going to be two more things we need to do after that. All right. Let's see. It's a temporary number at the moment, so I'm just trying to find it. Yeah. You're going to have to change all this then after you get that final number. And that's okay. As long as I know that it's working properly, then I know that I can – let me get rid of that. Then I can – I can usually remember stuff like this pretty easily, so I can just go back in. And I can also send you instructions, too. Don't worry about that. All right. So I'm just going to pull up my account here so I can get the actual phone number. Okay. Just copy and paste them. Just make sure it's in that plus one format. And then no parentheses and no dashes or anything like that, right? Right, yeah. Just plus one and the digits. Okay, so that is in there. Okay, and the other thing you'll want to do is where it says user phone configuration, go into that drop-down because it defaults to RingCentral desktop phone, which is basically a standalone phone version that they don't even support anymore. You'll want to make sure that you select RingCentral app in that drop-down. Okay. Okay. And then go ahead and hit save with those details so far. And let me know when you've done that. Okay. It says invalid RingCentral credentials. Okay. Yeah, we're not locked in yet. Oh, wait, hold on. I missed. That phone number, it also needed to be in direct dial. So I'm going to add that back in there. okay all right let's go back next to that contact phone field and hit the gear icon again so close any window that you may be in because I forgot to tell you to make sure you put under not only phone number but direct dial okay so I am back up in there okay so you should see the number in the phone and direct dial and over at the right has ring central app now see where it authenticate you'll have to click on that. Authenticate okay. And sign into your RingCentral account. Now this step here can also be done from what's called the myPCR page. Okay all right I'm should be authenticated. Okay and then let me know when ...
