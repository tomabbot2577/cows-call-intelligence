## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey Robin, Alyssa at HCP. How are you doing? Oh, pretty good. How are you doing? I'm all right. It's been a minute. Certainly interesting times out there in the world of recruiting. I wanted to just have you talk me through it so I don't mess it up, but we're changing the email alias on the admin login, and I just wanted to make sure, like, it was done correctly. Okay, let's take a look here. Yeah. Because right now it says Steve Holmes' email, and I need it to say somebody else's. Okay, so it's the admin username, right? Yes, ma'am. okay so it's not for like automated out by the databases when that person's actually logged in okay correct okay let me see what they have set up to that because if they're set up for incoming that might need a change too okay What is the name of the trash folder that you use? Is it because there's deleted messages and then there's trash? I'm going to go to Maureen's desk and just we'll do it from where it's logged in. Maureen, can I borrow your computer? Yeah. It would actually be like on that email account. You have a sent folder to find, but you don't have a trash folder. So if you were to ever delete an email out of PCR mail, then you know which one it goes into. Yeah, yeah. I just want to fix your email. All right. So let me go to email. I don't even see this working right. What the heck is going on? Yeah, well, to be perfectly frank, nobody, you know, admin has ever really used the PCML. So I need to set my admin assistant to use it. Yeah, it's not even downloading. It's not even connecting to a server. Yeah, it doesn't. I wonder if the server is not even good. Which one do you use? use recruiter yes I use recruiter let me just see what yours is just to make sure I'm giving you yeah because I'm in her I'm on you know Maureen's desk so I'm logged into her PCR mail I'm looking at her uh system login um hold on you gotta be hold on once yeah she's logged in as admin Okay. What is the, why is this not? Because what I'm looking at right now, it says Steve Mills, Steve Holmes. Yeah, that's not even, there's other things going on here too. Okay. Get it squared away. Okay, so the mail server, at least for incoming, is not even connected because it has a bad server name. Okay. Okay. So you are hosted by Office 365, it looks like, right? Correct. Yes. Okay. So here's what you're going to want to do. Do you want to do a screen share? Sure. Yeah, I'm on Maureen's computer, so do you want me to do it from her RingCentral? Oh, yeah, let's do RingCentral. Okay. Let me pop up RingCentral. Yeah, if you have RingCentral. Let me pop up her main RingCentral. We do. What the hell? Where's her? All right. Oh, here it is. Okay, so you want me to go to video. Yeah, and then click join. Join. Meeting ID, please. Meeting ID is 050. 394 810 oh well that's interesting hold on give it to me again her num lock key wasn't enabled 050 394 810 joining okay all right here's I'm going to have you do I'm going to continue without audio because we're on this call yes okay all right you want me to share screen yeah but make sure you go to entire screen I believe should be at the top uh-huh so entire screen but it's going to be entire screen screen to which is where the application is sitting okay I just pinched you have more than one monitor yeah where the multiple monitor crowd gotta be anymore insane I know when I'm traveling and I'm I've just got my laptop screen. I'm like, well, I can't function. Oh, I know. I go to like a medical appointment every eight weeks for like this IV, and I bring my computer, and it's like, oh, my gosh. Like I can't function like this. Okay. First world problem. So let's just exit out of here because I'm going to set it up where she gets not only sending but also incoming. Of course. Yes, please. Yeah. All right. So do you want me to just give you remote control, or what do you want? No, go ahead and log. go over to her main tab of Peace Recruiter. So you can exit this. It looks like you're free to exit. Yeah, I'm in email. I'm sorry. Go ahead and go down to those second and third tabs. You know me, I'm a multi-tab kind of girl. And I think what we want is that one. what the one oh you're just close okay so let's go it's a very top right a piece of recruiter where you would have the user image and the edge of that user image go to the gear go to email okay it's gonna take a moment to look so this other one called HC pursuit that's the one that's not even connecting is his incoming server and the outgoing server they're not even connecting so let's go to configure this is oh this is a bunch of old shit that i don't think we need to be perfectly honest i don't care if we delete the whole thing okay this is old stuff from if you look at the dates you know yeah because they haven't even been connecting okay so let's go to configure so mail servers is where we get that box with all the subfolders let's go to mail servers and for that ...
