So I went to Edge. Even if I close Chrome, it opens it up and goes to Edge. So I closed it. I pasted it in Edge, and now it's giving me something. I just want to make sure it's the right thing. Is it capture1.com? Is it bringing you to, like, a page to, like, download the extension? I'm not sure. I mean, it says scan QR, you know, for Bing. Can we just do it? Is it possible on Edge?
