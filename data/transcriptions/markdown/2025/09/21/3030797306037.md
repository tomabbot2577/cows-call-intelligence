## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is George. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I saw your voicemail. Did you end up getting a hold of your IT team? Yeah, yeah, I did. I did. And his name is Dustin Howard, and he's in the eastern time zone. I think he's in North Carolina. And he looked at those domain settings that you mentioned, the SPF and the other two. He said he didn't see any issues there. I would suggest that, if you don't mind, that you call him directly. Would that work for you? Yeah, I can give him a call. He's waiting for your call. His name is Dustin, D-U-S-T-E-N, and then Howard. And let me give you his number. Do you have a pen and paper? Sure, yeah. It's 704.431.3851. He suggested for the interim maybe trying to see if I could send an email on webmail. And I just tested that out, and it looks like it did go through. Does that make sense? that we could send it out in web mail, if not PCR. I'd like to get the PCR working ASAP. I appreciate you getting back to me. Yeah, no problem. I'll give Dustin a call right now and we'll continue to troubleshoot. Yeah, and if you could either call me or text me or email me the outcome of your call with him so I'm in the loop on it. I'd appreciate it. awesome all right we'll talk to you soon okay garrett thank you thanks...
