## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. This is Michael. I've got an open ticket and just been open for a couple days, and I'm just trying to add an email address or email to PCR, and I wonder if you have time to walk me through that. Yeah, absolutely. No, that's all right. So you're just adding an email alias? No, I've got a new user that's going to be starting next week. So I set them up in PCR as a user. And then I created an email address for them with GoDaddy, same as I have mine. I'm just a small shop, so it's just me right now. I'm not used to adding users. but I do have a valid email address. It's GoDaddy uses Microsoft. So when I set mine up a couple of weeks ago, well, anyway, I had this business for many years and then I shut it down for a year and I just restarted. So one of your trainers actually walked through and set up that initial email and I just have a new user starting and need to be stepped through that. Yeah, absolutely. Let's jump on a screen share and I can walk you through that. No problem. Okay. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. And let me know when you're ready for the meeting ID. Yep. Okay. That is 202-249-733. Okay, RingCentral, open RingCentral to join. You can either join through the browser or open your RingCentral program. Either way will work. Sorry, that thing popped up and I said no to it too quickly. Always – let's see, there we go, join using browser. Cool. I see you joined. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Sorry, there we go. All right. Perfect. So I've got – do you want me to be in that user's TCR? Yeah. yeah signed in as that user perfect this is and then yep you go to a piece here yeah you already have a piece here mail excellent so go to configure at the top left and then start by going to mail servers right below that yeah you'll see right here this guy used to work for me this is an old email that's no longer valid. And then this is my attempt so far to set that up on my own. I can delete it and we can start over. Yeah, let's just check on that one. So use the action drop down to the left to edit. For some reason, I got a super small window here, but I don't know if I can. Oh, okay. I think that's just a issue with cache. So actually click on the three dots at the top right of your browser. And then go down to More Tools towards the bottom. Perfect. And then Developer Tools. And that'll open some coding on the right. You can just ignore all of that. And then up to the left of your web address at the top of your screen, right-click, and on the refresh button and select empty cache and hard reload. So that'll slowly reload the page, kind of clear the cache. What happens is sometimes we'll push little updates to the software, you know, every so often, a couple times a month. And some computers require a full clearing of the cache to display properly. So I think that's all that happened with the pop-up there. I wouldn't have been able to figure that out in a lifetime. Okay. And just you can clear that or click the X at the top right of those coding. There you go. All right, let's try that again. So go to Configure at the top left, Mail Servers at the top there, and then edit that bottom one. Excellent. Okay. Okay. So for this connection... I've got mine. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. So sorry to interrupt. So I was trying to do this on my own. So I've got... Okay. Let me... Can we copy paste from mine? uh so with our uh email connections you're gonna have to use the button we provide that says sign in with microsoft um so that'll because it kind of requires that type of connection that the that button gives you it's like an encrypted one and um is that not the right email account? It's not. It goes to my... Yeah, I thought so. Yeah, go ahead and hit close on that pop-up window. And then edit that bottom mail server again. And then click on sign in with Microsoft. All right, and then hit back. And say, use another account, and then sign into the correct account. Perfect. Hit next. So, I don't think... I can try this. Because I just, so I'll try it and see what happens. You can, yeah, there you go. Oh, okay. So you can close out of this pop-up window and hit sign in with Microsoft again. Let's try that again. I don't know. It kind of took us down the wrong path. Yeah, select that one. Awesome. And then where it says save sent email to sent items folder, switch that to no. Microsoft will duplicate the sent items. Yeah, perfect. then go to test connection at the bottom and we got green lettering excellent close that test and you leave at the bottom they're awesome yeah happy to help this so that's the the mail server side that's all the incoming mail so you could close that pop-up and then we'll do the outgoin...
