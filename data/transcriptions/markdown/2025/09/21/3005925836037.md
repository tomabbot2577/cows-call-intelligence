## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, hi. It's Annie from Triumph Staffing. How are you, Garrett? Good. How are you? Hey, I'm fine. Thank you. I've got a quick question. Michael BG only asked me for a report. Let me read it to you. He says, is there a way you can get me a list of placements? placements we have made since 2019 with PEO companies. Now, I know we can't do that, so he's dreaming, right? And then he says, if you can, all sales perm. Past employees were part of this. I need them included as well. Now, the only thing I can see on perm placements is to go to where it says placement reports, permanent hire summary placement report, and to kind of do it from there. Is that the only way I can do it? Yeah, let me double check. That's the one I was thinking of too as soon as you mentioned it. I'll just check under reports. You see, the problem with this is if I filter by username, there's only like the people that work their hair right now, like past employees doesn't show up on this username. so the only thing I can do is to just hit all without putting the username in there but then everyone's placement pulls in and then when I export it to Excel because there's so much information on it it won't let me sort it just to delete the ones I don't want oh it's having trouble sorting in Excel even? it doesn't sort it up if you want to come in I can show you Sure. Okay. Yeah, let's do a quick screen share. Just go to a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay. What's the ID? One second. That's firing up right now. Very slowly. Okay, meeting ID is 251-517-516. Awesome. And you can continue without audio if it asks and just share with the blue button. Oh, that's loading. Yep. I could see that. Okay. So here I am. So. Okay. So I want to explore. So, okay. All right. And the first part of it, you mentioned placement since 2019 at certain types of companies. Yeah, PEO. I don't know what the frig is PEO, so he can figure it out himself. I'm not killing myself for this report. Okay. Yeah, if he has PEO kind of listed somewhere on those company records, You could make a roll-up list of quote-unquote PEO companies and then run this report with a roll-up list as its filter. Okay. Okay. So you see this? Okay. So, which is fine, but if I wanted to, let's take this out. I see how that, yeah, that format doesn't let you, okay. Yeah. If I wanted to do it by name. Okay. Yeah, let me take a look here. Placement. Let's do permanent hire summary place. Let's see if there's a different way to do this. I'm not going to be It's deleting it individually. He gets what he gets unless he wants to do it himself. It might be another way. Right here I have the option to order by placement username. I'm going to see if that comes up with anything else. Let me try exporting it as a... Should I get out of this? Yeah, feel free to close that. Let's see. I know that you can go into the username. And then the others. So at the top left under the search params there, it says order by. You have placement date, but you could also order by user instead. It's at the top left, order by, a little bit higher. Placement right below that. I don't know if that'll help. I'm just running one in my test database now where you change the order by to instead of placement date to username. It's downloading now. Okay, so I'm checking my test database. Yeah. See if that comes up in the exact same format or something more useful. Let's see. Let me just reply to Warren. Hold on. Okay. Ah. Okay. Hold on. I'm so sorry. Let me. No problem. Yeah, I'll pause. Okay. So, yeah, if you order by that placement username and you have the right date range in there, let's take a look at that Excel file that it comes out with. It'll look the same, but at least it'll be sorted in chunks by username. So you could select a huge set of rows and delete certain usernames you don't want to look at. Okay, so it's looking like, all right, so it's starting with usernames as blank username. I wonder if that would mean it was a deleted user? Yeah, if you scroll down, oh, there we go. We start with the agordon username. so they're kind of in chunks there. It just has a few at the top that have a blank username for some reason. I'm not exactly sure why those would be blank. I wonder why. That's so weird. At least it's only five or six there at the top. The rest should all have usernames attached. I think these are the ones that no longer work here. Maybe that's why. Could be. Slack checks. That's probably Slack checks. Okay. Any testing? Oh, let's see. I have it. I have it. All right, so let's see. All right, so with the username gone. It's under the C column. It'll list the usernames. Yeah. So they're already sorted by username currently. So if you hit cancel on that. Yeah. So as you scroll down, you'll see they're all sorted by username. These are the A. Gordon ones. And you can just delete all the rows you do...
