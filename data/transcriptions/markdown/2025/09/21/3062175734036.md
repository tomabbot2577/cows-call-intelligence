## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Dave Hosmer. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you doing? Not too bad. I got a quick question for you, Robin. Okay. On the contracting side, to put a candidate as a contractor. Yes. How do I set them up on that? How does that work? Now, do you mean like, do you, okay, so are you just ending them as a potential contractor or do you mean placing them as a contractor? I'm placing them as a contractor for next week. It's just a project type thing. Okay. So do you have the position in the database that you're placing them on? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Okay. So when you go to make the placement, there's two options. There's the perm option and then there's the contract option. Are you in the pipeline? Like where are you right now? I'm not in the pipeline. I'm in the candidates information. I can go to the pipeline if you want. Okay. So, yeah, you would go to the pipeline. You've got to start from the position. Okay. Okay. And then, actually, do you have legacy or new pipeline? Thought I had the new one. I'm not sure, Robin. Okay. So if you have the new, you have your place option at the end of your pipeline? Yeah, I have placements, yeah. Okay. Drag the candidate over to that panel, I guess we'll want to call it, and you'll be prompted, is it a permanent or a contract? You're right. I put contract. Okay. So a little bit of differences with the contract. One is you still have like the placement date and the start date, but you'll have an end date, which controls like how long and when they're on assignment for. The other thing is. One week project. Okay, gotcha. Yeah. So you just put it like begin date, end date. And when you save the placement, we don't actually move them into that company. But you would see on the start date, like at the end of the day, what we do is the status on their name record will automatically switch from contract temp to on assignment. And then on the end date, they go back to being an available contractor. The other thing, too, is you're going to typically do more like the hourly pay rates and bill rates rather than, you know, perm fee and annual salary. Yeah. Okay, I think I already got that in there. Okay, I appreciate it. Yeah, that's fine either, Robin. Cool. I knew the simple, I hadn't done it for so long. I just wanted to make sure I had it. Yeah, especially with a new pipeline. It's nice because you just drop it over and pick which one, and then it brings out that screen. Perfect. All right, thanks, Robin. All righty. Have a great weekend. You too. Thank you, babe. All righty, thanks. Bye....
