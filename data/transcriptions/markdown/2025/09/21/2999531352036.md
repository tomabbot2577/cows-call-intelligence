## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Seekers Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Conrad calling. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, good. So I had a quick question. I set up something, and I had this before, in the contact information under custom fields. Okay. I set up just a category called pending, and it's just like a yes or no question under custom fields. And so I wanted to show up, though, on my homepage on custom stats. Oh, custom stats on the MyPCR dashboard are searches. So you would have to build a search around that field, and then it will show you how many search results you have. So what specifically are you trying to see related to that field? Just how many do I have pending, just the number. Like, let's just call it like pending candidates. So with a value of yes, then, I guess that would make most sense. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Whatever. or have you asked whether it's three or five, you know, and then I can click on it and see a list of them, right? Oh, perfect. Yeah, I can help you with that. So go to Name in the main menu up at the top of PCR, and then Advanced to open up an advanced search. Okay, Advanced, yep. All right, and then in the first drop-down under Search Params, it says Predefined Fields. Switch that to Custom Fields. Okay. And then to the right of that, choose the custom field. Pending. Okay, so pending. Yep. And then like is fine as the relationship drop down. You can leave that. And then in the value, just type in whatever value you're looking for. The yes, probably. Okay, so yes. Okay. And then click add to the right of that. Yep. Okay. And then scroll down to the bottom. There's going to be a heading called query. And below that, it'll be a generated query. And you want to copy that full code under generated query. Okay. Yep. So I got that. Copy it. All right. And then go to my PCR in the main menu at the top left. Okay. Should I save this first? No, it's fine. like you'll be fine okay so go to my PCR yep and then in the bottom frame in the action menu top right click the customize gear icon okay and if you don't see it it might be you have to click the three line yeah okay and that So wait, wait, hold on one second. So I kind of got distracted here for a second. So I copied the query. So now I should go to my PCR at the top left in the main menu. Okay. And then in the bottom frame, that will show you your my PCR dashboard. At the top right of that is your action menu where you'll have a customized gear icon. If you don't see it, just click the three horizontal lines. That'll open up a pop-up window. Perfect. And then on the left, go to search links. Yep. And then scroll down to an empty search link and paste that code you copied into where it says advanced search, one of those larger text boxes. To the left of that, type in whatever you want to name it under link description. Okay. Yeah, like that. And then to the right of the code you pasted, it'll say search type. Just make sure that that is set to name. It's a name search we did rather than position or company. Okay. Yep, got it. Then hit save at the bottom right. So the greater than doesn't matter. Just skip over that. Yeah, you could skip over that. And you should be in good shape. Next time you click on my PCR, it'll refresh the dashboard and it should include your new added. Okay. Yep, I see it there. There's a bunch already. so I guess those are old. All right, yeah, I think that'll do it. Awesome. Anything else you've been having trouble with? No, I think that's it. That's it for now. Okay, awesome. Well, reach out if you need anything else. All right, thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks. Thanks....
