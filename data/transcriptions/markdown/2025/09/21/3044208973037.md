## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon, Jim. Good afternoon, Chris. How are you? I'm well. How's everything going with you? Not too bad. Not too bad. And I think that we're waiting on Jason, I think, as your trainer for PC Recruiter here. He is not quite in yet, but I expect him momentarily. Okay, no worries. I've got to look for the link. I've got to log into it? No, no. Today's just initially kind of an intro call, handoff call to him. He's going to have a few questions to kind of go over your needs and what you want to cover in the system, how you want the training to go, et cetera. And then he'll get the first several sessions on the schedule. So that's how that will work. Are you in training already? I am. I started training on Monday. So this will be my first week. Awesome. I thought you did. Yeah. Yeah. So next week they wanted me to start, I guess, start making phone calls. But I really, I have a whole list of people on a data sheet that I really don't even know what to make heads or tails of. So I was hoping to at least get some direction today on how that might look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we should be able to do that and get a couple of things scheduled. I'm just trying to get into your account here. I think it's Jason's, the trainer. I'm just kind of checking the record to make sure. Yeah, it was. That's who we were emailing back and forth to. Okay, perfect, yeah. I'm trying to find the original. It looks like there's a unique link that you need to get into it, from what I remember. And I'm trying to find the email with that link on it. That would have probably come from McKenzie. let's get Mackenzie Scalise is his name and that would be your unique URL and admin username and password or in that email as well I might even have it in here because I was cc'd Here, McKenzie, I found. Okay, yeah, I found it. Awesome. Now, is there a way you can set this up on the desktop so that it's pre-set up, or do you have to just go into this login URL every time? you can see some people save it as a favorite so they'll save it as a favorite on their desktop or save it as a favorite in their browser i leave i use pc recruiter i leave my browser open all the time with it there and i i have my time out set to a stupidly obscene highly amount of minutes so it never times out so i just go right to it so i keep a browser open tab open right into it so you can certainly have no problem okay so yeah i'm in i'm in the site now I just don't they said they they exported the data over to it but I don't know how that how to access that it should be in there and it should be something even if you just go to name leave everything blank and hit the search there's a little magnifying glass button in the upper right hand corner if you hit that search that should just do a blank search and it should pull up all the data there. Okay yeah it came up. It looks like it's multiple pages. Yeah you know and it might also be already on a roll-up list so probably I would imagine they have it there. I just popped Jason a quick chat to see what was going on with him there. Yeah, no worries. Yeah, but that data's in there. Like I said, they likely pulled it in on a roll-up list, so it's probably under a roll-up list. so all the data will be under there as well. And that's a nice way of looking at it. You can page through it. You can see all the data right from there. So that gives you some different options there as well. Okay, yeah, if I click on Roll Ups, I see Account Managers. I see Ops Managers. I guess Regional Sales Managers. Sales Engineers. Warehouse Automation Sales. Okay. Jason just said he's wrapping up his last session. as I thought he would he'll be there in just a minute so we'll give him a minute to get in but yeah so they imported a roll-up list so anytime you need to go to any of that data you can go right to that roll-up list clicking on the individual name will open up the record in the bottom frame I believe with dimensional search they even give you a specific format so your screens going to be formatted everything will be set up like that so that'll be good and then Jason's going to go through with some of the nuances of setting up your username and setting up various different things in the system, train you how to utilize the system, train you how to work through if you want to send mass emails or sequences or anything like that. You can do all of that in there as well. Yeah, that would be good. I definitely want to be able to set it up on the automation because I don't want to send an email to every person. If I can do what you call, I guess, a roll-up list where you select what people you're looking for. Is that how the roll-up works? Yep. Yeah, you can go to roll-up list, and when you have that list, you can apply what we call a sequence to that specific list. So essentially, as soon ...
