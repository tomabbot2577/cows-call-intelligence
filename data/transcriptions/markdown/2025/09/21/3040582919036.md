Well, I think Caitlin had called you and, and tried to use the Zeni to turn the bell. Yes. Yeah. You were out of the office. Yeah. You're on to the office. Okay. It's probably best I do a screen share with you. Do you happen to have RingCentral? Yeah, RingCentral. Oh, perfect. Okay. I don't know if I need to take a break. I also have Teams, if you want. I don't have – I don't really use Teams. So let's try RingCentral. And I don't really use RingCentral. I have it. I'm sure I can figure out how to get this done. Let's see here. Okay. So let me set up a meeting for you. here so if you open up your app yeah and go to video and select join The installation package cannot be opened. Verify that the package exists and that you can access or contact the application vendor. All right. Let's see. Well, hold on. Let's get rid of that. Let's see if it works better now. Oh, it's that my threat locker is, let's stop it now. Hold on, let me get IT on the phone with us, and I'll just give him the... I could do it other ways. How about Google Meet? That one's easy.

Looks like it's doing it. Allow camera and microphone. Use microphone and camera. Actually, we don't need those for this. We're going to be, well, actually, we're going to have to, sometimes you get prompt for screen recording, which really means sharing your screen. I'll do whatever you want me to do. It says, ready to join, ask to join. Okay. All right. I'm just going to join my meeting. That must be you. Admit. Okay. All right. All right. So you're – oops. I'm going to join without audio. Go ahead and mute your microphone. Do you want to mute the mic or just hang up on you? Either way, on the meeting. We're already on the phone. Otherwise, it echoes. All right. yeah I needed the computer which is I think what you wanted me to do yeah that's fine okay so let me refresh my memory your ticket was let me find it here's what's going on when I get those yeah when I get emails from customers or send emails to customers I want them to be logged in PCR yeah and for a while they were and now all of a sudden they're not yeah I think if I remember right when I looked at it you would have to re-authenticate it could be that security's changed since you originally set it up or even your password changed so here's I'm going to have you do at the bottom of your meeting screen if you can click share screen it's the rectangle with the arrow Okay, and then go over to where it says entire screen. That will be at the right. So keep in mind I have three screens. Okay. So when you go over to entire screen in that pop-up, it's going to show you a preview of each of those three screens. Click on the one that you want to share. and then hit share. Okay. All right. So I'm going to have you, I see your Outlook. Let's have you open a PC Recruiter. Actually, I wonder if you were doing this, or there's a couple things possibly going on. Okay. So the one I would do is for PCR mail, and then we'll come over and look at your Outlook too. So let's have you on this window. Let's have you go to PC Recruiter. Get you fixed up in both places, it looks like. Okay. And if you need, you can see it over there so you can see it, I guess. Oh, it looks like you left the meeting. You might have closed the meeting window. I did. Hold on. That was ridiculous. Can you hear me still? Yes. All right. All right. Yeah, I guess I just tried to open PCR while I was in the meeting, and it closed you. I'm sorry. That's okay. Yeah, you got to keep that browser tab open. Yeah, I'm going to go back in it. So hold on. And then when it prompts you about joining with computer audio, just say no to that. So this thing right here, you're not in the meeting, so you can't see what I'm doing. Why is that screen not open? All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Okay. All right.
