## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. My name is Steve Kuhn. How are you? Good. How are you today? I'm fine. Thank you. I received an email from Garrett Camiotti, and I was going to try to reach him, but perhaps you can help me. I'm actually trying to close out my account. I'm retiring from the recruiting space, and my account has been on hold since March of this year. And I want to go ahead and pull the trigger on this and just go ahead and close it out, if that's possible. Can you help me with that? So you would need to contact your account representative, Jim Lombardo. Jim Lombardo, okay. So what I can do is let me see if he's available here real quick. All right. Thank you. Looks like he is on the other line. What I could do is transfer you to his voicemail. All right. And then he would be able to put in that cancellation for you. Okay. And help you with any of the other stuff that you would need. Okay. So he's my guy. He's my account guy? Yep. Okay. My account guy was Jim Wise. I guess he's no longer with the company. Is that right? Yeah. He retired. He retired. Good for him. Okay. Can I leave a message with Jim in his voicemail? Yep. Yeah, I'll transfer you over to his voicemail. Great. Okay, thank you. Yep, transferring you over there in three, two, one. Thank you....
