**[0:06] Speaker_00:** Sorry so much.

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I had us down for 1.30, but I checked the email, and it's for 1 o'clock.

**[0:13] Speaker_00:** I just messed it up, man.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** Let me see if I can get Robin on the phone, see if she's still available.

**[0:17] Speaker_01:** I got just a quick check.

**[0:19] Speaker_01:** All righty.

**[0:20] Speaker_01:** I'm going to try and cop this.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** Okay, here we go.

**[2:37] Speaker_01:** Yes.

**[2:38] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** I was going to say, do you have that Zoom that we could jump right back in?

**[2:42] Speaker_01:** Because Robin just chatted me and said she could jump back into the Zoom.

**[2:47] Speaker_01:** If you have it, might be able to start it right now.

**[2:53] Speaker_00:** You may have.

**[2:55] Speaker_00:** You know, I checked my email about 45 minutes ago, and I didn't hear anything since our last exchange of emails.

**[3:04] Speaker_00:** I'm not sure if that was looking for a Zoom link.

**[3:08] Speaker_01:** I will send it over.

**[3:11] Speaker_01:** I'll resend the invite to you right now.

**[3:14] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:20] Speaker_01:** Okay, I just sent it right over.

**[3:25] Speaker_01:** So that'll kick it up.

**[3:27] Speaker_01:** It's going to be there.

**[3:28] Speaker_01:** And let me hang up with you.

**[3:30] Speaker_00:** If you would, I'll dial right into that as well.

**[3:32] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:33] Speaker_01:** Sounds good.
