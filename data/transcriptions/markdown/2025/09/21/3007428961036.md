## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. This is John Lippman over at Genesis, and I've got a pretty easy and quick question. So how are you doing today? Good. How are you? Doing well, thanks. I've got a roll-up list with 49 people on it, and after reviewing it, I have to remove 19 of the 40. So I selected those 19 files by putting a check in the select box on the left-hand side. And I've come across the top where those three lines are, obtained the drop-on, and I was trying to either select move to roll-up or even copy to roll-up. And then I could delete them, but neither seems to be working. Yeah, let me pop in and take a look here. Which database are you in? Consumer. Ben, what's your username for PCR? JXL. so it's just like nothing happening when you click on that move to roll up yeah exactly okay so first thing we're going to try to do is just clear your browser cache do you have those 19 names like you know them off the top of your head which i've got them uh the stage is marked so no worry if i close out or do anything okay Perfect. So in the top, are you using Chrome as your browser? Yes, I am. Okay. So what you're going to do in the very top right of Chrome, you're going to see those three vertical dots. Yes. You're going to click on those and you're going to go down to where it says delete browsing data. new tab new window passwords history downloads bookmarks should be about halfway done yep okay right and that's going to open up a new tab yep you're going to go over to where it says advanced. In the time range you're going to select all time. Okay. And then the only box that you want to have checked down at the bottom there is the one that says cached images and files. Everything else you want to uncheck. Okay everything is unchecked except cast images and files so go ahead and hit delete data yep done and then once that does its thing and it's just goes to that regular settings tab go back to pc recruiter and refresh the page which will log you out and then you'll log back in Logging in. Logging in. Now logging in. And then once you're logged in, go ahead and try and move those people from the roll-up. again there. Yep. 12 of 19. Okay. What I'm trying to do is move to roll up and I got to create a new roll up. So I can do both of those at the same time, right? Yep. Yeah. When you do the move to roll up option, you'll see that add roll up at the bottom right of that box that pops up. Bad roll up, yep. I wish you allowed a little bit more letters in the naming. Me too. But that's kind of why they put that description in there. So you can kind of put a short name and then the description. Give you a little bit more room there if you need it. Save. Okay, nothing's happening today. Now that I created the roll-up, do I need to click on the zero in it in order to... Yep, exactly. Perfect. Close. And it is perfect. Thank you. Yep, not a problem. Give yourself a fine day. You as well. If you need anything else, just let us know. Always. Thank you. Yep. Bye. Bye....
