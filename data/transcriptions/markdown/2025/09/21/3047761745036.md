## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Nancy Schaefer. Hey, I just noticed. Hey, how are you? I'm good. Good. Hey, I just wanted to let you guys know that PCR has just been really dragging today. We're going really slow. Okay. Sometimes it speeds up and sometimes the pages don't all download quickly. this has been kind of going on and off for probably about a week and a half, but today I'm getting frustrated by it. And I checked to make sure it wasn't my internet. Okay. Now, sometimes what can happen, it's not necessarily with things that you notice on another site, but maybe there is like a network disruption. Have you, let me see, because we do a little bit more for security than some others where, you know we'll log you out and stuff like that any chance you have um restarted your computer i did you did okay what about restarting your network connection maybe and you're at the terrace group right correct okay like are you working from home or anything i am Sometimes you gotta reboot that router. Let me see if I can. And are you using Chrome or Edge? Chrome. Okay. I'm just going to compare to see what's going on here. Okay, database loaded up. Do you go in default or Keras group? Keras group. Okay. And what username do you go in as? I don't need the password. Admin. Admin, okay. Admin. Any certain areas where you notice, I'm going to go in and see what I can do? No, the whole thing. It's just in flow. Yeah. Like I said, I called a Comcast because I thought, well, maybe there's focus for, it seemed even like my LinkedIn was a little slow, but then that got really quick, and this is still lagging. And like I said, I just had, like I clicked on, I had a candidate's name up, and then I added something into notes, but then the little area that has the candidate's name, you know, the edit name, resume, interviews, activities, you know, that little border wasn't coming up. So I'm kind of popping around between a few names here, like Mike Big, Chris Melvin, and I'm bouncing around pretty quickly. I'm going to have you try a couple things. Do you use Chrome or Edge? Chrome. Okay. At the top right of Chrome, go up to Help. Oh, yeah. The three vertical dots. Go to Help and go to About Google Chrome. Let's just see if, like, pushing an update to Chrome has any difference. Then we'll try clearing cache. Yeah, in Chrome, if you go to those three vertical dots, click on that and then go down to help. Okay. Okay. And what that'll do is, yeah. And what that'll do is, you know, check to make sure that your Chrome is the most recent version. Yeah, and it's updating right now. Because it seems to be. And you know what else I realize I haven't done, which I should, is I haven't cleared out my cookies. Yeah, the cookies aren't usually a problem. it's usually the cached images and files, which I was going to have you try next. Let me try a couple things. Okay. Okay. Nearly up to date. I have to relaunch it. Okay. No, it seems to be moving a lot quicker. Okay, and I know what to do. That could be one thing. The other thing I would try is go to those three vertical dots again. Go to delete browsing data. Let me know when you're there. Yeah. Go to where it says time range. Make sure that says all time. And then only check cached images and files. Okay. So uncheck cookies and other site and browsing history. Yeah, yeah, only check cached images and files. And then, so it should say all time cached images and files and then delete data. Okay. All right, that is done. Okay, then I'd like fully exit PCR Chrome and then try going back in and let's see if that helps. Okay. Well, the loading page is a little slow. Now, that'll be because we just deleted cache. That almost always happens the first time. One of the things about cache is it tries to remember things about a page so that they load faster. But sometimes it's got to clear it out because if things change, then it's getting a little confused. So the first time it might be a little bit slower, but then after that it might be faster. Okay. Everything seems quick right now. So I'll just, if I see it slows down again, I'll call you back. Okay. Yeah, hopefully that'll do it, though. All right, Robin. Thanks so much. You are welcome. Have a good week. Thanks. You too. Be safe. Bye-bye....
