## 💬 Full Transcript

 Yo. Hey, sorry. I just had my coughing fit. Oh, all good, homie. I just sent you a message in the ticket, too, where Ed let us 2FA into his account for me. Oh, oh. Jake's going to need 2FA'd in as well. Okay. So if you could just reach out so we can get on a call with him again. Get Jake in there. Shoot me a message if he responds. Alright, that sounds good. What's your schedule look like tomorrow? Tomorrow I've got 10 a.m. training, 2.30 training, and then a half hour meeting at 11.30. Let's see if we can get on with him at 9 again, first thing in the morning. Okay, cool. That works perfect. Yeah, I'll suggest that. All right. Yeah, I'll let you know the agency response. All right, sounds good. Thank you. Bye....
