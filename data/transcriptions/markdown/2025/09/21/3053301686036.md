## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Yes, sir. I do IT for aviation personnel, and I'm trying to get the PCR portal to work with the new Outlook, Office 365. So it is only available on the classic Outlook. The new Outlook doesn't support the add-ins, which is the PCR portal. Oh, it's the classic Outlook? Yeah, I meant new as in not like 2019 or 2016. Yeah, I definitely got the classic Outlook on there. I just can't get the portal to – it's a fresh install, and I just can't get it to pop off when I open Outlook. Okay. Did you add it as an administrator? It did ask for administrator permission when I went to install it. Gotcha. So you might just have to add it manually. and I can walk you through those steps real quick. Okay, let's do it. So you're going to go to File, inside of Outlook, and then Options. Yep. And that will open that, like, general options box. Yeah, go to Add-ins. Yep.
