## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Bob. Quick question. If I moved a bunch of names from one roll-up list to another roll-up list, and that new roll-up list had a sequence that you and I did last week, will it automatically send out those new names that I transferred to that roll-up list? yeah if it's currently unpaused the sequence it'll start everybody at that first step and start them through it right which was the second step which was the second email okay because i screwed myself how i set it up but i think i'm okay so what you're saying is if i took let's say 150 names from roll up a and i added them to roll up b which is the sequence list roll up then I just have to make sure as long as it's not paused, that roll-up list, it'll add those new names and send out that first email on the sequence. Yep, exactly. That's what I needed to just confirm. Okay, so I just have to look to make sure the sequence isn't paused. Okay, perfect. All right, thank you so much. No problem. Have a good one. Bye-bye. You too. Bye....
