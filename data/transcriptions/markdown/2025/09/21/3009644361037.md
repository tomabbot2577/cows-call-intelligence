## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. I'm going to go ahead and start the recording. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Sorry, my assistant had also put it on my calendar, and for some reason it popped up as a Teams link, and so I was like, do, do, do, do. And I was like, wait a second, he's a Teams link. No problem. No problem, no problem. So, yeah, so I wanted just to talk with you a little bit about your account. I think we needed to initially get a new signer because the old signer Marsha is no longer there. And we were going to maybe talk about the premium package of PC recruiters since we're doing a new contract anyway. So it might be worth taking a look at that if that would be of interest to you, or do you have any thoughts on that? I don't know that we even use ours fully. We kind of, we need to use it more. We almost use it as like a glorified Rolodex. because I don't know exactly what features are included and what are not. And so that would be good just to go over that all in general. Yeah, yeah. We'll talk about kind of what you're looking at. So you're looking, you are using a pretty basic package of PC Recruiter. You're using the Enterprise, which is essentially just the Outlook integration. Do you post the jobs on your website right now, or don't you use that piece? We post them on our website because I don't know if we have that, It's like it's that capability. I tried to find out and could never seem to find out. Okay. Well, you have an older version. You have an older version called the Web Extensions. There is a newer job board, which is more customizable, which is part of the upgrade, if that was something you were looking to do, that we could post the jobs. Let's see. So it looks like there are some jobs on your site right now, but it doesn't look like they're through PC Recruiter. No, they are not. They are just simply through our website. Okay. Okay. So we have a job board piece that would be that. Do you have the ability to do that now, or is that only with the upgrade? Well, a bit. So you have the web extensions, so you have the older piece of the job board software. So if you wanted to do nothing else but just add the job board, it would be 250 set up, no more monthly. It would upgrade to the job board. So 250 one time would upgrade to the job board because you have an older version now. we really support the new version of the job board 10 is what we have now. So that is part of the upgrade, but even if you didn't want to do the upgrade, it could be part of your existing package. Okay, and the job board, would it automatically, like we would just put the jobs in MP3 Recruiter and they would go up, I guess, on our website or? Yeah, yeah, let me show you. I'm going to share my screen just to kind of show you that, and then I'll show you some other stuff too. Okay, let me share my window here. Okay, perfect. So yeah, so what happens with the PC Recruiter job board? If you put a job into PC Recruiter and it's in there, available slash open with one opening or more. So as long as those two criteria are met, this is a little overrider. It'll default to show, but you can always default to do not show if you wanted to first make sure everything was appropriate before you moved it to show. you'll see you have a little online little green thing they're saying it's online so if the job is entered into the system with one opening or more and it's available it'll go on your website automatically so you would actually have the ability to choose from one of these different templates so if you wanted your jobs listed like this or maybe you wanted a little more information on the screen maybe you wanted it to look like a table so we have a few different options that you can choose from that it'll post the jobs on your site and then the candidates are able to look at so let's go into one they can look at any one of the positions they're going to see the detail directly pulled from PC recruiter formatted description any fields you choose to show and then that's automatic so as soon as the job will be filled it would be taken down off of your site and they're going to be able to go down to the bottom and they can apply so if they hit apply this can be skipped or enabled this will let them sign in using LinkedIn or Yahoo or indeed or any of these and what that'll do is it'll, PCRecruiter will check first to make sure they're not already in your database. And if they are, it won't add a doobit, it will merely update their existing record to include today's application. And then you are able to kind of dictate what information you want to require of them. They can upload a resume, fill out other fields, anything you wish. So it's a custom application. What that does is that's going to let them get themselves directly entered into PCRecruiter and into the pipeline for that job. So it's kind of an online...
