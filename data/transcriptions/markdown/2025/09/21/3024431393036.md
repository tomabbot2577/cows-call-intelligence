## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Mean Seeking Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Hey, Jason. This is Kristen Elfman. I work with EHS Recruiting Company, and I use the Outlook portal, and it's not working. It said the extension was no longer supported by Chrome, so I reloaded an extension, but I still can't get it to work, so I'm hoping you can help me. The Outlook portal or the PCR capture tool? I don't know. So the way I do it is I do everything through Outlook, and I split my screen, and I've got PCR on my toolbar, and I don't have it there anymore. Okay. Let's get on a screen share so we can take a look. Yeah. Do you use RingCentral? I can. I don't know what that is. Okay. Go to meetings.ringcentral.com in your browser. Okay. Hold on a second. Meetings. Oh, there we go. RingCentral. Okay. RingCentral. You said meetings.ringcentral.com? Yes. Okay. All right. All right. Is it asking for like a meeting ID? No. Maybe I'm not. RingCentral Cloud Communication. That's not right. All right. Meetings.RingCentral. OpenMeetings.Tech. I'm just Googling it. RingCentral.com. The website should be meetings.ringcentral.com.

Oh, I don't know what that did. C-L-A-S-S-I-C. Am I putting it right? Yeah, you're good. Try Outlook, like clear out classic, and then just type in Outlook. And hit enter? Yeah, I believe that's when we have open, so we might just need to install the portal. Okay, go ahead and go back to your browser. We're going to install the Outlook portal. It looks like it's not on here for some reason. Okay. Actually, I'm sorry. Let's start here. In your Outlook window, go to the top left corner and go to File. Yep.

Okay, go ahead and click on that and hit enable. click on that item okay and then hit close okay and hit okay in the bottom right and we're going to close outlook and reopen it okay well I've got to open make sure that it let me just make sure that it's actually closing sometimes it takes forever the task manager yeah shut it down make sure it's shut down yeah okay okay and you want me to reopen it yep okay Oh, there it looks like it might have worked. Yay. Ah, what happened? Sometimes it can get disabled. It just happens. Okay. Like it can just kind of get knocked offline. If that happens, just call us and we can turn it back on.
