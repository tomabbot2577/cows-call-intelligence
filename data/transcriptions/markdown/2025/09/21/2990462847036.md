**[1:21] Speaker_03:** I work with Brian Lucas, just so you're wondering who I am.

**[1:25] Speaker_03:** My name's Ashley.

**[1:26] Speaker_03:** So I'm going to be working closely with Brian.

**[1:29] Speaker_03:** Awesome.

**[1:30] Speaker_03:** Excellent.

**[1:32] Speaker_03:** Excellent.

**[1:34] Speaker_01:** How are you?

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** Good.

**[1:36] Speaker_02:** How are you?

**[1:37] Speaker_02:** Ashley, you could change your name on the Zoom.

**[1:40] Speaker_02:** Did you have to download Zoom?

**[1:43] Speaker_03:** Yeah.

**[1:43] Speaker_03:** I'm going to have to edit all of this.

**[1:45] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[1:45] Speaker_02:** I just changed my name on it.

**[1:47] Speaker_02:** Okay.

**[1:47] Speaker_02:** Forgive us.

**[1:49] Speaker_02:** This is literally like our first Zoom call at Eisner Amper.

**[1:52] Speaker_02:** Oh, well.

**[1:54] Speaker_01:** No, because we use Teams.

**[1:57] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:58] Speaker_01:** And Garrett, what do you use?

**[1:59] Speaker_01:** I don't think Garrett uses Zoom.

**[2:00] Speaker_00:** Oh, for our trainings, we'll use RingCentral, but you won't need to download it.

**[2:07] Speaker_00:** I can just give you a link for each one when I invite you to our trainings and it'll open up on your browser.

**[2:12] Speaker_02:** OK.

**[2:12] Speaker_02:** All right.

**[2:14] Speaker_02:** Perfect.

**[2:15] Speaker_02:** Excellent.

**[2:16] Speaker_02:** OK.

**[2:18] Speaker_02:** So should we be on video or because you guys aren't?

**[2:21] Speaker_02:** It doesn't matter to me.

**[2:22] Speaker_01:** We don't need to be.
