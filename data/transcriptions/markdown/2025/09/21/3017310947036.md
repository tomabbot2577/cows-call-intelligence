## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello. Hey, Robin. How are you? I'm good. I was calling you about, oh, here it is, Mark Anderson, this guy from Montgomery County. I already fixed his stuff with, like, the tax-exempt stuff, so he doesn't have any balance, but now he's been, like, requesting remove the term and conditions on the quote or send us any. I don't really know what he's referring to. Do you happen to know what he's talking about? I think something about they pay annually. Are they coming up to pay? No, they're not due until January. So I'm kind of like a little confused what they might need edited. No, yeah, I have no idea. So usually what they have to do is they need a new quote every year to get approved to have everything paid for every year. So we send them a quote every year, and maybe they have a quote that is an agreement, but I wouldn't have sent a new agreement. I don't know what he's talking about. I've got to look into it because I know they get a quote every year, and they have to submit a fresh quote to get a fresh year's approval and everything like that. Yeah, I see some estimates. So I think it's just he's got to let us know sometime in December, I guess, right? Yeah, I would say. And I don't think anything needs to – I'll have to look and see what – It doesn't seem like anything's automated for it. I mean, it's not – wait, let me – where am I going? No, they, I think, manually pay it every year. Yeah, but I think even this estimate. let me go back to it. I just had it up and I closed it. Sorry. The only recurring thing is just an invoice. But I do see some history of what's called an estimate that is sent and then I guess an invoice is generated after that. Like all these estimates just have the status of pending. So then it looks like they make an invoice and then they send a check to pay it. I don't think there's anything. I don't know what he's talking about, removing these conditions. I don't even know what he has right now that would even apply because I don't know what he's talking about. I saw that and I was like, I'll look at that later because I have no idea what he's talking about. It's like months away. Bottom of the list. I don't know what that means. yeah because he doesn't have anything open he's paid for the year okay okay can you find out what he might be meaning i don't really know what i will i don't know if it's like agreement or what yeah i'll talk with him they've had an agreement enforced for years i don't think that that's new or different or anything like that yeah so i don't really know what's going on. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye....
