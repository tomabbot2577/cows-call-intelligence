## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling me, sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. Good morning. This is Matt Barkus with Precision Executive Search. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm doing well. Doing well, thanks. Hey, I have a question in regards to the RingCentral app for my PC. Okay. I know I kept getting messages that it was going away, and then I downloaded it. you know, so download the new one, whatever. And then, like, literally I haven't turned off my computer in, like, a week or two. So I just did that and rebooted it. And now I don't have that. Like, I have the app on my phone where it can send and receive text. But I normally, like, if I'm in a record, a candidate record, I can click the text button in their record on my laptop and the box pops up on my screen and I can communicate and type right in that box. Yeah. So does that completely disappear? No. No, it's just probably you need to change one setting so when you're doing the call or the text, it knows the correct app to try to use. Okay. So if you – are you – you're an administrator? Yes. Okay. What database do you log into? You got Civil Engineering, Default, Precision Search, and TMG. Precision Search, yeah. Sorry, Precision Search. Okay. No problem. Okay, so if you go to, it's a real simple change. If you go to system on the main toolbar, go to users. Yep. And then click manage users. Okay. Okay, click on your username. Yep. Okay, so it looks like you might be using admin. so one thing I would do on your user account where it says contact phone there what you're going to want to do is put in your direct ring central number wait where is that it's not okay under contact information yeah one thing you'll want to do is put that there and the reason is like if you're ever doing like trying to get somebody to opt in to receiving text it'll pull the number from there 4942 okay yeah just make sure it's that direct primary number for you okay then save that and then next to that field what you're going to want to do is click on the gear icon for phone settings okay now that I cut the drop-down is kind of like cut off but what you're going to want to do where it says user phone configuration you want to make sure that says ring central app which actually it does okay wait hold on one second yeah so that should be there all in one yeah that should be there all in one okay so it does say that okay um did you change that after from going from the old app to the new i haven't changed i haven't been anything in the system like i what i was using was the rings that i think probably the was i don't know the ring central desktop phone maybe Yeah, the old one where it was just the singular phone. Okay. So it looks like you have since then changed that. So hold on. What else could be going on here? Because, like, when I click on, I have an icon that says Ring Central Phone on my laptop, and it, you know, it pulls it up, and then it says. Does it say Ring Central App? No, it says Ring Central Phone. No, I do have the main pencil. Okay. Yeah. Okay. You know what? Let's do a screen share. I just want to make sure. Because you want to make sure you have the one that's, like, installed. And that's the one that's going to try to use. Yeah. Let me do. Hold on. I'm going to try to text my daughter back. Okay. Okay. No worries. I need to talk to her, you know, and try to get a hold of your college kid. They don't want to answer. Oh. I know.
