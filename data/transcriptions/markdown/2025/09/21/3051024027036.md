## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, this is Bill. Hey, Bill. It's Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. How are you? Hey, Robin. How are you? I'm good. I have a question. I got your voicemail. Are you getting that error when you are going in through the Outlook portal or from your browser? No, I'm getting it when I click on – I just opened up the browser in Chrome. Okay. And then I have a bunch of things already bookmarked, and normally I just click on the PC Recruiter. That sounds like the link is not right. Yeah. What it's saying here is http://www2.pcrecruiter.net.pcr.asp?uid equals, you know, the whole thing. O-D-B-C William J. Haig? Yes, it's unreachable. Is there a space or something at the end? A space at the end of that? Yeah. What do you mean a space? I'm going to send you the link. I'm getting to your page without any issue. Okay. Well, how am I going to get there unless I go through Outlook? Let me see if it's in Outlook. That would be the only way I could open something now. Because I would say if it's happening in Outlook, it could be that you have an older version of the portal add-in that just needs to be updated. But if it's happening in Chrome, that sounds like something different. So something's off with the link. Okay. I just PC. Oh, here we go. Okay. So I got an email from you. PC Recruiter Support. Yeah. Click on that link. What was it? That's supposed to be your link, and it opens for me. bear with me I'm taking a while to load the link I get okay here we go I just have slow internet just we have these like power surges lately with the heat and and everybody's just running their network issue okay here's the hi bill here's the link So you want me to click on the link, the first thing you sent me, right? Under high bill? Yeah. Which is basically what I read back to you. Yeah, the other one's like a ticket link. still no luck no that guy's just slow yeah same thing this site can't be reached okay something's timing out then do you have ring central I don't think so so let me send you let me do a meeting I mean if I was away for four days I wonder if there's something hung up in the back end for an instant meeting. Okay, let's see. I thought, well, I know my account's good because we took care of that last week. Yeah, yeah, that's not it at all. Not the issue at all. I just got your second email here. Dismiss. No. Okay, that's good. So you're going to Google. Yeah, the Google me, like join the call or whatever. now when you join don't join with audio since we're on the phone or at least mute it unless you're in otherwise it gives you a lot of background let's say if there's two boxes it'll open up here so I just want to I just want to hit the join call button here right alright let's see what happens I don't I didn't touch audio so Ready to join? Ask to join. All right. Keep the microphone off. Do you need the camera? You don't need a camera on either of those. No, you don't need either one of those because we're going to share a screen. Okay. Ask to be let in. Okay. Alert me any moment. Hmm. It's not even alerting me yet. Spinning. Have you restarted your computer and or your router, like modem stuff? The router, yes, because, again, we had some power surges. And the reason I know that is because I lost the Internet on my television. Okay. That took a little while. Have you restarted your computer? I wonder if that's – maybe try restarting your computer. Try that because it could be like there's like a network connection in the back end, and maybe your computer is still kind of hung up there. Because especially with our security is how we log you out for an activity and force new login. Right. That could be an issue. Okay. You can't really the same as going to some other sites? You left the meeting. So I got out of the meeting. You want me to just restart, right? Yeah, restart your computer. Because that way, if there's something like hung up in the network in your computer, that should reset it. I checked the Internet. It said it was connected. but that doesn't necessarily mean that's the only thing, right? Yeah. All right. Now it says Chrome is not responding, so I can't even get out of this right now. Let me do this. It wasn't even showing like you're trying to get into the meeting yet. Oh, is that right? Okay, I went back to that screen. How about I, so I don't hold you up, why don't I close out everything, restart computer, give it a minute to do its thing and try it again if that's not working. At least I'll get back to you, but I think we'll do that. That might be the simple fix. Okay, sounds good. Okay, I appreciate it. Thanks for the quick call. All right, bye-bye. Bye. Thank you....
