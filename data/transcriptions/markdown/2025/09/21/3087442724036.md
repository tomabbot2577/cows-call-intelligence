## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hello, JP. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good. How are you? I am well. Just call in to check in and see if you're adding the sequencing to PC Recruiter or not. The invoice went out a couple of weeks ago, and I just wanted to circle back. Yeah, can you hear me okay? Yeah. Sorry, I just switched you over to my earbuds. So, yeah, I'm most likely going to be going through with it. I've been – we've had a lot going on and dealing with source whale stuff and, you know, trying to get some things figured out with those guys. And it looks like temporarily I'm going to have to halt using source whale because they found that there's something broken with how it communicates with PC recruiter. So they have to basically redesign the entire program to work with it. So I'm most likely going to have to figure out something, and I'm thinking that the sequencing is most likely going to be the best option to try and try to use in the meantime. For sure, for sure. Okay, well, then I will wait to just whenever you pay that invoice, we can get the ticket in to get the install going. I'll wait to see that come through. And if you have any questions or anything or need anything more, just let me know. Yeah, I'll most likely be doing that this morning because I need to talk to – I actually have a call scheduled with them at 11 to figure out what we're doing on their front. So I'll most likely be taking care of that this morning. Very well, very well. Anything I can do, let me know. I'll be on the lookout. I do have a question for you. Your timing is rather impeccable. Um, we're also in the process of, um, evaluating, we've been using Zoom Info for the past three or four years, and we're in the process of evaluating that contract and looking at other competitors. I assume you know what Zoom Info is? Yeah. Do you guys have any other – do you guys have any integrations that work with ZoomInfo or with like ZoomInfo competitors that you guys also have integrations with? Yeah. The other one we work with is called HireEasy. I think they're a little bit cheaper than ZoomInfo, and they do a very similar thing. So they have like contact information for people. And it works the same way like you can click a little button in the menu of the name record, and you can enrich the information right from there. It doesn't have like – if you go to the advanced search, it doesn't have that search like the ZoomInfo does, but it will enrich one at a time out of the name record. Zoom info doesn't really work well with PCR anyway. Like, you have to pay for Appy credits for it to work the right way. You have to be on, like, an enterprise edition, which it's, like, it ends up adding, like, another, like, 10 grand a year to be able to use it. So, like, it actually, the button in mine doesn't work the way that it does, the way that it's supposed to. Okay. So, like, that's one thing that it took us, like, four months, five months to figure out how to get it to work. And finally, like, within one of the phone calls that I was on with Zoom Info, they were like, well, yeah, you have to have the API credits for it to work. I was like, well, that's a new one. Nobody ever told us that. And that's when your word was filled with you guys. and Matt and I figured out also that that was part of the reason that that button wasn't working for us. And for each of those credits, it's like 50 cents a credit basically. So if you check like 100 people a day, it costs you 50 bucks to enrich people through that. It's real expensive. I'm told the Hiree Z is much more cost effective. So that's something there, but that's the other one we interface with that does that. Okay. Yeah, I'll have to look into them. I always assumed that HireEasy was just like a job board or something like that. Yeah, no, they are data enrichment. They used to be called HireTool is what they started in life as. HireEasy. I will look them up too. Cool. Well, I certainly appreciate that. And like I said, I'll most likely be getting that getting that taken care of today. Well, I will be on the lookout and get it processed as soon as it comes in. Get you started. All right. Sounds good. All right. Thank you. All right. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye now. Thank you....
