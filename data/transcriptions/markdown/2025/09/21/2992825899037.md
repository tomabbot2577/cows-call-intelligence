## 📝 Summary

It seems like the conversation was about using Cerise's system to create and send candidate presentations. Here are some key points that were discussed:

*   The system allows users to create a presentation template with a resume and highlights section.
*   Users can select a default letter or type in their own message when sending the presentation.
*   The system provides tracking and feedback features, allowing users to see who has viewed the presentation and what feedback has been received.
*   Users can also add additional information to the presentation, such as an intro text or a subject line.
*   The system allows users to select which email address to use when sending the presentation, giving them more flexibility.

Overall, it seems like Cerise's system is designed to make it easy for users to create and send candidate presentations while also providing useful tracking and feedback features.

## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:00] Speaker_04:** Please hold while I try to connect you.

**[0:06] Speaker_04:** Good afternoon.

**[0:08] Speaker_03:** This is Mark.

**[0:11] Speaker_00:** Hi, it's Robin.

**[0:12] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:13] Speaker_03:** Hey, lady.

**[0:15] Speaker_03:** Your ears ringing?

**[0:17] Speaker_00:** I don't know.

**[0:20] Speaker_00:** I'm all over the place today, I feel like.

**[0:23] Speaker_03:** I literally just called and left a message for the general mailbox.

**[0:28] Speaker_03:** I thought you were them calling back.

**[0:31] Speaker_03:** I know you're busy.

**[0:33] Speaker_03:** I know you've got a lot going on.

**[0:34] Speaker_03:** So I should have asked you yesterday when I had you on the call.

**[0:38] Speaker_03:** But do you have two seconds?

**[0:41] Speaker_03:** Basically just two minutes?

**[0:44] Speaker_00:** Wait.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Hold on.

**[0:46] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** Yeah, what's up?

**[0:53] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:54] Speaker_03:** Okay.

**[0:54] Speaker_03:** So, when I'm in a name record, right, it kind of ties into what we were talking about yesterday of some of the challenges we had with SmartSearch, is that a lot of our candidates are our customers, right?

**[1:09] Speaker_03:** And so, if I go into a name record and I want to send a resume, right, and I pull a resume up and I go to email that resume, right?

**[1:23] Speaker_03:** When I go to the to field and I want to find somebody and I search for them, if I look up Sam Smith and Sam Smith is my customer who I need to send this resume to, the email that comes up is the default primary, right?

**[1:46] Speaker_03:** And that has been their personal emails.

**[1:51] Speaker_03:** is there a way to select another field to look at that or am I going to have to do a global change to change everything?

**[2:04] Speaker_04:** One second.

**[2:05] Speaker_04:** I think it will.

**[2:08] Speaker_04:** Let me close up until I'm here.

**[2:18] Speaker_00:** so we because pcr doesn't really do like that primary email field is really like primary it's like usually going to be a personal email if it's a candidate a working email if it's going to be a client it's meant to really just be their primary um but that's the thing like if if if the client is both a candidate and a customer of ours.

**[2:42] Speaker_00:** Yeah.

**[2:42] Speaker_03:** Is there a way to select that email without copy-pasting?

**[2:46] Speaker_00:** I don't think so, but let me find out.

**[2:49] Speaker_00:** Let me do a little test here.

**[2:52] Speaker_00:** I want to take, what do I have on mine?

**[2:59] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:18] Speaker_00:** So you're in the resume tab, you go to email, right?

**[3:22] Speaker_03:** Correct.

**[3:23] Speaker_03:** So I get the compose email field up.

**[3:25] Speaker_03:** You get the, to the right, search.

**[3:30] Speaker_03:** So I click on the email field in the two, and then the address book comes up.

**[3:35] Speaker_00:** I hit search and I go okay and send it to you know more at mark yeah it doesn't look in the custom field because all of those extra email fields they're all considered custom fields it does not appear to return any of those just what's in the primary so you would have to copy paste a different field there's no way to create like a drop-down at that point not currently Now, Presentations, I think, does it that way.

**[4:14] Speaker_03:** How do I do, what's Presentations?

**[4:17] Speaker_00:** Let me see.

**[4:18] Speaker_00:** Let me make sure on that first before I even encourage you to do anything like that.

**[4:24] Speaker_00:** Presentations is kind of cool because you actually get tracking.

**[4:29] Speaker_00:** Instead of just sending them an email that happens to have a resume attached, you're actually sending them a link and you can set that link to expire, which can prevent some backdoor hires on you.

**[4:41] Speaker_00:** You can also control can they download the file and you're basically just giving like a link to view candidates.

**[4:47] Speaker_00:** And I believe that one.
