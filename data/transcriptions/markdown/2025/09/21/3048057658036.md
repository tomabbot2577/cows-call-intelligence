## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. Happy to help you. Hey, Tyler. This is Adam Consiglio. How are you? Hey, how's it going, Adam? Good. I know you guys have showed me how to do this before, but I really don't want to screw it up. Yeah. So I have two roll-ups, and I'm trying to make a list of the people that are not on the smaller roll-ups. So what I did is I have the master roll-up, and then I selected a bunch of names out of that, created another roll-up, and I just need to make sure I collected all the titles from the one. And I know we've done this before, so I just can't. Yeah, not a problem. So what you can do is you'll go to screen. Should we do a screen share or no? We can if you want, if that makes it easier for you. It made it a lot easier for me. Yeah, not a problem. Let me start up a meeting here. I'll email you over the link real quick. Just get you pulled up. And then which email works best for you? CM Search Group. adoc and siglio at CM Search Group. Perfect. All right. Just sent that on over to you. You should get it here in just a second. Then did it come over there for you yet? Yeah, let me refresh. Oh. Why don't I see you in my deleted box? How did that happen? I sometimes wonder if I get emails that automatically go into the deleted email box. I mean, have you heard of that happening? Because it seems to be happening a lot lately that I've gotten an email, and I don't remember looking at it, but it's in my deleted mail. Maybe you have a mail rule set up somehow? I don't know how that would have happened. Anyway, okay, I'm here at the meeting thing. I'm hitting admit now. Do I have to hit join by using your browser? No, you'll pop in in a second. All right. And then you should see us both in that meeting. Are you seeing the TT and the AC? I'm not seeing them. Hold on just a minute. Or you might have, like, a minimized ringtone. Oh, yeah, here we go. I got it. Okay, I got it. Perfect. I'll share. Which screen? Whichever one has PCR open on it. I got two PCRs open. So I'll start with this one. Okay, so let me show you. So I've got... Okay, so the two roll-ups I'm working with are these two. Okay, and what I want to do is create a third list of people that are on this 808 list that are not on the 276 list. Yep, so what we can do go to name up at the top and then go to advanced and then where it says predefined fields you'll do name roll up on list and then you'll click that pop out so you want to find the names that are on the master list but not in that other one correct right the ones that are on this 808 but not on 276 okay so click on that 808 the number Yep. And then where it says predefined fields, go to name roll up again. And then you'll do not on. And then click the pop out and then click the 276. So we'll find all the names that are on that big one, but not on the small one. Now isn't there another step we do here? Yep, you'll just click that little magnifying glass up in the top right to run the search. And then let me just do some quick math here real quick. Yep, so there's the 532 names that are the different lists. Then you can do the select all results. And put them on a different roll-up. Yep. Then if you wanted to create a new list. Oh, add down here. Add roll-up. Okay. Yep. What's today's date? 8-11. Yep, and they'll start adding them. You'll see that little progress bar over to the left. Go ahead and hit close. Sometimes that ignores popped up on accident. So if you hit close, then go to roll ups up at the top. Okay, they're there. 532. Yep. Okay, cool. So you should be good to go. Appreciate that. Thank you. Yep, no problem. Have a good one, Adam. Okay, you too. Bye. Bye....
