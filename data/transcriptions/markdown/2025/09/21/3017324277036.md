## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. I'm looking for technical support with the email. Okay. What can I help you with? Okay, Robin. Just started with a new problem this morning. I'm trying to respond to email via PC Recruiter. When I hit reply, I'm getting this little teeny tiny box. Ah, okay. You already know what that is, huh? Yeah, we need to just have you clear cache in your browser. Are you in Chrome? Yes. Okay. If you go to the three vertical dots at the top right of your browser. Yep. Go down to delete browsing data and then don't do anything yet. Go to history, you mean, right? No, delete browsing data. Oh, got it. There you go. Sorry. Okay. So very important in this screen. I don't want you to delete things you're not supposed to. Right. And I'm so sorry. What is your name? I'm sorry. It's Bill Haig, William Haig. William Haig is probably how it's set up in the system. JGUA, if I remember right. Yep. Okay. Yep. All righty. So when you're in this delete browsing data screen, very important where it says time range, select all time. Untick everything, leaving only cached images and files selected. so download history browsing history uncheck everything you said yes yes uncheck everything i only want you to delete cached images and files okay delete there we go not much in there we'll see yeah sometimes when we like to kind of make a small patch or update your browser's trying to remember something about before and it's just clearing the cache right fixes it okay let me go back to the PC mail now and see if that helps? I would recommend first closing your browser. Got it. And then going back in. All right, I'll tell you what. I'm going to get out altogether, and I'll go back. There you go. That's closed it. Go back to PC Recruiter and sign in and see what happens. Just take a little while to load. Yeah, first time it might be a little slower. And that's what your cache is trying to do is like when you first go to something, it tries to remember it. That's why sometimes it gets a little confused and that kind of stuff happens. All right, let's go to email again. Here we go. Email. I'll just click on anyone and just hit as if I'm going to try to reply to it and see what happens here. Hey, solved the problem. How about that? So I just got it. I don't know why. I usually clean out my cache almost every other day. Maybe I just got lax on this. I think we had a little small update just removing an option somewhere for the chat option. So it could have been that. And if you went out and maybe then went in, it might have kind of cleared it anyway. But it probably was a little slight change to happen while you were logged in. Right, right. Yeah, and I know I saw something come in from you, I noticed yesterday or the day before, about new AI, something or another that can be used. I didn't get into it yet, but maybe that was it. I don't know. Okay, well, good. It looks like I'm all set. So thank you so much for your help. You are welcome. Have a great week. All right. Have a great day. You too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
