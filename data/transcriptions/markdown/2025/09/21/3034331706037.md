That makes no sense. Why were we paying for that? The owner, who is the person on here? I don't know who this is. Robert Eaton? Oh, he used to be in He used to be like a QA person a while back. Yeah, JT said he used to be in support and then started the QA department. Yeah. I guess so. Yeah, he was tech support, and they moved him over when they had a QA department.

Yeah. It takes forever. Oh, my gosh. I was, I literally, I got there, you know, I went there at 4.15 and I was out of there at 8.15 at night. Like, that's when I left. Four hours. But she, like, so, like, she finally gets to the top and done. And then, you know, shortly after, like, okay, let's rinse you out. And I remember thinking, like, there's no way that top is going to be processed enough. It's going to look yellow. and especially because I have greys up there now which is why I really have to get my hair done anymore because I have to get those damn things covered but we go to the boss she literally like took out the foils from the side that she started and then rinsed and then did the back but then I had to sit another 15 minutes to do the other side and she pulled those out and rinsed them and then she finally did the top I'm like I have never had where it finishes processing almost like on one side before you even like finish the top and she really did do a nice job though and then i finally just got to put i go you know you don't really have to dry it so she's like no i really want to see what it looks like i'm all excited about this i'm like all right oh that's cute she was really nice but yeah it was like one of those things like I'm desperately needing it done I have two funerals coming up I have one last well I had one before but then we have two we got one tomorrow night and then I have a fundraiser after that tomorrow night for one of my good friends she's running for mayor and then I have a birthday party Saturday another funeral I'm like I cannot be seen with these root grots anymore and that was The only time I get in, if I call my girl, I'd be waiting three, four weeks.
