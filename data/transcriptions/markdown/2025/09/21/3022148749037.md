## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Pat Capanna. I'm not available right now. Please write your name and number and I'll call you back. Thank you. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail that you're having trouble with PCR. Sorry, we missed your call. I'll respond via email and see if we can help you with the issue. I think you mentioned that you weren't able to log in or see PCR when you try to log in. So I'll give you some steps, maybe clearing cache will help via email. All right. Thanks so much....
