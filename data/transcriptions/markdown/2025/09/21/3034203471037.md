## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How can I help you? Hey, Garrett. My PCR email alias has gone wonky on me, and I'm wondering if you can talk me through how to fix it. Yeah, absolutely. Let me log into your database. What's your username for PCR? I think it's lsmith. Yep, that is working. Awesome. I'll check to make sure that it's just the alias that's disconnected. Have you guys been having more problems with this? Because I talked with my business partner and he said he was having some similar issues. No, it's basically if there's any passwords that get changed on your email account, you'll need to reestablish the connection from PCR to your mail provider. And also, mail providers will have you reconnect after a while, just if it hasn't been connected in a long time. Okay, that must be it. So, yeah, this is kind of, you know, routine. This will happen. But I'm checking. It looks like some of your mail servers might need connected, too. So I'll show you how to do both. So at the top right of PCR, go to the gear icon to the right of your profile picture. And there'll be a drop down where you can select email, the first option there. This will open up PCR mail in a new tab and you're looking for configure at the top left and another gear icon. And then let's start by going to... Mail servers. servers will be a good starting place here. Down below, it looks like you have three mail servers. Do you know which ones you're still using? We don't do Bluehost anymore. It's the G Suite. Okay. And then, so yeah, let's edit that. So at the very bottom where it says LORI IMAP new, use the action dropdown to the left of that to select edit. Now I'm worried that for some reason that might not be true. I can't imagine we're using Bluehost. I mean, our Gmail is through Gmail now. Yeah, it might be. So what we could do is just move that one to – We could do our website through Bluehost. Right, okay. That makes sense. Yeah, let me see. I'll check to see if there's anything in your inbox recently on that. Okay, yeah. Let's leave that Bluehost one on because you do have things in there from as recent as 7.26 date-wise. So I think it is being used. And that one is connected. That one doesn't need edited. And then let me check G Suite. Your inbox there hasn't really been set up. Okay. Okay, so yeah, I actually do think the LORI IMAP new through Bluehost is the correct and current mailbox. Let me make sure one thing on that, that you have your sent folder mapped. Okay, and your... Because the G Suite, you're not seeing anything at all? Yeah, it looks like it's empty when I go to the G Suite inbox there. Okay. whereas yeah the lorry has has stuff very recent 726 so can you read me what 726 is let's see the emails from Sierra clearance event 75% okay for that new text now I see how I can remember central open I'm up new emails it says no messages in box let's see Oh, okay. Thank you. Oh, wait, but it is showing. Yeah, no, this hasn't been used in a long time. Okay. There's just one email from 2025 that's a spam email, and then the other ones are like from 2024. Okay, so maybe it is G Suite, but G Suite does need reconnected again, I think might be the problem then. So let's look at that. So if you go back to configure up at the top, go to mail servers. Let's start by using the action drop down to the left of Lori IMF new and hit edit. And then where it says active at the bottom left, just switch that to no. So that one we know not to pay attention to anymore. The G Suite? No, the Lori IMF new. Okay, very good. Yeah. Okay. Yep. And so then once that's switched to no, just hit save. And we'll know not to pay attention to that one. Then for G Suite, use the action drop down to the left of that to go to edit again. And then click on sign in with Google at the bottom left. And that should prompt you to sign into the correct Google account. And it'll... You can post then to permanently delete all your email from Gmail. So I click on that. Yeah, you want to consent to anything and then continue. Okay. And then it should have filled out everything and reestablished the right password in there. Just a test connection down at the bottom. The password, for some reason, now has become a million words, so I'm going to enter it again. Oh, no, that's good. That's an encrypted password. That's what the clicking on the blue button did. It gave it the correct type of. So, yeah, if you backspace that, that's all right. You could just hit sign in with Google again. It'll enter in the encrypted password. So why does it have a weird password thing? It becomes encrypted so that it has extra security built into it. It's not going to be your your letter for letter password up there. OK, so test connection. Yeah, test connection. And we're hoping for green lettering somewhere in that test result. green lettering. I see nothing there. It says, okay, GI map ready for requests, capability, blah, blah, blah, buy logout requested...
