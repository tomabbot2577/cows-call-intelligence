## 💬 Full Transcript

 Jay Aaron, this is Glenn. Hi, Glenn. This is Jason calling from Main Sequence Technologies. How are you doing? Good, Jason. How about yourself? I'm pretty good. So I was just calling to just kind of check in with you with how PCR has been going for you lately. Did you have a second to talk? I've got about two minutes before I get to my destination and I have to get out of the car. But I got you for at least a little bit. Okay. I'm mainly just calling just to check in with you to see how things have been going, how PCR has been treating you, if there's any issues that you've been running into. Just general check in to see how things have been going. Overall, I'd say it's just as good a product as I've always had. I really haven't had any issues. It's obviously just been me for a while, so now I have a bunch of different users. and hopefully that'll be changing soon. But, you know, for the time being, it's worth just as good as it always has. Okay, perfect. Have you been reaching out to the support team recently or have you just been kind of just trapping along or do you use the support resources? Not really, just because I, honestly, I've been using the software for so long myself that I use it when I use it for. I know how to do it. So it's not common that something comes up where I need to use the support. Okay. Okay, cool. I just kind of wanted to check in with you. But if everything seems to be going good, I'm going to send you an email after this with just some general information about how to reach us, just some exciting stuff we have going on. And if you ever need us, feel free to reach us. Okay. I appreciate that. Awesome. Then you have a great day, Glenn. We'll see you later. You too, Jason. Thanks a lot. Bye....
