## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received a voicemail that you had some questions about PCR. Yes. Yeah, first thing I wanted to know is how would I be able to go in and, like, archive old files? I have, like, files from everywhere. From, like, 2015. How can I do that? Okay. You can... So are you wanting to basically just delete them out of your database? Not delete them, but just put them like in an archived file just in case. I guess I need them. Okay. So basically we have like deleting where it goes into a recycling bin and you can have it sit there or you can put them all on a roll up list. But there's no like archive, I guess, per se, where just all the records kind of stay in there unless you delete them and put them into the recycling bin. But the recycling bin can be accessed in the future to bring people out of that if maybe you want to use that route. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Okay, awesome. So let me double check here. I'll open up your database. and we want to make sure recycling bin turned on. Are you in the new territories client test database or professional search network recruiters inc database? The professional search network. Okay perfect all right and let's make sure All right, so when you open any record and go to the action menu at the top right of the record, there will be an option to delete. So that's the handful of icons that sit at the top right of a record. you can pin or unpin these. So if you're missing the trash can icon, you'll want to click the three horizontal lines at the top right of the record in order to find your unpinned action buttons. Okay. Okay. So I'm looking for a trash can. Yeah. So do you have a record pulled up currently, a name record? Yeah, I'm looking. I see a whole bunch of stuff, but no trash can. Okay, try all the way to the right, clicking the three horizontal lines to the right of all those icons. Okay. And then in that drop-down menu, there should be a trash can somewhere in there. If not, you may not have it. I got it. Oh, no. Oh, good. It's just a little – it's a delete button. yeah exactly delete record trash can so you can click on that on any record and it'll place them in the recycling bin um and here let me i'm going to create a quick name record for myself in your database and delete it just to test to make sure that that's all turned on so um let me just make one for me here but i'm able am i able to go in and do it from like let's say i don't know 2000 to 2015, something like that. Okay. So you want to look at records that were created in that date range or you can... Yeah, I want to take those records that are old and move them into the recycle so that I would still be able to access them. But I just don't want them cluttering up everything. So my question is, are you able to do it like from a date? Let's say if I say, you know, 2010 to 2015 or something like that, I don't have to go in and click everyone and put it in the recycle, do I? No, so you can build a search and say, show me all the records with this certain criteria. So the question is, would it be records that are created in that date range or records that have a last activity in that date range? meaning some action was taken on that record their last activity is in that date range um yeah i i don't i'm trying to think because i want to do like i don't know 2008 to 2015 okay so yeah it sounds like you would want to say any record where their last activity happened in that date range you want to move to the recycling bin rather than any record that was created in those date ranges moved through cycling bin because you you could still be in conversation with people currently from that if they were created back then um so to do that you would just go to activities in the main menu at the top center of pcr okay and then um this is your activity search and you can say here let me let me actually pull this up I have your database open I want to make sure this is the quickest route I don't want to give you the scenic route here activity search okay yeah maybe not actually I I'm going to try a different this might actually be quicker, one second. So I could go to... Okay. Last activity is lifespan... I'll say one... So is it only going to put the contact records into the recycle bin if, let's say, you go to the last time they were contacted, right? But what about if they weren't contacted and there's not a lot of information in there? Yeah, that might be a different search we would build. Let's see. And I am checking a recycling bin now just to make sure it's all functioning. So there is no way to, once they're in the recycling bin, there's no way to, like, select in bulk and say, put all these back into my database. It would have to be one at a time. You can hit restore next to each one. Yeah, that's fine. Okay, good. Got it. All right. So, and I figured out the best way to search for the records that you want to find, I think. So, let's start by goi...
