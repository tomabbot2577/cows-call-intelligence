## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Garrett. I was looking for some support on the PCR software. Sure. How can I help you today? I just inherited a computer that had the software on, and it has not been used in a while. So I'm thinking there may be some update issues, but I know I'm having issues with the capture. Oh, okay. but I know I'm having issues with the capture. Okay. Yeah, so the capture tool, are you using it on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge? It's actually Chrome. Chrome, perfect. All right, so at the top right of your browser, click the three dots, then go to extensions, manage extensions. Okay. And then at the top right, turn on developer mode. There'll be a toggle there. It's on. This will give us the version numbers of each one of your extensions. And so PCR capture should be at version 1.1.9. Is that the one you have? It is. Okay, that's good. And then let's see if you're signed into the tool. So at the top right of the browser, there'll be a few icons. One will look like a puzzle piece. Hopefully next to that, you'll see the PCR capture logo up there at the top right. Okay, if you click on that, does it have a list of websites or does it have a space to put in your PCR URL? It looks like a list of websites, like LinkedIn Recruiter, LinkedIn Recruiter Lite, LinkedIn Symbols. Okay, excellent. So those can all be toggled on. They usually are by default, so that's good. At the bottom right where it says basic mode, is that turned off or on? It's off. Oh, good. Okay. Keep that one off. All right. So it looks like everything is set up correctly with the capture tool. So if you go to LinkedIn, like a LinkedIn profile, Is it just not appearing on the right where it's supposed to say, like, click to add? No, that does appear. And then I click on that, click on that, and then I can do the review, the submit. And then it's just not showing up. And maybe I should just start with this. It's not showing up in the recently added folder, roll up. Oh, okay. So you would have to set that up inside of the Capture Tools layout to say, I want to be able to put this into a specific roll-up. So let's check on that. So if you go to just any LinkedIn profile that you want to capture, and we'll just click to add to start the process. Now that I said that, now it's not the bottom. That's weird. So are you on a LinkedIn profile right now and it's not showing up? I am. We heard that. There it went. That was weird. It wasn't weird. Oh, gotcha. Yeah, if you hit click to add, do you see in the fields that it's listing there that it's capturing? If you scroll down, does it have one that says add to roll up one of the fields for the name record? Let me see. it doesn't have that listed that we can add it in yeah where would it show that because at the top i've got you know select the duplicate duplicates and then i've got oh okay that's all that's good so i guess i'm going to go to review okay and then go to the next one submit okay here we go and then add to roll-up. Yep, that's what we're doing. Awesome. Yeah, so if you should be able to type in the roll-up you want to add it to or select it from the drop-down, excellent. Yeah, yeah. I'll bet that's it. Okay. Well, now I know where they all went. That'll be easy. I just have to go back and move them. All right. So I guess, will that default or is there any way to set it up? Or does it save as last, whatever was selected last? No, so you can set it to have a default roll-up plugged in there. To do that, is the capture tool still open right now on your screen? At the top right, there's like a pencil kind of edit pen and paper icon. Click on that. and then scroll down to that group that has add to roll-up in it and actually select the roll-up here while you're editing the layout, and then that will be saved as your default moving forward. Okay, perfect. Yeah, next time you try to capture somebody, you should already have your default selected roll-up. I guess there's not a save to that edit. Oh, there's a save. Oh, yeah, bottom right there. Yeah, okay. All right, I bet that is my only issue that I'm having. Let's see, let me make sure. I also had an error message uploading a resume. Oh, okay. And the message was document does not contain any text. It was a PDF. Yeah, we've seen that before. So basically, PDFs can either contain actual text or they can just contain a picture of text. Right. And the best way to tell is if you open the PDF and you try to highlight some text, and if you can't highlight it, then it's just like a photo or an image of text. And so TCR needs a version of the PDF that actually has text in it. Okay. Gotcha. So, yeah. On the sidebar then, you know how to export it as a text? Let's see. Yeah. So, did you get that from maybe like a candidate somewhere? Maybe you can say, are you able to send this with actual text in it or in a different format like maybe a Word document would kind of ensure that? Yeah, so there's no way for me to convert it. Yeah, not in PCR. There might be... Yea...
