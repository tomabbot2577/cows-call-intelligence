## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Eric Rudd. How are you? Good. How are you, Eric? Good, thanks. So I have a couple of issues happening right now. One of them is invalid email credentials, and the other is a question or two about building a roll-up. yeah let me pop in and take a look here okay Len do you use the admin username I'm sorry what was that what username do you use when logging into the database admin yes I think okay perfect alright let me take a look here okay all right so yeah it looks like we just need to reauthenticate your email alias okay so hey can I I'm sorry I've got a medical caller right now can I ask you to just hold for one second please yep okay I'm sorry thank you so much all right sorry about that. Oh, not a problem. All right. So, for the email alias, you're going to go into PC Recruiter, you're going to go to System. Okay. Let me get there. Okay. System. And then Email Setup. Email Setup. Got it. And then you click Email Alias List over on the right. Okay, email alias list. Okay, for me, that's from the left, but I got it. Okay. And then you'll click the little pencil that you see next to your email alias. Since you're using Office 365, you'll just do that sign in with Microsoft option. Okay. You'll just follow the prompts, or if you already have the cookie stored, it might take you just straight back there. Yep, it took me straight back. Okay, perfect. Now go ahead and hit test connection. Okay. And if you see at the bottom, if it says status in green and says test completed, you're good to go. Okay, great. So you'll just exit out of that test connection box and just make sure you hit save when you're done. All right, very good. Thank you. Yep. And then what did you have a question about with the roll-up list? Yeah, so, you know, I want to build a roll-up, and I might need to share my screen with you because I have a couple of questions, if we can do that. Yeah, let me get this started here. I'll email you over a link. So go ahead and start describing it while I get that together. I can kind of get a game plan. So I've noticed a new way to possibly build an email, a roll-up, jeez. You know, towards the upper right of my screen, I see that search window. And, you know, like I can pop some things in there, like estimator. And it will bring up every estimator. I have 672 estimators in my database. Can I just grab all of these and throw them into a roll-up? Not from the quick search, no. Boy, that would be so convenient. Like, to me, building a roll-up seems very technical. And I'm just saying this for a suggestion. This would be great. So that's why we still have the main search functions like the basic and advanced searches. The quick search is designed, it runs differently than the regular searches. So it's not designed to have that kind of capacity. Okay. All right. I just got your meeting link here, so I'm going to click it. And then I'll let you in here. Then you can just hit continue without audio since we're on the phone here. Okay. So how do we? You can just exit out of the. You can just exit out of the. Okay. Yep. Got it. Then at the bottom of the meeting window, you'll see a blue box with an arrow in it that says share. Yep. And then you'll want to share your entire screen. So you'll click on which screen you want to share, and then you'll hit share again in the pop-up box. Okay. So entire screen, and then... Share's not lighting up for me. Still gray. Do you have the screen that you want to share clicked on and highlighted in yellow? No, I see. Okay. All right. So now I can share that. Okay. Yep. Perfect. Now I can see you. All right. Okay. All right. So essentially, you know, like I said, I was doing this over here. estimators brings up 672 would be so awesome to just pull those over, but I know we can't do that. So, you know, I want to build a roll-up, and I was looking, because I don't do this much, and I just kind of forget. How do I get rid of this over here now? Okay, it's gone. So, I kind of need some help building a roll-up, and I know you just go into name and then advanced searches and then I think like I've built some in the past so I can see all my saved searches here. So I was kind of using. I think I'm on the other PCR screen I think that you have open. Oh okay. All right. Let me. Are you in this one? Yep. Okay so let me get out of that. So I know you go into name and then advanced. And so advanced. And then, like, I know I have some saved searches here. But to me, it always gets a little technical here as to the best way to build this here. Whoops, that's not what I wanted. So, you know, like if I select, are you still there? Yep. Okay. Somebody else, I left a message for PC Recruiter, so they're calling me back. I'm just going to decline that. Oh, yeah. That might be Garrett. Yeah. I'll let them know. Okay. Thank you. So, like, I see over here, like, if I look at this one, this is one t...
