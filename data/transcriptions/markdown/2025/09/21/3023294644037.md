## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hey, how's it going? I have Jim Ortman on the phone with waterjobs.com. He is looking to put his account on some kind of, if there's a maintenance mode or like low-cost mode. He's going in the hospital for the next few months, so he was just wanting to call about that. Perfect. Yeah, I can talk to him. I'll help him do it. All righty. I'll transfer him now. Thanks. All righty. Thanks, sir. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Yes, this is Jim. Yeah. Jim, how are you? Yes, Jim Ortman of Water Jobs. I'm going into the hospital for some corrective surgery, and it's going to be at least two, possibly three, maybe even four weeks, excuse me, four months before I return to work. so I'd like to put my account on on hold until I get back to back to work here okay that is certainly something we can do what we do is we kind of put it into like maintenance mode puts it on hold so it's not accessible but it's still there that you can turn it back on as soon as you're ready it's only 20 bucks a month just to keep that going oh that's fine yeah what I can do let me put in a ticket and have my accounting team sent over there there's a little form they'll have you fill out, and then they'll switch it over, update the billing, and get everything switched over to get you on hold. But I will put that into the system today, have them get it moving. Okay. Thank you so much. Certainly. Thank you, sir. All right. Bye-bye. Bye....
