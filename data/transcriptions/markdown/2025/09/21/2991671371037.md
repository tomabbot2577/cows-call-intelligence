**[0:00] Speaker_01:** Hi, thanks for calling me back.

**[0:02] Speaker_01:** How are you doing?

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** I'm good.

**[0:03] Speaker_00:** How are you?

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** This is Robin.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** Yes, I'm there, Robin.

**[0:06] Speaker_01:** How are you doing?

**[0:07] Speaker_00:** I'm pretty good.

**[0:09] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I'm really confused.

**[0:10] Speaker_01:** I mean, I've been a long-time customer, and they changed my credit card.

**[0:15] Speaker_01:** I put a new credit card in, and then I got this note.

**[0:18] Speaker_01:** I don't know, did my credit card, because one of my credit cards was compromised.

**[0:22] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[0:23] Speaker_01:** So I'm not sure, you know, because I always had the automatic, you know, billing.

**[0:31] Speaker_00:** So here's what happened.

**[0:33] Speaker_00:** We changed billing systems, and you had to put in your card information on the new system, at least for the first invoice.

**[0:42] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I did that.

**[0:44] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I did that.

**[0:45] Speaker_00:** Yeah, when did you do that?

**[0:47] Speaker_00:** Because I'm wondering if it was like after, like maybe you didn't pay the invoice, but you put the card in.

**[0:52] Speaker_00:** So your next one will probably auto pay?

**[0:55] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I paid the invoice.

**[0:57] Speaker_01:** I did.

**[0:57] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[0:58] Speaker_01:** Yeah, I did that.

**[1:00] Speaker_01:** But, I mean, that's...

**[1:02] Speaker_00:** Because I do see one open that was 615, but then it says updated 624.

**[1:09] Speaker_00:** So maybe you put the card information in, but it didn't process that invoice.

**[1:13] Speaker_00:** But it is set up for auto pay.

**[1:15] Speaker_01:** Yeah, it's set up for auto pay.

**[1:18] Speaker_01:** Okay, can I give you the credit card again?

**[1:20] Speaker_01:** you could put me in for auto pay?

**[1:22] Speaker_00:** It might just be I need to reprocess this because it was showing that it is set up for auto pay.

**[1:28] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:30] Speaker_01:** My wife just gave me the bill.

**[1:33] Speaker_01:** On 6-15, my credit card was checked.

**[1:36] Speaker_01:** It was $72.99.

**[1:38] Speaker_01:** $72.91 was charged from PC Recruiter.

**[1:44] Speaker_02:** That's where I'm confused.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[1:46] Speaker_00:** Let me look in my other system too.

**[1:49] Speaker_02:** Yeah.

**[1:50] Speaker_00:** okay I have a payment on 515 no this says here here my I'm holding my wife with all kids thank you yeah you're right 515 we thought it said 615 yeah I have a 515 so right now is this the June one now you do have auto pay enabled let Let me see what your payment method is.
