## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi there, this is Connie. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I received your voicemail that you're having trouble in PCTR. Well, what happened after I left the message for support is that we, my owner, my boss, he called about ProtoScore. And there was a problem with ProtoScore having to be reset. I think what happened when the RingCentral thing went down yesterday, in other words, I wasn't an admin, so I couldn't use that particular function with PCR. And then we had a phone call at like 6 or 6.30 last night. Long story longer, we finally got it fixed. Oh, good. Yes. So AI, I mean, I'm using it now, and I was able to get in and use it. But I think the initial one where I kept getting an error every time I tried to load the roll-up, I kept getting this error message. And so I went back to the owner and I said, you know, maybe just shut down the whole system and reboot, and that solved the problem. Oh, excellent. Yeah. That is a good troubleshooting step, believe it or not. That fixes a lot of things a lot of the time, so that's great that that ended up working for you. Well, yeah. I mean, I'm not nearly at your level, but I've worked on computers like many of us in the professional trades enough where we're like refresh, reboot. You know, sometimes when a storm is hitting, power goes out. Like I had a, not yesterday, but the day before, a power issue with storms in the area. And some of my pinned tabs just did not come back on Chrome. Oh, okay. I'm like, I got a lot of stuff pinned. And so I just found the ones that were missing one at a time, tried to add them back. It's just the way it is. Yeah, with the power issues, it does mess things up a little bit sometimes. I've had that happen too. Yes, it does. Anywho, I appreciate you calling. Sorry to waste your time, but we got it fixed. No worries. I'm glad it's working for you. Just reach out if you have any other questions. Okay, I sure will. I probably will. I'm new here. I'm happy to help. We are happy to help. All right. Have a great rest of your day. Me too. Bye bye....
