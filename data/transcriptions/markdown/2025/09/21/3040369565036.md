## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. Sequin, this is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Ben Williams. How are you doing? Hi, Ben. I'm good. How are you doing? Happy summer. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Almost over, right? Oh, shh. Don't say that. Hey, did you say we were going to go? I live in Cleveland. I'm wanting to extend this as long as possible. That's right. I forget. You guys get kind of – you don't get a lot of summer, huh? no and then once it's over it's like gray skies for months so it used to be that way in po not so much anymore so yeah actually they were somebody was just complaining i'm like stop complaining because in a couple months you're going to be you know all upset about uh you know the cold and the winter and the dreariness uh absolutely i don't like the short days. That's the only thing that bothers me anymore. Yes. I like having where it's like, you know, I'm not coming, like, ending work and it's already dark out. Yeah. I hate that. That's the only thing that bothers me. I don't move to the car in the car. I need a little sunshine in my life. Yeah. Exactly. Vitamin D is efficient during that period, for sure. Did you send me the video of our last conversation? Did I send a video of your last conversation? Yeah, we recorded it. Not a conversation, a last training. If I have it, when would that have been? Oh, good question. It was only a week or so ago, but let me look. Let me look. How do I search this thing? 21st? Okay, we'll get on with that. 21st. Okay, so let's see. The 21st, oh, I see that we had a meeting at around 10 a.m. Let me see if I have that. Let's see, where do those go? Meet recording. So it says, we automatically go here. Oh, maybe they go here. Oh, I'm trying to find, how do they store these? I don't know, where do they put them automatically? All right. Okay. Let's see. Found it. Share. Anyone with the link. Okay. Do I have to go back into that thing? Yeah, I believe I would have sent that to you. It does say anyone with a link. Normally it's just people I work with. I probably would have forwarded it in an email. I'm looking right now. I only have an email on the 21st. I bet they participate in following. Yeah, we definitely want to come later that day because the meetings are typically an hour. They take a while to generate. Yeah. So I don't end up usually sending them until like hours later. Yeah, I don't have any email from your Robin Martoni email. yeah I just sent it to you okay that's from the 21st so you should be all set now okay so I call I have another question so Gareth asked me questions about the split desk and you gave us those new reports so what we've done in the the way we pay our commission is you know there's always say this is a place or we play off of the adjusted gross profit. And one person gets 10% of it, the other person gets 7% of it. So I'm pretty sure we used a split desk or something similar to that before. Or is there a better way to do that? So all I want to do – Well, is it off timesheets? You can't really do splits off timesheets, I believe. because anything with analytics as far as yeah I don't think I think it only applies to the perm because really with the analytics it only takes like what you put in like an estimate it doesn't run off actual hours yes we see you probably do that manually outside of PCR no we definitely we definitely did it automatically maybe the uploading the hours was was manual if I remember but everything all the reports ran the same way I just don't I'm trying to think of work reports that we that were ran so let me just go back to the supports So the contract commission report, is that a standard report or is that a custom one that was made for us? Anything under, let me see, I'd have to see your database one second. Is it under QL or? No. Then it would probably be like a built-in report. I'm pretty sure, I know we never went on the custom SQL. And maybe there was a different process back then. But we would go to contract temp. I'm pretty sure I thought we ran a commission report. And none of those reports are pulling any data down. So that's probably close to the hours are there. Yeah for any of those reports those are usually based on hours. If somebody's having timesheets. Okay so how do I how do I do the hours again? How do I upload the hours you would either have to have people doing a setting timesheets or you have to go up to contract and then go to contract a main table go to hours they need to have to enter the hours for the person and then hit search okay so I got in profit let's see it got kind of like there's a timesheet export burden profit, which is a custom SQL, but that wouldn't have like your custom commission stuff in it. Yeah. So, okay. So I'm looking at this. I did, I ran the hours. Yeah. I don't contract commission. So how do I import the hours? You can't import the hours. You'd have to go to hours, pick your week and hit search. yep I'm there and then yeah I make sure you're in the right week but then when y...
