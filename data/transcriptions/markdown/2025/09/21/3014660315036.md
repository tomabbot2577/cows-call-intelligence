But I will just forget my... Okay, and your name is? Tracy McBride. Tracy McBride. Okay. Oh, I think I talked to Ann earlier today. Oh, did you? Yeah. Yeah. Like, wait a minute, that company name looks familiar. Why? I think I was just in this record. Yes. Okay. Let's see here. okay so you're trying to use pcr capture is that the issue right well yeah and usually i when i'm in indeed like i click on a resume it usually that little capture box comes up and i can click on it and then at least get it that if it's a new person into the system okay Could be a couple different things. Do you happen to have RingCentral? Yes. You do? Okay. Let's meet using RingCentral. I need to take over some screen control. Sometimes it's easier. I mean, we don't really use it, but I know I have it. Okay. So if you open up your RingCentral app. Okay. How do I do that? Just go to hold on. Okay. If I'm in my apps, let's see. RingCentral, hold on. Oh, come on. Okay. Hold on. Why isn't it searching for me? Because that's the first thing whenever I restart, it comes up. I could do it another way. I mean, we could just do a Google Meet if you want. Yeah, that's fine. oh I got it okay if it goes to ring central okay okay oh I got to sign in I don't even know what our account is we don't use it I have it but okay hold on Tracy I'm trying to sign in Let me see if it lets me. I don't know what my password is. Okay. It's okay. I'll just send you a Google Meet. Let me just. Okay. Sorry. That's okay. Don't worry about it. I obviously have it, but we don't use it. Okay. So let's see. So is it Tracy at PFNRI? Is that the? Correct. Okay. New meeting. I probably didn't have to do it that way. Okay. She's got something that's got like a meeting link in it. It would come from Robin at mainsequence.net. Yeah, I just, yeah. Okay. Okay. I'm hitting. Okay, so you're going to join with Google Meet. Okay. And we don't need camera or microphone since we're already on the phone. And we're going to be watching the screen, not your camera. Gotcha. Okay. Let me put my name in. Yes. That just lets me know who's joining. Okay, so I've got to admit you. Okay. All right, so if you can go at the bottom of your meeting screen, there's an option called share screen. rectangle with an arrow that points up. Mm-hmm. Click on that. Okay. And you'll be prompted to go over to entire screen. Okay. Share. Yes. not showing anything did you click on the screen to show over when you click entire screen gives you kind of usually like a preview there you go okay all right ignore that this is bouncing around uh if you can go over to i guess you're probably using chrome when you're in indeed okay so go over to Chrome. So we want to keep this tab open, but we're going to like just ignore it. Okay. So let's go ahead and go over to LinkedIn or I'm sorry, Indeed. Do you want me to log into this? Well, are you using PCR capture to bring them in? yes so here's an example i'll go and i this person can you can you see my screen okay i go like this then i click on her okay so this is opening an edge okay okay that i don't want it to open an edge but i don't know how to change yeah that's just because you're in outlook and it's going to open its own programs. What if you click on Sarah's name again? Usually that box comes up and I can click and it's not coming up. What if you click on Sarah's name again? Like so you're actually going into her profile. Oh, that's just a clipboard. Okay. I'm just wondering if it's how we're getting to her thing. Resume. Yeah. Yeah. Like it might be like a different way that how you're open. Is there like a view profile option? Yeah, see here, if let's say I do a search, let me see what happens. Let's see if I open her up. I don't know. Can you click directly on the extension for me? Up at the top of your browser? Yes. Well, this is now in Chrome, so that's not where we have it. go over to the one in edge yeah you have to add them separately for chrome or edge because they're different browsers um can you click directly on the extension for me over at the left like that purple green and blue one so this is in your edge browser oh yeah yeah sorry yeah okay and you want them going into it's called the default company right yeah okay so you do a lot of things turned off here for some reason that's probably why I don't yeah but I don't have them turned off in Chrome is that but yeah it's Chrome and Edge are going to be separate they're two different browsers so see all these little sliders you're going to have to turn those on I don't know why they would get turned off I don't know yeah and then scroll down li...
