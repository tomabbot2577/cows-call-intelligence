## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, Julian Reeves with Chapel Solutions again. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Hey, I changed my password on Google, and I'm not sending out emails. and I forget how to do like the third-party access but I think it helped oh sure okay yeah let me log in to chapel I'll just follow along here this database are you just in the mr. Chapel Hill database or a different one in that list? Yeah it's called CHS healthcare is the database. Oh perfect okay and then what is your username for PCR? It's jreeves24. Okay And I will just go to the email settings here, double check. Yeah, so if a password is updated, you usually do have to readjust your settings in PCR. Yep, the connection is not going through on that one. Let me check the mail servers as well. This one, no. No. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. So at the top right of your browser, or top right of PCR, I mean, go to the little gear icon next to your profile picture and select email in that dropdown, the top option. That'll open up PCR mail in a new tab. Okay. And then go to configure at the top left, another gear icon. Got it. And then there's an incoming email setting. We'll adjust in an outgoing email setting. So let's start with the outgoing. So go to Alias Address List, the top center there. And then in the bottom frame, click on the pencil icon next to that Gmail alias. Okay. And then just click Sign In with Google, and it should prompt you to sign in. Okay. If you have a window that pops up and disappears, it means you're already signed in on the browser and it'll autofill, but if not, just sign into the correct account there. Okay. And then once that's set up, just hit test connection down at the bottom. So is the application specific password required for more information, invalid second factor, and some other stuff there. All right. So in that case, we'll go to just hit save on that after closing the test. And let's do this. Go to the kind of the top right of your browser next to the three dots is your like your icon with either your initials or your photo for Google. Yep. Yep. Click on that and go to manage. Oh, go ahead. On what screen again? It's kind of to the left of the three dots at the top right of your browser. There's an icon for your Google account. It might have your initial in a circle. Oh, go to my Google account. Got it. Okay. Yep, I'm here. And then manage your Google account. We'll open up your settings there. And then we want to go to security on the left. Okay. Let's see. Then there's a heading called how you sign into Google. Select two-step verification on that. It's buried in here. That's where it is. I was like, where is it? And when you click on two-step verification, it's turned on, right? It doesn't have an option to say turn it on. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, it is on, yeah. So that's good. And then at the bottom of that page, the two-step verification page, it should say app passwords down at the bottom. Yes, that's exactly what I was looking for. Okay. So, yeah, I would go in there and I would create a new app and just name it like PCR, PC Recruiter, even if you had an older one. and then you want to copy and paste that new generated app password. Great. Okay, that's what I needed. I couldn't find this, and I was like... Yeah, it gets buried in there. The one thing, though, you do want to paste this somewhere and remove the spaces, the space characters from that password, and then recopy it. So if you have like a notepad or something, you could paste it in. Oh, yeah. I actually just pasted it and it worked, which is great. Oh, it worked? Okay. Well, that's good then. Yeah, you're in good shape. So that's the outgoing mail. Let's double check the incoming mail and make sure we can get that set up as well. So if you're still in PCR mail, go to the mail servers at the top left. and then down below oh it looks like you have two let's see it looks like the second one is the probably the one you want to adjust by going to the action drop down and edit okay It says, okay, okay, bye. Save. If it has, okay, yeah. If you hit save, I'll just kind of refresh and test the connection and see the error myself here. Okay, I'm refreshing. Okay. I had a lot of job. Okay. Here, let me refresh one more time, make sure I get the latest. And you were editing the Julian CHS one, right? That's the description. It says Julian CHS. Yes, exactly. Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, for that one, if it says the okay, quote, the raven, nevermore, or that strange little error there. So that means you do have to take out the spaces on this side of things. So I would go ahead and paste that into like a notepad or something. We're going to notes. Okay, that's good. I see a green okay. Excellent. Thank you. So, yeah, you should be in good shape now. Just make sure to save that. Yeah, and you should be able to send and receive, monitor the receiving emails too for activities. Great. Thank you...
