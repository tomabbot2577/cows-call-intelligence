I got your email here a little bit ago. to see it's Jim Lombardo with PC recruiter how are you hi Jim I'm well how are you pretty well pretty well I wanted to give you a quick call I got your email here a little bit ago you're looking for a data export I just wanted to let you know yeah I can get that ticket in it'll need Jason's signature since he's the signer on record okay and that is just the database called final that's the only one you need yeah I think that's the only one we have is Kleinhirsch final. Perfect, perfect. And if you don't mind my asking, how come you need it? Is everything okay? We just want to make sure nothing's gone wrong or anything, if you're unhappy at all. No, I mean, I think we just need to understand, because I don't know if I spoke to you or I spoke to somebody earlier about like how many records we had in our system. And, you know, I think we're just thinking about, you know, how clean is our data and yeah. Okay, very good. Because I know when I put it in, support's going to ask me because they always want to make sure it's not somebody that's already leaving or signed with someone else or anything like that. So I just wanted to make sure it wasn't that you were absolutely leaving us. So I always like to ask. Yeah, I understand. Very good. Very good. Well, so it's not that. I will just kind of put the ticket in and get that on the way. I think Nick usually sends out the form and everything like that. And I think it's $175 to get it for each one. Okay, perfect. Sounds good. Very well. All right. Thanks much. Okay. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
