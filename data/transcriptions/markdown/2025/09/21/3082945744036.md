## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Oh, hey, Robin. It's Luke from Spectrum. Hi, how are you? Hey, good. How are you? Pretty good. Come on in. Yeah, so this is more of a general question, and I'm sorry. I feel like I ask you these things constantly. Job security. So I'm curious. I'm trying to do a few things with automations for somebody. Okay. And I've just never been able to find a way to do this. So I'm wondering if this is like, if there's an obvious way to do this that I'm missing. Basically, what I want to do is I just want whenever a specific person writes an activity, I want to add them to a roll up. there is not a way to do that there's a way when you write a an activity that it goes to a roll-up but not if it's only written by a specific person right i've been trying like the last 20 minutes to think of a workaround because i know yeah i know obviously we can automate activity written add to roll up and i know we can do activity searches for people um okay and and so now we could maybe do like a custom script to prompt them to put them into the rollup if they're not in it, but they basically be like a search under my PCR, which could trigger a pop-up whenever it's greater than one, but then they would just see those results and then have to put them into the rollup. Yeah. And that's, I mean, that would be a workaround. That would be a workaround. So what I have now is just, you know, my PCR search where it's searching for those people that an activity was written by that user, and then you can just go to it, select them all, and add them yourself. Now, do you have in your script, though, that they're not in the list yet? No, but I guess... That might help. That might help, though, at least. What database is this for? Our Spectrum careers. Okay. And what's the username with the query? It would be under my username. Okay. What is that? Yeah. Elsie. Okay. Now we, to be honest, I mean that, that would, that might help a little bit, but I have it already set to like, these are people that, you know, have been contacted in the last week. So it's not like the list is getting massive. And if you, if you move, or if you copy candidates from a list like that into a rollup, it should ignore the duplicates anyways. So, um, Yeah. Cause what I could do is change the script that basically looking for the same thing, you know, if it's written by this user within this timeframe, but they're not on the list. So if it ever goes above zero, you can at least get a prompt thrown. Yeah. I mean, what do you mean by a prompt thrown? Like a notification or? Yeah. Well, it'll be like a little prompt that pops up. Here, let me change one for you. Hold on. You get like a lot of scripts, I think. You're my PR page. It takes a while. I have so many scripts in there. Just like I've been using it as like a library of scripts. So some things like if you really don't need to have it when it goes like when you log in, you might want to just kind of rebuild it under the advanced search as a saved. So that way, whenever you're loading your my because what's happening when you click my PCR, it's trying to load every one of those. Right. Running all of those at the same time. Right. Yeah. And that's what's slowing it down. OK, what is the name of the query you have right now? I just threw it at the bottom. It's like CZ. It's the very last one. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's looking in the past seven days. Okay. I'm going to copy this out. I'll just give you an example. And then if it helps, great. We keep it. If not, then we move on. But unfortunately, what I don't have is only if the activity is written by that person. Okay. Candidate. Okay. So we're looking for that. Do you think. And candidate ID not in. Select candidate. What is the name of the roll-up that you're going to want the person in? I was just kind of using a generic test one. this is more just like a you could put them in really any test if you just search test you can put them in any of those that have like one person on them or something I can always change that out yeah so we do like an example even if we do an example with me at least you can see what this prompt is what I mean by it What rule of should I use as a test for her? Should I do the test import GT? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. So that's 095. Okay. Okay. And I want where they're not in. Okay. So I'm going to add, go back to my PCR. Oops. I'm going to add another query just below. Just so you can see what I mean. Okay, so this is going to look for an activity of either spoke with or email. So. Okay. Did you get a prompt just now? You know, I'm actually away from my desk. Hold on one second. Or click my PCR. When something matches, it should prompt it, but since I'm also in... Mm-hmm. I'm assuming, yeah, I just have to wait for my PCR to load. While I wait on this. So do you think, I mean, do you think that, like, the dev team or something might have any interest at all in Like, probably not. No. Any...
