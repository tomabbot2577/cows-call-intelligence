## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. This is Soma Sive. How are you? I'm well. Soma, how are you? I'm doing well. Thank you. Tag, you're it. Yeah. Wanted to connect. I'm glad we finally did. Wanted just to chat with you a little bit, learn about your database, see if you were looking for a data return, why you were leaving, kind of just that basic stuff. Yeah, so, I mean, there's nothing to do with PCR. I love PCR. It's just that my recruiting business is pretty, it's very slow at the moment, and I'm kind of seeing myself exiting the recruiting field. Okay. So I wouldn't, and actually I haven't been actively using PCR. I've just been downloading, you know, resumes into the database, but I'm kind of leading recruiting, if you will. Okay. And you're not the first I've heard that from lately. So that's going around a bit. And do you need the database? Do you need a data return or no? You know what? Is there a cost to that if I say yes? It is. It's $1.75 to make it available. Okay. So it is a little bit of a cost there. Yeah. We keep it kind of archived here for a year or two. So if you ever did need it, You could give us a call and spin it back up if you needed to. So that would be something that you should be able to do if you needed it. So if you didn't want to get it now, it's still here for a little while. It's just after about a year. We don't always have it. We usually do between you and me. But sometimes there could be a chance that you wouldn't have it. Yeah. I mean, I don't think I need it because I have my connection on LinkedIn anyway. now my question is I know that I've been with PCR I don't know how long now and you said that I'm under the current track I'm under contract until January so they'd be early termination fees there might be so there could be with the offer a long long time mm-hmm yeah sometimes if if you're on a contract, most of our contracts auto-renew. So whenever you originally signed it, it'll auto-renew each year on that. And I'm trying to get back into my database. I just had to reboot everything locked up, so I'm just getting into everything here and it's taking me a minute. But yeah, so whenever... Whenever, so yeah, so it would be, yeah, I can't do, I don't have anything up now. But yeah, whenever it'll auto renew. So if you still are under contract, the early termination fee is 80% of remaining payments due. So be aware of that. That could be happening. I don't remember off the top of my head what it was, and I don't have access to it to look. but that could be my accounting team would let you know for sure. And sometimes you can mention to them that you're shutting down the business. Maybe they'll waive it or reduce it. I don't unfortunately have any say in that, but Robin is usually able to talk to ownership and see. Yeah, things do find out because I know I've been with you guys for a long time, so if there's a certain term that I need to stay on with PCR, or I think I've accomplished that or exceeded that or something. But, yeah, I mean, like I said, I think I'm going to be leaving the industry, so I'm not going to probably be recruiting. So I don't know. So can you find out for me if there is an early termination, even though, like I said, I've been there with y'all for quite some time? Yeah, I'll see what it is, see what it is. Oh, I should be able to get in here now. Okay, let me get signed in. And again, it hasn't to do with y'all's software. It's just, I'm going to get out because we're creating a short flow these days. And if you're getting from other people, yeah. Yeah, I've had other people saying that, that they're just, somebody I just talked to today said they, whatever industry, a pharmaceutical industry, that's what they were in. And she said it's just, it's gotten very slow and they don't see it turning around in the next year or two. So they just said they're cutting costs and just trying to limit that. She said we're not really doing anything with the database anymore, so we have to close it. So let's see. So I have your original agreement here. It looks like it was signed in 2017, January. And it was a one year in January. so it would be a one year so you're under contract technically until January so that could be a few more months 80% of whatever the remaining payments do for that would be but I'll note in there that we'd like to see if there's anything we can do about that since you're shutting down and not recruiting so see if there's anything I'll note in there yeah please find out if there's anything at all you know, any reduced costs or something. Because I know, like I said, since I've been here with 2017, that's what, eight years? Eight years? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, just let me know, Jim. Will do. I'll put it in the ticket. I'll request it in the ticket. And then likely you'll hear back from either Robin or Nick, because those are the two people on our team here who handle the cancellations. They'll work with you on that to get everything figured ...
