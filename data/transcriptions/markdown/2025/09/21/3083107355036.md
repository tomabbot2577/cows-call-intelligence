## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Tyler. I hate when people lie to me. Or not helpful. He probably thought it was a different person because one was Richard, one was Rick. Well, I mean, I started it off. I go, okay, how I usually do this is it goes probably in their attachments or in their resume, which on keyword version, too, it doesn't help much because you can't search attachments. It goes probably on another record. I said, what's unique about the person, such as their address, that I could keyword search and see if it's on another record? I always do the last name. I thought I might have done that. It's Kurt Rudolph, so I don't know if you ever talked to him, or it's like, you know, very long, passive-aggressive. And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that. Like, let's move on. So, yeah. I'm like, wait a minute, how did I miss that? I don't know how I missed that. I'm like flabbergasted at myself. Because I'm like, it's probably on another record. If we change the name of it, maybe add some extra spacing in there, that should change the back-end CRC number so it's not recognized as the same file. Somehow it still was, which was kind of surprising. well because but if it's like the exact same like text yeah but i thought way back when like if you go in and you modify some things or like change the name of the file then maybe i didn't edit enough i'm just like irritated that i didn't catch that because that's like what i should have found in step one I don't know why I didn't miss how I messed up but anyway thank you thank you thank you I just feel like an idiot it's a long day it's a long life so congratulations on your house when do you get to move in so we're kind of doing it there's a few things that we're doing before we move in. Like we have someone coming out tomorrow. I have to run on my lunch break. Luckily the new house is right around the corner, literally like 10 minutes away from where I live now. For painters to come do a quote. For painting the downstairs. They said they should like after the quote, they said they should be able to get in next week. and my buddy does carpet. He came and measured yesterday so we're going this weekend to pick out what carpet we want. And then we're getting a fence put in for the dog so they're coming to do a quote on that on tomorrow night to see when they can hopefully come put that in. But once the painting and carpet is done, we're hoping to be fully moved in by either like the 27th or the 4th oh that's nice nice oh i wish i was moving i need a bigger house for now when my kids are home i need a bigger house we have a lot of land i have none that's nice because i live in mayfield and it's like i'm at the last house on MI Street. So then the corner, you know. So I have like all these yards that overlook mine. And it's so annoying. So enjoy that. Because that's like, that and no bathroom space. I hope you have two baths. Yep, we do. I have one and a half. Horrible. Let me find. Here, I'll send you the Zillow link. made me happy. It finally listed as sold today. Oh, here's my scare. I'm supposed to go to the Buckeyes game Saturday, and our friend, he knows everybody down there, and he's always getting my husband tickets whenever he needs and whatever. I just read today, looking for three tickets. I'm like, wait a minute. Isn't this taken care of already? I'm going to the Penn State game. Ooh, good for you. That's awesome. My mom got a, there's six of us going. She got us some really fucking good seeds. Nice. We're in section 116A, or 16A rather. It's like the lower, it's like the lower bowl, like at like the 30 yard line. Oh, very nice. Well, my friend, my husband's friend, he would always get them like where they're on the field. and they've had some, not always on the field, but they've literally been down there doing like Carmen and with them and everything and into the tailgate things. But, I mean, he's just getting, what is he asking for? He's asking for tickets in what section? I don't even know. I'm looking for three ADEC tickets for OSU game Saturday. I don't know where ADEC is. That's like the level. oh well I would have hoped I already booked a hotel we have all these plans I don't know I think that's just how they work they do it last minute I wanted it not to be last minute it was supposed to be done like a while ago I thought oh wow you have a ton of land nice look how big the back end part too is well what's really cool like if you look at like that top view like you'll see like how it ends up like some trees back there yeah we found we didn't even notice this until after we bought it there's like a little like path like behind the the trees that goes to like a little like it's almost like a little meadow opening oh that's on our property very cool look at all those trees i don't have anything like that well it's nice so the guy to the right of us and behind us is all one family and they make maple syrup oh so all those trees are just don't park your car near them you ...
