## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. Hoping you can help me out. This is David, Santa Croce. How are you doing today? Good, good. Hey, I don't know if you guys made some sort of change yesterday, but all my notes that I've been keeping under summary are now like a big block of paragraphs versus how I've had it before. Yes, so there was a change that was made. What I can do is if you prefer the summary to be back in that old format without like that HTML bar, what I can do is submit a ticket for you to get it approved to get that change taken away for you. Okay, that'd be great because I can't even really read. Everything's just all bumbled together now. Yeah, so let me just write down your info here. So you'll get an email here in just a second saying that a ticket was open for you. And then once that is changed back for you, I will shoot you an email in that ticket and let you know. Great. How long does that usually take? it shouldn't take too too long it just has to get approval from a senior tech real quick gotcha so it should be fairly straightforward ok ok I'll put in that ticket here real quick and then let you know as soon as it's done sounds good alright thank you yep thanks have a good one bye...
