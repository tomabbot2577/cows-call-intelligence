## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you right now? Hey, so I'm using Apple for PCR, and I had problems when I first started using it. First to first was into this company about a week and a half ago, two weeks ago. And so when I click Login on Google Chrome, it just doesn't go. And I remember it was a simple fix last time, but I don't remember exactly what to do. Okay, cool. What's your name and what company are you with? So my I'm with my name is Chris and I'm with Starboard Consultants. Okay. My username would be CFP. I don't know if or you know what it would be. Morris County. Let me just send you my link. No, that's all right. I found I found the Starboard Consultants also mentioned Morris County in there, too. So, yeah, I think I'm on the right spot here in our files. Cool. So let's start by at least doing a clear cache. I'll give you instructions to do that. That may fix it. So if you go to the three dots at the top right of the browser, then look for more tools towards the bottom. Okay. And then developer tools. Okay. And that should open up some coding and stuff like that. You could just ignore all of that and then go up to your web address up at the top of the page and right-click on the refresh button, which is that arrow in a loop. Hold on. Oh, the refresh. Okay. Yeah, right-click on that. It should give you the option to empty cache and hard reload. Yeah, should I click it? Yeah, click on that. That'll slowly reload your page. and once the page does reload, you can close the developer tools. Okay, so once it all is all closed. Okay, let's see. So just reloaded. Oh, whoopsies. Hold on. Loading. Should I close it before I try logging in? Sure. Yep. Okay, let's see. Nope. Still nothing. Okay. I click login. Yeah, I click login and then just the little bubbles go up and then nothing. Let me try logging in as your username. So are you choosing a database from the dropdown at the top where it says consumer, industrial, industrial, industrial? And I've never seen industrial old. Oh, that is. Okay. That's probably just a backup they did. I just got yelled at by my boss. So, yeah, it's not industrial old. All right. I'm logged in as the admin, and that works. So let me try next to log in as your username. Yeah. And is that just Chris is your username? Username CFP. Chris represents Payload, so CFP. Okay, so I'm able to get into my end. So just something computer-specific. Let's see here. If you want to, we might want to just do a quick screen share, and then I can see your screen. So open a new tab in your browser and go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings.ring, R-I-N-G? Yep, meetings.ringcentral.com. Central, central. Oh my God, what's going on in central? Meetings.ringcentral.com. The site can't be reached. Oh, because I spelled meetings wrong. Oh, gotcha. Meetings. Meetings plural, right? Yeah, plural. Join a meeting. Excellent. And I'll give you an ID here. So the ID is 584-285-829. 584-285-829. Yep. Okay, join. Perfect. enter your name yeah it doesn't matter what you enter there it's all good Santa Claus I'm just kidding awesome if it asks about joining with audio yeah you can continue without audio since we're already on the phone allow while you're visiting a site allow while visiting that'll probably be for screen share yeah and then audio, continue without audio. Okay. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your screen that you want to share. Got it. I'd like to record this computer screen audio. Should I deny screen recording? No, I guess allow that so that it can, I think it calls it recording when you're trying to just share your screen. Okay. Wow. You can just click Google Chrome or do it on your own later. I'll do it later, whatever. Okay, that should work. Okay, Chrome tab. is what you to share with RingCentral Chrome tab window entire screen, right? Yeah, either one should work. Entire screen is probably best. You know what? I have to quit the browser and then go back. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine. I could just re-give you that meeting ID. That's totally fine. Okay, cool. So let me quit the browser. All right, hold on. Okay, let me quit. Opening it back up. And then I'm going to PC Recruiter. Log in, so I can't log in. So what was it again? The meetings, ringcentral.com, got it. And then the reading I did was? That is 584-285-829. 829. 584-285-829. Perfect. All right, now I'm back. Excellent. Continued without audio. All right, and try that blue share button again. Share entire screen. Entire screen. Share. Excellent. You know, it's interesting. I did do this the first day, too. So I'm wondering maybe Google Chrome had a update or if I had a version of Google Chrome open. Because I did have two Google Chromes as well. So maybe I'm wondering if that's what it was. Could be. So, yeah, if you just want to go to your login page in a new tab, possibly, on whichever browser you prefer. Okay, so login page in a new ta...
