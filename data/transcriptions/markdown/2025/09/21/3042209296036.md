 Hey, what's going on? It's the PCRM upgrade training for David Topping. It's a litany of issues as to why they can't use PCRM. And I don't know why they were upgraded or sold it. Because it's just like there's like seven issues as to why they can't use it. I'm waiting for... They have 60 legacy positions. This was their issue with the upgrade to the new pipeline and why they weren't doing it. They have 60 legacy positions. They may be closed to a month. And they would either have to enter 60 position records to be able to actually use PCRM with it or wait for them to all close, which they're not going to close in two years. and their pipeline reporting, they can't accurately do what they want to do in the pipeline because we don't have enough out-of-process reasons. So they've been tracking activities, and that's not so much of an issue. I can figure that one out, but there was a whole reason they didn't do it. And the AI candidate match, they need to be able to consider an internal job description and a public job description with the candidate match. And he said that's the entire reason they did it. And if that doesn't work, they are massively disappointed and wouldn't have done it to begin with because they were talking to other companies about like CRMs and ATSs. So he said, if that doesn't work, then there's no reason for them to use it. And while that is, even if we, I don't think it considers the internal job description. Even if it does, they're using the internal job description to store something specific that they're not willing to move. What are they storing there? It's some type of email template that they won't use a form letter for. I told them that we'd have to figure that out. But does the AI thing bring in the internal job description too? I am looking right now. Where are we? Okay. Blah, blah, blah. Where are you? It was just 30 minutes of them just, like, slamming me with, like, I don't know why we did this. Okay. They were nice about it, but... He said it's, like, it's... He said what it seems to be the case with PCR is every time we talk to the salesperson, it's like, oh, yeah, that sounds great. And then we get into the training and they're like, actually, well, you have to do this. You have to do this. This will only work if you do this. And there's always caveats with everything the salesperson says to them. Which is the case. That definitely is true. We know that. And it's also an 18-person office. Yeah, I mean, I've had people, I have two people right now that are larger offices that use it. I mean, the biggest thing is, if they weren't on the new pipeline, you shouldn't have sold it to them without telling them that they needed to move to the new pipeline. they knew that and I guess they agreed to it but it's not going to be reasonable like it's they either create 60 position records and still use the legacy pipeline or they use the legacy pipeline and create new positions as they close but they close to a month so like there's not a realistic situation here where they're going to be satisfied I mean, hypothetically, with the positions, we'll probably be able to do something. But let me look at one of these that's open. But they're nuts about reporting. So that is also my concern with the transition into the new pipeline. All of the reporting that they need, I truly do not feel capable to do this. I'm just very sick as the person who has to deal with them for 10 hours being the salesperson almost lying. Like I'm very sick of that. Because then I get yelled at for 10 hours. Okay. So. So I don't disagree necessarily with the internal job description being sent. However, there's no information in this. Unless it's different in some of these, I mean, I'll take a look. I didn't completely understand what they said they were using it for. I'm waiting for the RingCentral recording to load because I recorded it, but it was just 30 minutes of them slamming me, and it sucked. Like, they're not going to be happy. They are going to leave. Like, I just do not foresee this going well, and I'm, like, I really don't think I'm really going to be able to do it. So when you, so once that loads, go through it and send me what all of their like issues are and then I can look at it. Like adding an internal job description would be fine for the AI match. Does it pull into the AI match? Does it use it? It does not right this second. But that's a like relatively easy thing. or I can ask it maybe does I don't know if it's um if it's in there or not I do want to know why it also just sounds like they're doing something illegal like what do you mean because they did they were like yeah the ideal age of your candidate I'm like you there is London I don't know if that's different but no that's like extra not okay there yeah so Oh, so they want the AI match to work like a search. They want the AI candidate, the thing where it compares the job and pulls candidates for the job. They want that to consider the in...
