 Green Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Tyler, Ernie Bivona. How's it going, Ernie? Good, good. Question for you. I started the presentation on a candidate. I said, wait a minute, I'm missing some information, which I now have. So I saved the draft. Where is the draft? Where would I go to find the draft? Let me pop in and take... Was it just like an email, or were you actually using the presentation feature? Presentation. So would it be under the company? Would it be under the candidate? Where would I find under the hiring authority? Which database are you in? Industrial. It's the only one we use. You can get rid of the others. We don't use them. Let me take a look here. Let me find where those are stored here. I looked under email. I didn't see any drafts. I looked under the individual. I suppose I could look under the company.
