## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, Jim. Good morning, Drew. How are you? I'm okay. How are you? I'm not bad. I just wanted to call you, and it's been so long since we talked, and I had a question. I thought I would just call you instead of chat you. That sounds lovely. I miss seeing you. I miss seeing everybody. I see James. That's about it. Yeah, you're working at Carbons? Do they have a... Yeah, for the moment. yeah they uh they gave me a space here for for a few weeks while the kids were at school out here and then like apparently they're paying for the space for me to be here but i i told uh bill i was like i don't need to be here when school starts so if you've got an end to the deal with them you don't renew it because it's silly for me to drive out here yeah because if they're not out here anymore yeah yeah yeah and it's actually saving me money to stay home even I do like coming to the office, but I'd rather have the gas money. I think Bill was talking about maybe getting a little space somewhere. Both of you were thinking about it. They had wanted to. I think part of it was just the expense of it, trying to find a space that was affordable and yada, yada. So who knows? But I'm sort of banking on the fuel savings as an offset to the insurance. so if I can not spend 30 bucks a month on gas then I'll not spend 30 bucks a month on gas but that's always good yeah yeah how you guys doing we are all right just we were on vacation last week we were yeah we had a ball at the KOA out there oh nice it's fantastic and we did this one was a resort which is like the highest level because they have a restaurant and all these activities and pool and everything like that and they had so much like random activities going on the kids loved them like that's good we tie-dyed we ate ice cream we did cotton candy we did a duck race we did a train ride just all this crazy stuff is cool do that stuff it's fun yeah yeah we're uh we're doing um i'm trying to remember it's it's it's in mackinac city um they're mackinac mackinac i don't remember if it's mackinac or mackinac i think they're different places oh yeah um i've never been there that's all the way at the tippy top yep right northern northern michigan it's like six hours something like that but we um yeah we're doing we're staying in the cabin which will be nice because the last couple times we've been at a k away we've just taken the tent with us so but the cabin was like because it's weekdays and it's sort of the tail end of the season it was like 300 bucks to stay there for the week so that's That's good. Yeah. So we're going to be there from Monday to Thursday and we're going to, um, we're taking the dog with us. So that'll make things a little cheaper. And then we're, um, we're able to take him with us to most of the places we're going. Apparently Mackinac Island is a very, um, dog friendly place. Like there's only a couple of things we wanted to do that you can't take. They actually have a dog friendly escape room you can go to where like you're allowed to bring the dog into the escape room with you or like the person at the desk will watch your dog if you want to do it which is fun and then um there's a museum like a maritime museum and they said you you can't bring the dog into the museum but if you have two adults and you want to buy one ticket and and share it while somebody stands outside that's totally fine so i was like that's a really great policy to have they're like sure you know rather than losing both you know both sales we'd rather have your family come and buy one less ticket to split between two people you know so yeah it's a smart idea are you going up to that island where there's no cars isn't that Mackinac's island yeah Mackinac whatever it's called yeah whatever it is I can't remember but yeah so we're staying on the in the city on the opposite side and then we're going to take the ferry over to the island and go hang out there so yeah that's kind of the plan crossing my fingers that the weather is suitable. So, yeah. I've always wanted to go there. I'm interested to see how it is. Yeah, we'll find out. I will let you know. That is it. Yeah. Excellent. Well, my question, I was on just a call with someone, kind of a demo. They actually have an app, and they were looking, A, for something for their company to track their hiring and contacts, but also maybe if it works well for them, they might want to integrate it to their app or offer it as a piece of their app. They have an app for yacht brokers and yacht people and people that sell yachts and charter yachts and everything like that. So they wanted to maybe offer a hiring system as part of that eventually. Interesting. Okay. But they liked the job board and they asked me if there was a couple of good sites that I could send them to lock into to see it in action. And I didn't have any off the top of my head. And when I went to our website, we don't have any. Yeah, we don't have any jobs. And our job board was never a gre...
