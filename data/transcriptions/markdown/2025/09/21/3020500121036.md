## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Roger Hendricks. I'm sorry I missed your call, but if you leave your name and number and the purpose of your call, I'll return it as soon as possible. Thank you. Hey, Roger. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I want to thank you for returning your voicemail. I understand you're looking to eventually close your account, but first you need information on how to transfer the data to someone else. Give me a quick call. You know, when you have some time to talk, we can come over and want to make sure they have a PC Recruiter database to send it to, and then we can talk about the cancellation as well. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks very much. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye....
