## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. My name is Rick Chastain with the Chastain Group. I am trying to, I think a technological blip is happening again. I want to verify that my jobs are being scraped by LinkedIn, and I'm not getting notified when people apply now online. This has happened before, and you guys had to do something. Like you're sending your jobs from PC Recruiter to LinkedIn? Yeah, yes. And then actually also when somebody, like I've had some people apply on the 16th and on the 25th of last month, and I'm not getting notified by email that somebody has reached out. Gotcha. Let me double check your database's outgoing mail settings, because that's what controls those notifications. Yeah, I've had to fix it before. I don't know why I'd adjust it again, but life happens. So anytime you, like, say you've had to update your, like, email password, that's, yep, so that's what it's doing. It's not authenticating correctly. So that's what's causing that issue. So what you're going to do is go to System. And I email setup. Oh, yep, not a problem. System. And I'm going to have to know my email, my password, so I've got to go in and get that right. Okay, email setup, I got that. Yep, and then you'll do outgoing mail settings. Okay. And then that'll pop open that box, and what you'll want to do is that sign in with Microsoft option. I click that. And it should prompt you to go through and sign in with Microsoft, or if a cookie is already stored, you might just get taken back to that screen right away. Okay, it said save successful. All right, now let me test the connection here. Yep, and so if you hit test connection, you should see where it says status in green and then test completed. That means it's authenticated correctly now. So you can exit out of that test connection box and then hit save. Yep. Okay. So that'll fix those notifications coming in. Okay. Now, can you see if it's being the jobs that are posted on the website are actually being scraped and sent out? That one I would have to put in a ticket for our webmaster, Drew, who is on vacation this week, for him to check when he gets back next week. Okay. Because he's the only one that has access to that kind of stuff. Okay. No. Is it like through an, is it just like a feed that it's getting scraped or? Yes, it's a, I think it's a feed. I really don't know. I know that we, it just is, it's being, whenever we change a job posting, it goes to, let me verify this on the Chastain Group. It goes to the Chastain Group website, and then also that LinkedIn picks it up. Okay. Now, is that something that you have set up through your website then? Because normally the only way we were able to push positions to LinkedIn from PC Recruiter is you would have to go through the position record in PC Recruiter itself, and then... I believe it's directly from PC Recruiter. Okay. So when those positions are being posted, you have... Someone's going in and actually doing that... We do it on PCR. We do it on PCR. And once we do it on PCR, it immediately transfers to the Chastain Group, which is doing so. I can look at it and see. Yeah. Yep, go to the website. But it also is being shared with LinkedIn, and I didn't know if LinkedIn scraped or if there was a feed. I don't know. Okay. Technologically-wise, that's beyond my scope. Okay. Yeah, I'll put in a ticket for you. Okay. All right. So jobs, posting. and then I'll assign it over to Drew and he can take a look when he gets back from vacation and he can reach out to you alright thank you not a problem have a great day ok bye...
