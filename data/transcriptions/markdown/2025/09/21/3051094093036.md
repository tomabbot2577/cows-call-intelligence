## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello. Hey, Robin. Yes. Hi, this is Bill Hayes. Okay, I figured you'd know the number by now. Yeah, it took me that long for my system to reboot and go through its whole process again and blah, blah, blah. Anyway, so I went back to the original email you sent me on Outlook to the link to click on it to see if it made a difference, and it did not. it said the same thing that this site is unreachable okay um and by the way while you and i were on the phone tyler was calling me back as well i guess he got must have picked up the message as well well here's what happened the ticket actually assigned to tyler and i didn't have my filter my name off i accidentally grabbed it oh okay that's fine i point you'll be aware of that but you probably knew that yeah um let me hold that one second okay all right Okay, so I'll probably have to do... okay so let's i'm not really sure this would be done okay let's try and you have restarted like your modem and router and all that kind of good stuff right you said you already did that after your other connection issues? Yeah, this morning, I mean, it restarted itself. I mean, it came, you know, I didn't have to do anything. I just had to wait for the connection to take place again via the streaming, you know, service, and then it did that. So, yeah, I mean, I'm getting, I mean, I could click on, I could click on the LinkedIn bookmark and it goes right there. I might have any problems with that. yeah we got a little bit more going on though they may okay let's have you rejoin that meeting okay you want me to go back to that old email or you have to send a new no I think this is the last one I have up so I think we should be good let me go back to that meeting now yeah just hit the join call button again okay trust us trust sender I guess I should Click that. Maybe that's why it wasn't going through. I don't know. Some content as messages has been blocked because the sender isn't in your safe senders list. So maybe that's why it wasn't. I hit trust sender, and now I hit join call. Maybe that was why you weren't getting it. I think I'm going to write one. Okay. I wonder if I am now. I'm going to resend you a link. It's loading. it's loading something up here now. I don't know if you're not... Am I in the same one, though? I had one that was just in. I assume it's yours. Yeah. It says you're getting ready. You'll be able to join in just a moment. We did the camera thing again. All right. Ask to join. Yeah, click that. I think it's the same meeting. Okay, let's turn off microphone for some reason to turn that on. Ready to join, ask to join. Oh, we'll see if I'm going to be in a meeting with you, right? There it goes. Okay. All right. So, yes, we're on the phone, so you can mute your microphone. And then let's have you click share screen. Okay, where is that at? Down at the bottom of the meeting screen. Mm-hmm. So square, like a rectangle with an arrow in it. Oh, there you go. And then you should be popping up a window. It says presentation is starting. There you go. Are you talking? Your mic is off. Click the mic. You said I don't need to turn the mic on? No, you don't need that on. Right. Oh. Okay. Oh, now there's something I wanted to mention to you. I heard something about Google doing some update and moving things into tabs, and I don't really know what that means, but could that maybe be the cause of why it was banned? I'm not sure what you're referring to. I just saw somebody else say on one of the forums that they weren't able to get into a certain place and it turns out Google had moved it to some sort of tab. I don't know. I'd just bring that up if that's... I have no idea what that's referring to. Nothing that you've heard. Okay. Are you talking about that automatic tab discarding feature? Yeah. I mean, again, I'm not 100% sure what that means either. It was just something came up today from some other thing I was reading, and they couldn't get into a site, and it turns out that their bookmark had been moved somewhere. Oh, no. I don't know about that. That just seems like bad saving. So it says here, choose what to share with me. The site will be able to see the content. Do I need to click on something? You need to go to entire screen. Okay. And then click on the screen to show. Click, just click on the, I don't know, to share. What am I doing here? Clicking on this. I hit entire screen. Now, am I supposed to be doing? So you got to click on the screen to show and then hit share. On the screen to show. I'm not seeing that part. So when you clicked on share screen, it popped up a window, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. And you go over to entire screen. Choose what to share. Right. I hit entire screen. and it'll show you like a preview of your monitor and if you have more than one it shows you each one i only have one monitor okay so you click on that monitor and then hit shot it there you go okay sorry i'm a little challenged here um let's do this go to see at the bottom right by yo...
