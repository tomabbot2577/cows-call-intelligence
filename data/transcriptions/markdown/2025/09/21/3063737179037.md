## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, my name is Hannah. I'm an account manager with the Ohio Labor Law Poster Service. Calling on a recorded line. I need to speak to the person that handles your labor law compliance, please. Okay. Let me try transferring you to my supervisor. One second. Thank you. Okay, yeah, he doesn't seem like he's available right now. He might already be on a call. Let me transfer you to his voicemail. He still is probably the best person to talk to. So his name's Nick. He's my supervisor, and I'll just send you to the voicemail. Okay, thank you. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. You too....
