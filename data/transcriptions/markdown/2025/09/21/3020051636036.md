 Hello? Hello? hello can you hear me I can hear you can you hear me yes hi this is Stacy calling from Connecticut oh hi Stacy how are you I couldn't hear you at first I wasn't sure if you could hear me and yeah I was just like oh well um I'll wait till I hear something you know what I mean like the music and then it was just like silence and I was like I don't know if anybody actually answered the phone or not so yeah it sounded like I heard some background stuff but couldn't hear your voice at least. What's going on? Okay. So I've been trying to get a hold of Mackenzie or Nick. Sent them several emails, sent them left messages. Like, you know, we're using, we're trying to use the new PCRM. I have questions about that. We've done some integration with Zoom, and I need to talk to somebody about how can I map, like, PCR Zoom when I'm trying to update a candidate. And it's not, I've mapped it where, you know, if I'm importing from Zoom, like, I've mapped it that way. But when I go to click on a candidate or whatever, the field, that's where I need to map it. And they said it's within PCR. So, So I don't know who the best person I need to speak to about this. Now, where are you starting from? Let me ask you this. In the Zoom thing? Yeah. Like, are you starting from Zoom site and then mapping over to, like, exporting to a piece of Twitter? No, I've already mapped that angle. It's when I'm in a candidate's record, okay? Okay. And then I can click on, you know, the little Zoom thing, and then, you know, the field. Is that the update with Zoom info option? Right. Right. Okay. Okay, so that, I don't think we do probably as much as if you were to start from Zoom. I think they make a lot of custom fields. Really, I believe what you're doing. Well, what I've done is in PCR, so I didn't want it to override the data that we already have. okay just to make sure you know what I mean um and so when you click on the zoom like update okay so I have created custom fields in every button you know in the candidate thing it says zoom cell zoom personal email business phone and zoom you know uh business phone business email so if I click on zoom and then um I go to update a candidate okay um and then it says you know here's the field. It's the field email address. So it has like email address, homework, hotmail, AOL, pager, broadcast. It's not giving me the field options that I created for this. Let's see. I might have to do a screen share with you because I don't have a Zoom account. Let me see. Okay. I can't even see what it does. I don't go into it really too much myself because I don't have a Zoom account. And I know it's kind of like, I don't remember if that one's customizable. So you have to have a thing. Update with Zoom. I can't even log in. Can we do a screen share? Because I don't know if that was one. Because they're two separate things. They're not the same program. Like if you start with Zoom, it's basically what they wrote. But if you're coming from us, it's based on what we wrote. Ours, I don't think is customizable. so you may not have as many like you may not have the same options as if you were starting from Zoom okay yeah I'm just trying to figure out like it might just be like some basic yeah it might be some basic fields but I don't really remember to be honest let me see if my documentation at least gives me some screenshots maybe so that I don't sound completely stupid and we can screen share if you want i mean i can show you what i'm looking at see this okay enhance the zoom info that's whenever it's in panel will appear okay enter credentials you're going to choose a company because i feel like it's basically almost the same thing as capture if i remember right on the screen i don't remember if there's any kind of configuration change image yeah I don't think there's I think it's just a certain list um because you're really just supposed to be kind of updating like pulling so might be better to start from zoom info to have more flexibility let's do a screenshot I forget do you have ring central yeah okay so I'll do it I'll set up the meeting that way okay okay video start okay so if you can go to video and select join in your ring central app i'll give you a meeting id just uh when you do join we don't obviously don't need your camera but don't choose to join with audio either since we're on the phone. Otherwise, we sometimes get a lot of background noise. Look at Echo. Okay. So, hold on. I have my RingCentral desktop, so I might have to bring up the other one. Yeah, because I don't see any details listed here about customizing it. Let's see. Okay. Change image, first name, last name, title, address, email, phone, social. I think that's really all it's supposed to do. If you choose an email field, if you leave it as undefined. Okay, for email field, you have to choose an email field. For a phone number, you have to choose a phone field. I'm trying to even get the right sample right now. Yeah for what I se...
