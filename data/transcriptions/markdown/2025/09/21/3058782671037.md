## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hi, Tyler. This is Greg Hunt. Garrett's been helping me with a problem I've been having with time zones and sequencing. Yes. Want me to see if he's available for you? Thank you. Yeah, that'd be great. Give me two seconds. All right. It looks like he is currently on the other line. What I could do is transfer you to his voicemail, and he'd give you a call back as soon as he's off the phone. Thank you. Does he have a direct dial so I don't have to go through the main system? He's my guy. Yes. I'll write that down. Thank you. Let me see if I have his extension here. His extension is 5427. So what would I direct dial, or do I just, when I hear the recording and the music, I dial 5-4-2-7? As soon as you hear the music and the recording, just dial that number. 5-4-2-7. Okay, I'll hold for his voicemail. Thank you. Transferring you in 3-2-1. Thank you, sir....
