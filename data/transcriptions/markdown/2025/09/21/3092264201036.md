## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, it's Heidi. Hi, Heidi. It's Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Hello, Robin. How are you, the original wonderful person you are? Original, that's for sure. Try to be wonderful. Trying. You're the brain trust girl. Oh, I don't know about that one anymore, but I try. It's hard to keep up anymore. I hear you. So I wanted to see if we could do a screen share so you could show me what's going on. Sure. Okay. Do you have RingCentral or do you prefer Google Me? RingCentral, like, always starts up when I start up my computer, so I have it. Okay. Because sometimes if I have to take over screen, like, remote, or if I have to take over the mouse, then that one's better. Absolutely. If somebody has it. Okay. So let me make sure. Wait. Which? I'm just going to put my headset on. Hang on for a second. Yeah. Well, you won't need it since we're on the phone. Okay. There we go. Never mind. I just switched over to my headset so I can hear you better. Okay. Bear with me one second because I apparently closed my window I need to be in. I got your email address. I just had you up here. maybe I had your company up there it is okay and what email address should I send the invite to actually you know what I don't even need to if you open up your app sorry I'm having a I'm having a lack of a brain moment here okay so if you open up that break central all in one app. You go to video and then join. Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So what's the URL for that? Because I don't have it as a shortcut or anything. Oh, you don't have the app installed? You know, listen, you're the OG person and I don't have any apps. It fires up every time. So I know that if when I go to what ringcentral.com or whatever it is, is that what it is? So if you have the app, if you go to like, are you on Windows computer? Yeah. Okay. Type the word ring. And then under best match, do you see ring central app? Oh, yeah, there it is. Well, you know, okay. Here we go. This is where I always go into it. I don't know. Okay. So once that opens, go to video. Or join a meeting. Yeah, you can do that. and let me know when you're ready for the meeting ID. Enter meeting ID. 050-394-810. And I'm going to not use computer audio since you're already on the phone. Okay, yeah, that's better. And we don't need a camera. Yeah. Okay, so you're in. Okay, at the bottom of your meeting screen, click share. And then make sure you go over to entire screen. Okay, wait a minute. So I just joined without computer audio. Okay. And share your entire screen. Gotcha. And share. Okay. You are sharing. All right. I can see you. Let's go over and have you open up Chrome and go to either, you know, like show me what's going on first. Okay. Okay. So let me just. Oops, why is that? How do I get this to minimize a little bit? Because I have the folders open on the top, But it says you are sharing, and I'm like, I can't see my. Oh, is it the toolbar? Yeah, that toolbar is up there. Oh, I forgot now because I can't see it. Okay, let me see. Can you hover it in the, like, hide toolbar or, like, in the options at the very top? Does it show anything? Yeah, I'm just kind of clicking on it. Let me see. Or you usually should be able to, like, just slide it away. Yeah, that's a good idea. Let me try that. Oh, yeah. I can just move it. Okay. So here, like, let's say this guy, this is a list. I'm trying to go. We just had somebody turned out an offer. So I'm going back to the pipeline. Okay. So here I'm in the job pipeline. So I click on the guy here. and so and this is somebody that I put in then I go over here to LinkedIn and I click on him and then LinkedIn comes up but it doesn't go right to the person so it's giving me see how it's giving me the drop down list of these people that might mean that you don't have the URL saved here's my recommendation do you have the ability to customize your name layout I don't know it's always worked before when I've added them in you know using that little option on the right hand side you know when you when you put them in can you go back to um the main page okay um let's do this at the top right of your name layout go to that three line of your name record go to that three-lined icon i never use that toolbar to be honest go to options let's see if you have customized click on customize um yeah it's that gear icon right above where you are oh yeah there it is okay okay here's what i personally like to do um if you scroll down in your group okay see at the bottom there where it says click to set field click there start typing the word linkedin and you should see an option called social underscore linkedin i find this is much easier to use okay select that gotcha and it's not pinned but if you go to the three-lined icon at the very top you'll find save in that menu.
