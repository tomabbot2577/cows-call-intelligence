So, I'm actually just writing an email to somebody else about Ring Central setup. So, here, I'm going to send you the instructions because there's some setup that you're going to have to do for him. And then, really, all he needs to do is just authenticate. Or do you want me to talk you through that? Yeah, you can. I guess if I got me on the phone, if I have to do something, what do I got to do, Robin? So, he's already got the app downloaded, though? Yeah, he does. He uses it every day.

And then next to the phone number field. Do you have his direct number in there? I don't know if I do or not, Robin. It's his old number. No, I don't. No, I don't. Let me see here. Make sure you put that in there because if you ever want to do anything more like opting in and out of text messages, that's the number. It'll try to merge in. How do I edit that? Anyway, Robin, where do I do that at? I don't have an option. It's to click his name. Oh, it's down here at the bottom. Contact information, security, and other information. Yeah. So right below full name. Put his RingCentral direct number there. that's just one part of it. Okay. I have to look it up I don't have it. Let me see I might be able to log into RingCentral real quick Robin right?
