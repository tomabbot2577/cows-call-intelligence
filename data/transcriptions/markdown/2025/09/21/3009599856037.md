You probably want to mute yourself because sometimes it causes some feedback since we're already on the phone. Mic's off. Camera's off. All I get is your picture. All right. Perfect. Okay, so at the bottom middle of your meeting screen, you should see an option that says share screen. It's a square with an arrow. Click on that. And then go over to entire screen. Okay. Did that. And then click on, I don't know if you have one or two monitors. Perfect. Okay. All right. Let's see. Okay, so let's go up to a new tab. Don't close this window because it'll kick you out of the meeting, but see how you can open up a new tab. Let's just go over to a new tab. okay um let's see see that extensions icon it's that black looking puzzle piece this one uh no up that's that's what they call the waffle no over to the left a little bit right after the star of the url one more over to the left nope right over to the right down here No, it's going to be over at the top right. Top right. Okay, it looks kind of like a puzzle piece. It's two spots over to the left. This thing. Yeah, click on that. Let's see what we've got there. Okay, hit the push pin. Okay, all right. So now we've got the extension. So you added it, but they don't pin them by default, so that's why I had you pin it. Okay, so click, go over to your PCR login page. Because we're going to have to connect this to your database. Oh, wait a minute. What did I just do? Hover on your Google option there down at the bottom. You're still in a meeting. Okay, go to that last tab, that last pop-up. Okay. So click your shortcuts. Yeah, click that. Copy that URL that you see up at the top. Yeah. Oh, I did all this stuff. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now click on the extension, which is that black, or I'm sorry, which is like the purple, green, and blue little hexagon. Purple, green. Yeah. Right before that extensions icon, I had you go in before. Remember we had to pin it? So now it's pinned. This one? Yep, click on that. Okay. And put it in there. Yeah, paste that on there. Hit login. Okay, put in your PCR username and password. How long we have this girl's cat a long time ago Wasn't your username just T. Mitchell T. Mitchell Yeah I think that's what it was I know it's not a dot You have to pick your database Which is right above Right above where you are Yeah, you have to go to patient one. Okay, pick TMA. Try that. Hit login. All right, now when you are capturing, do you want people to go to the default company, or do you want to try to get the company off their profile? Company off the profile, then I'll have to fix it. All right, so see where it says capture to default company? You're going to, at the very bottom right of the pop-up window, turn that option off. Yeah, so just toggle that slider. Just click to the left of where it would have a gray circle. Just click. No. They're not clicking. Okay, just click on that. So turn it off. It's not clicking anywhere. Not budging. Why is it not moving for you? See if those guys move. Nope. Career builder doesn't budge. None of them. Okay. Let's exit this capture window for a moment then. Maybe it should be full screen. Okay. Let's close this tab, and then we'll come back up. Let's just close the tab completely. Up on top here? Yeah. Okay. Let's open up a new tab. Okay, go back to the extension. That was kind of weird. It all locked up there for you. So just to the left of it. This? No, exit out of this pop-up. So this would be like all your extensions if you had more than PCR capture. So the actual extension is right there. Okay, now try toggling. There we go. Oh, it looks like you're Corral Builder 1.
