## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. This is Mackenzie. How are you? What's up? I'm doing well. How can I support you? Well, so one of my associates at my company has been working with one of your associates at your company. I believe his name is Garrett. I'm not sure if you're able to get me to Garrett or if I have to kind of like start over the process if he is. So basically what's happening is my work email is connected to my PCR, but when I'm in my work email, like under the Gmail format, when I go to send emails, I'm not able to see any of the emails that I've sent in PCR. I'm only able to see the emails that I've sent underneath when I'm in the Gmail tab underneath my work email. So I'm trying to figure out how I can connect those two. So when I like send out contracts and things like that to our clients, I'm still able to see those in my sent email and I can put them in specific folders so I can keep track of all that information. Very well said, Mackenzie. Give me one second to pull up your account, if that's okay. I need to see like settings you have in place to see how to go about doing that. So what company are you with? Again, Mackenzie, you didn't mention it. I'm with Moraine Group, but we do have multiple mergers. So I'm not sure which merger company name is under y'all. what's the last name? What's your last name? If you don't mind. I think housing super German, but it's F as in Frank. I as an igloo and as a Nancy K as in kite, spell the house, like the house you live in at home and then put it in as a Nancy at the end. Okay. Um, probably just the first four letters should be good enough. And I don't see you in our system. Have you ever called before? No, I haven't. Not with this company. Okay, yeah, I don't see you in here. Okay. So the person that spoke to your associate, his name is Tom Henderson. So maybe you can pull that call with him and see what the notes look like. Sure. Yeah, my goal is to find out the URL you use to log in. But you said Moraine Group, which I know that. Does it say, when you log into PCR, does the URL bar say at the end F underscore MR San Diego? Or does it say MR Rockland County? The first one. MR San Diego. Okay, okay. um all right um then there's like a bunch of databases in the drop down on the login screen which one are you using to log in or tom or whoever oh you might have said that i just use i use the san diego one that's what my login is like that's the database i use is the mr san diego right uh but then like on the login screen there's a drop down where you choose like which database and I don't see a Sandy. Oh, MR San Diego upload. Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. And then the username that you use or the person with the issue. It's just McKenzie and all caps. I'm sorry. Minus the a, my parents just did McKenzie. Okay. Not Mackenzie, but it's funny. There's a lot of different spellings for that name. Yeah. I am Mack. They call me Mack. They call you Big Mack? That's what they called me on my soccer team. Oh, my God. Any combination. Any word with Mack. Yep, I've heard it. Yep. Yep, we go by all other things. Mackenzie, Mackenzie, all the things. All right. So let's see. I'm looking at your email. You said there's okay. Yeah. So when you expand the folder list, there's two. Correct. There's personal and Gmail McKenzie. Yeah, I guess. I don't see the back end like you do because I'm not an admin. In my old company, I used to be an admin so I could see all the back end things, but I can't on this end of my screen. um but what i'm assuming is what happened is that the folder in my gmail is labeled as sent and a folder in pcr is labeled as sent mail i don't think they're connecting um based on potentially name differentiation or potentiality of how it's pulling on the back end from those folders it says it's connected in pcr like it says it's like my sent mail is supposed to be going to my sent mail on my Gmail, but it says sent mail instead of sent, which is what it says, like when I actually log into Gmail. So I think there might be some backend coding miscommunication. Okay. Well, let me take a look. Um, cause I would actually probably be one of the people that Garrett needs help from to fix this. So, um, I'm, I'm looking at this and I just, I'm going to have a couple questions. Let me verify one thing. That's fine. And the only reason I even know all of this is because I've worked with PCR for the last three years. I've been with a couple of different companies, but we've always utilized PCR. So I've always been an admin and was able to kind of fix these things, but I'm not really able to do that on my end right now. I see. Okay. Okay. All right. So yeah, I have a clarifying question. And I think I know the answer. I just need to hear like, you say it. Yeah. Could you walk me through how you send like you're saying you part of what you said? Let me look at my notes. when i go yeah all right...
