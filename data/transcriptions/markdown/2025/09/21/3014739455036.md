## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. My name is Lori Hollingsworth. I'm with FloraSearch. Excuse me. And I was calling. I have a question for you guys. Martin Zara from our office wanted me to call and ask you a question. OK. What's the question? um he was wondering if we had rest api i have no idea what that is i was wondering when you say when you say okay you guys um um okay so recently uh we went through a change where i don't believe you needed that I don't think you need that anymore, and we have, like, a default. I don't think you need to pay for that service anymore. Let me get the thing that just means. Sorry, one second. Let me pull it up. It's been a few months since this change. I'm just trying to find, like, the actual. yeah because I don't know what it is but he's at a trade show and wanted me to find out the information oh actually it might be might be conflating two different things we we do have api like yes we do have an api there's api documentation you can connect like via pc recruiter via api there's many like api based integrations with pc recruiter so in in the general sense of like does pc recruiter use api and have an available API? The answer is yes. But I think I was conflating what you asked me with something that happened recently where people would call and ask if they needed a specific username and password. He was wondering about a token, bearer token. A bearer token? Okay, yeah, okay. You are asking what I thought. Okay, cool, cool, cool. So I don't think you actually need any specific we used to okay so as far as i know there was a pro or there was like a system that we would pay for um to get analytics on our api users and that that analytics service like wasn't giving us what we really needed out of it um so that was the service that like would need the bearer token. So since we don't have that anymore, I believe we do not need it. Let me double check. Let me just make sure if somebody... I wish I knew more about it. Yeah, it's like a long, it's a lot to learn. And there's a bit of a learning curve to just supporting softwares and working within them a lot and using the API. API is just a technical term for just communicating with the software in, like, the back end instead of having, like, PC Recruiter, like, in the front end where you, like, have a username and login and there's buttons to click, right? You could code, you could code basically, like, a string of, like, commands and, like, send data straight to the database with just, like, a command, like through the back end and that would be like you connect to the api and do that that's kind of how so there's integrations between softwares where you kind of they just communicate via the back end and you know transfer data back and forth and it looks inside you can see it inside pcr you know as a user uh so yeah we have api and i i'm just making sure let me sorry i'm trying to explain and also type a message i'm going to have to pause now go ahead and that's okay Thank you. Thank you. I'm just muted for a second. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I found some instructions on how to set up an API username inside PCRecruiter and then get the database ID. However, you said the word bearer token and I don't see the word bearer token in these. I did find what I was talking about, though. The API key and app ID are things that we no longer need. So maybe Barotoken is something you need, and then I maybe can help you achieve that. But I believe, yeah. So if there's like an app or something in the API, if you're using our API and they're asking for an API key, an app ID, you can just put in the very generic value of API key or APPID for those two values. So maybe bearer token is something you need. I might have misspoke earlier. I might have been, sorry, conflating the two things in haste. I apologize for that. Does that make sense? Sorry to kind of backpedal there. um so we i don't know you were yeah i don't know you were typing i don't know if you like reiterated what i said somewhere else need to change that but um so i'm trying to figure i'm trying to find out um for you you're looking for specifically a bearer token is that correct Well, yeah, he was, yeah, he said that. Let's see. I mean, if you go into the web, whatever it's called, where you can find out about stuff. The Learning Center? Yeah. It has this API thing. Let's see here. Yeah, maybe. That's a great. Use an endpoint called access token to generate a session. Let's see if I can print this again. Use the bearer token. Required parameters. Bearer token. Oh, I think I found it. Okay. You said you were on the Learning Center. Can you go to search API and then there's an actual, it says the documentation for the REST API can be found at, and then there's a URL that says API docs underscore V2 at the end of it? Quick start guide. Quick start guide. Mine just says welcome to PCRAPI docs. Perfect...
