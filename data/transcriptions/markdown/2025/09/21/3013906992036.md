## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. Good morning. It's Mike McLean with META. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Hey, I was going through the email about upgrading our database to the Lucian. Okay, yeah. Yeah, so just a couple questions. So with that upgrade, that's all done in the background, right? You said it could take up to about 24 hours or so? Right, so we'll have our tech team switch over to Lucene, and then the 24-hour time block would be for the re-indexing of your database to kind of match the Lucene tools. Oh, okay. But that wouldn't affect any of our users in working in the database while they upgrade to the – how do you pronounce it? Lucene? Lucene. Lucene. Lucene. Yeah. It would not function, like the quick search at the top right of PCR would not function while the re-indexing is going on. But you could still use basic search on the left. It's just that quick search bar up at the top will really be functioning during re-indexing. Okay. Could we re-index? So we start to re-index towards the end of the day so that by morning it should be good to go? Yeah, maybe I'll put a note in there. Or like on a Friday if it's during the week. I just don't want to affect any of the users. That makes sense. Yeah, I'll add an end note for our tech team. The preference there, that's a good idea. Okay. And then, yeah, you'd mentioned that the management hasn't decided yet as to what they were going to do, like if it's going to be part of our package or is it going to be additional? Oh, for the, at least just for the trial. We don't know a timeframe of the trial, but they are currently, every customer has the three basic AI tools. And then by request, we can get the Lucene upgrade and the AI search. Those will all be free of cost. And it's just, yeah, the timeframe they haven't really shared with us how long the trial goes for. Okay, but they're not looking at charging extra for these features. It's just the... They would, yeah, they would charge extra for these features after the free trial is over. And you would just need to talk to your account rep, Jim Lombardo, to say, yes, I do want to actually keep these or get them installed permanently onto my databases for the charge. But we won't automatically charge you or anything. It's not one of those free trials where you forget that you signed up and then you start getting charged. We'll turn it off from your account if you haven't reached out saying that you want to get charged. Yeah. Well, no, and I'm just, I guess I'm just questioning. So if there's something that's going to be additional charges, is why are you allowing all the users to try them out? And then basically after the trial, you're going to be like, no, you're not paying for them, you're taking them all away. So we already pay for, especially like the database itself, like we already have, you know, pay per user. So how does that roll out that, you know, you're going to allow features and then pull them back again? It's kind of more just, yeah, like the free trial idea where you could try it, see if you're interested, see if this is something you would like before purchasing it instead of not being able to experience it and then putting in the money to purchase it. So you get like a test of it, taste of it first so that you know if it's something you actually do want to buy. And again, I don't know, you guys, how you re-rolled it out. Any other platform that we have, If there's a trial that's going to be a paid feature to add on later, it's something that we have to request to add. So it wouldn't just be something. So like all those three features that are currently in the database that all the users can access right now, any other platform that we have that's online, they would only enroll that out if we, kind of like the search feature. We have to come to you guys and say, hey, we want to try this free trial out, blah, blah, blah. The only reason, Garrett, I'm bringing it up is because if we have users that use it and they're like, oh yeah, this is a great feature, but now it's additional cost and it's a little bit out of our financial realm. Now these users have already experienced it, touched it, tried it, and now you pull away the features again after. So that's my only tidbit there on that. Any other platform, like I said, we've had to reach out to them and say, hey, can you add these features for us to try for a month or whatever it is? and then, okay, they add the features. Just because I didn't even realize that this was part of the database, one of our users had already started playing around with it. And they said, hey, have you seen this? I just wanted to touch base. And I didn't even know that it was part of PCR, to be honest. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, I will reach out to Jim, though, and see what kind of costs are involved in adding. So it's all the features they're going to charge for, like not jus...
