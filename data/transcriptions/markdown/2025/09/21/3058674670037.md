Yeah, you could put in that person.  Okay.  Then what do I do? But if I go to that person's name and then want to see the people that they have referred to me, there's no connection there, right? so you could set up an association or you can always run a search based on that referrer field okay okay then that's what i'll do that's what i needed to know because we had software many years ago and you could like click on that and then it would bring up that person and show everyone that they referred but instead what i do is a search for that person for refer that person's name and refer, right?
