 yes hi Bob love it hey Bob hello it's Kenzie from calling back hi I found it um okay let me log in hang on one second I was gonna say we were close we were so close we were that's funny okay hold on let me just log back in okay I don't know yeah just to say before we get there. I'm not sure you could add your own custom one, but there are a list of 15 or so that you can turn on and off. I found the screen where you turn them on and off. Okay. So it would be when you go to a name, you go to the configure... I think it's actually customize gear menu. Yeah, it's called customize. Yeah. And then on that screen where we were looking at it before... Sure. Go ahead. And then in the top right corner of this screen, there's an action menu. And inside that action menu, there's configure status, which is an action, which is like a looks like a tag. Yes, I see it. And then that little window configure status is where you can check on or off the statuses that you see in that drop down. So it's just I can't add to it. I can just select out of that. OK. Right. So that's the you have the predefined status field, which is the word predefined is kind of weird. It's kind of confusing, but it's it's just kind of means like it's defaulted into like the structure of the database. And a custom field is stored in like a different table. And that's something you'd like create yourself as a user. You can create custom fields. Right. So since you have the predefined status field, those are just the statuses that are like out of the box in PC Recruiter. So those are the ones we have. And we just gave you the option to check them on or off. If you wanted to, it might be kind of like a big setup for like a payoff later where you can, I guess you could make that you did have a custom field name status. You can make the list of default values that you wanted there. And then you'd have to kind of migrate that into your layouts. And then you'd have to make sure every user like did the same so that you're all using the same field. And then you could kind of go from there and like start using the custom field from there. You'd want to if you did that, you'd want to like backfill the data from the predefined field to the custom field, which I believe is. Which is possible, I believe that's possible to do. All right. So I just collected from that configure status. It's kind of how you want to do it. But to answer your question directly, this is the screen. And I don't know if you're going to have more questions. I was kind of answering questions you might have later, I guess, already. No, no, no. That's perfect. That's perfect. I appreciate your thought, getting the answer and getting back to me. I'll just have to work with what my choices are on that. That's it. Yeah. And if you do need assistance. You know what it is? And there's a bunch of people that I'm going to be working with that own their own companies. So because they're all different companies, oh, wait a minute. You know what? Maybe I could just create a roll-up list. Because what I'm looking for, let's say there's a new concept I'm going to be implementing as part of my offering. I'm going to become an AI talent partner, meaning I'm going to help companies implement their AI solutions. Not just make placements. Got it. So I'm getting introduced to people that I have the same idea nationally. And I wanted to tag all of those people. So when I want to just reach out to the group, I've got the group. And I was hoping to add a status called AI Talent Partner People. But you know what? I don't need to do it under this status. I'll just create a roll-up list and add them to that roll-up list. You could do that. the status field... Is there a different way to do it? Yeah, you could do a couple ways. I mean, PCR is very customizable, so there's many ways to do many things. How would you do that? Well, the roll-up does make sense if you're just like, as you get them, you can put them on this roll-up list, and they're kind of sectioned off on a roll-up. You can get them all easily. That's like a... Roll-ups are a nice way to just gather records of a certain whatever, however you really want to gather them for whatever reasons. So that is a good solution. But you could also, it sounds like you were trying to change the status field. And maybe I think maybe just making a new custom field might be just a better option because the status field has its own uses and stuff. Some of those statuses have certain functions work differently. For example, if you turn a name record to manager or employee, um there's like things on the back end that allow them to like log into like the um like employer portal which is like an old an old thing that you need to be like used you know so it's like the status kind of has code surrounding it already so it might make more sense just to make like a new a new custom field if you wanted to actually have a marker on the name record itself uh you could have a new cus...
