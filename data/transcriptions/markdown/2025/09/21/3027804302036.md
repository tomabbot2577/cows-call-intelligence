I'm not telling if it went through yet or not. I'm also going to send you an invitation to this billing portal right now. And it goes to G. Garner at the Garner Group. Okay. What you can do is in that billing portal, I don't know if you ever, like, you know, when we were in our old system, you always had to like call us up if your card ever changed or things like that okay so okay i'm not on my computer right now i'm yeah with a new billing portal like what you can do is you click sign up you create an account it's just for billing okay use a pcr password but then like i can't go in and delete your original card but you could go under the vault and um from there you could like always change your card um you know delete a card if it's you know you know you're never going to use it anymore. Okay. Did this one go through for you? I'm still waiting for confirmation one way or the other. I'm thinking that it did not. All right. Why don't you go in there and add the other one then. Okay. Yeah, this declined too. Unless I entered something wrong. No, whatever. It's a whole thing. Let me go in there and just add. Yeah. know why but okay let me go in i'll i'll do that i'll fix that and if it doesn't now in the vault area i believe if you have auto pay turned on for a car you have to turn the auto pay off for the card before you can delete it from what i thought okay okay you probably just want to turn that off for that card and then try deleting it and then you could okay okay all right all right let me know if you run into any issues yeah no i mean i'll do that right now i just had to move locations um Okay, let me try to do that right now and figure that out and call American Express.
