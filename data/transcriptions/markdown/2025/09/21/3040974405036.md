## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. Sequin, this is Robin. Well, hey, Ms. Robin. It's Tom Zeleny. Hi, how are you? I am weary. I went to a concert last night. Oh, my gosh. I'm getting too old with this shit. But it was a fabulous concert, and I got to meet the band members, and they signed my merch. And they were great young kids, and I can say that because they were like the age of our youngest son. So I felt like the old man there. But it was fun. So anyway, I didn't get home until like 1.30 this morning, which made for a really early wake up at 5.30. And my ears are still ringing. But anyway, that aside, business as usual. So I had a couple of quick questions for you, one of which is when I am adding a position to a company, It used to be the PCR would just take whatever the last number of the position was and assign the next number in sequence. And it doesn't do that anymore. So now it just assigns whatever the last number was, and I have to go manually in and update it. And I was wondering if – I wonder if you got something off. Like you might have adjusted one, and then it kind of threw off your automatic numbering. Do you know what number you want it to be next? well I just added what should be 1185 and it added it as 1184 so then I went in manually and overwrote it made it 1185 but if I ask going to be 1186 right correct correct let's do this let's have you go to system okay users all right and then go to uh manage users yeah click on your username okay and then click preferences all right all right under where is it gonna be listed gosh I have so many why do I have so many windows open Tom I know I do the same under somewhere there's like a use simple numbering option and then it's a hyperlink and it says set seed ID do you see that I have to go with section center I have to actually log in. Yes, I see. Okay. I see it. Click where it says set seed ID. And that's how the numbering is used whenever anybody's. Now, if you have other users, it'll pick up the same numbering. You might need to adjust whatever positions it's currently set to. So if I click on use simple numbering for records, and I click on that, it says starting ID numbers. And I have candidates, positions, and companies. Yeah. So what's your next one for positions? It's 1184. Okay, so that's what you've got to bump up. Okay, so make that 1185 and save. Yeah, do you want your next one to be 1185? Yes. Okay, yeah. Wait, 1185? I thought you just kind of did something where you were changing it. I think you're going to go 1186, right? You're correct, yes. Okay. So I changed it to 1186 and saved it. Awesome. Yeah. So somehow one got reused, maybe it was edited, or somebody was maybe doing it at the same time, which doesn't usually happen. That's exactly what happened was one user was adding a job and I was adding a job at the same time and they both were assigned the same number. And so then we went and adjusted one of the numbers and it's been off ever since. Okay. So this will fix it going forward. Okay. Okay. Well, there's question number one. Question number two, I've had this happen before and I can't remember what I did to fix it, But when I inhale a resume, like from an email, it usually will pull up a screen that says successful or whatever. And then you have to click OK and it will show the person's name or whatever. And you can click on that and it opens the person's record in Edge, Microsoft Edge or whatever Edge is. It doesn't do that anymore. So now when I right-click and click Inhale, it just does a blank screen. So then I have to try to find the person. So I'll look them up by last name, but sometimes it's like – So you're using the Outlook portal, Adam? No. I'm just going into my inbox and right-clicking on my mouse and clicking Inhale. Oh. Okay. So that one doesn't even do – I never use inhale because it just kind of dumps them in without any kind of preview. I always use parse resume. Yeah, that takes too long. Okay. So I just dump them in. Inhale just dumps them in without any review. So it might be that maybe you have like your Chrome notifications disabled. Oh, okay. Not your Chrome, your Edge. If you're doing it in Edge. Well, it automatically, I think it defaults to Edge. I wish it would do it in Chrome. You might have to make sure your edge notifications are enabled. Okay. So that would be the three dots in the upper right-hand corner. It might even be a window setting. Hold on one second. Notification. Type in. Let's see. You're on a Windows computer. Yes. I never use it. Let's see. Let's see. Go to, like, notification and action settings. Just in the search bar? Yeah. in your Windows search option type the word notifications. Notification and actions okay. Okay so at the bottom so you got to make sure that it's on and then where it says get notifications from these senders do you have. Okay PCR HTML interface is off so maybe that's it. Well, it's really your browser that's going to trigger that too. Okay. Well, let me first ...
