## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yep, this is Brian Gruen with Gruen Search. We were longtime customers of PC Recruiter. And I'm looking back at my credit card statement from last month. Okay. We had the normal PC Recruiter charge on there at $178.98, which I have a receipt for and all that. But then we had another charge five days later on the 9th for $154.78 from something called in-main sequence. In-main sequence. Okay, let me see. And it's G-R-U-E-N, right? Yes. Okay. Because one thing it could be is that we switched billing systems. Mm-hmm. So let me see here. like we couldn't really transfer the card information over so maybe we had to reprocess one I'll tell you in one second though I'm pulling your information up g-r-u-e-n okay so you used to be a sales receipt invoice payment invoice payment invoice payment so you received the last payment we have is 7825 okay hold on one second where are these dates off here and why didn't you get 57 So, hold on once again, invoice payment, invoice payment. Why did not one even generate for you this month? What is the amount that you were invoiced? So, on the 4th, on the 4th, you know, I got, of July, I got your email and receipt that you were $178.98. Okay. Which wasn't an increase. That's all right. You know, fine. But that shows on my credit card on the 4th. So that's all great. Then on the 9th, I got another one for $154.78. And I have no receipt for that. Got nothing on that one. Why is that one? Okay, so it's really odd. I think that was your August. why did that did you do any user changes or anything like I think something okay my guess is let me just check your account do they have like no tax or out of state applied I believe our bookkeeping consultant might have made a mistake okay on I okay this kind of makes sense because you were invoiced normally you're invoiced on the 4th. Uh-huh. It looks like. It doesn't look like I've been invoiced for August. Yeah, I think what they might have done is they might have, because they were, so many of our customers don't have like the correct tax applied and yours does say out of state now, which would be correct for you. And I think when they went and they did that, I think they made the invoice to the date that they did that and it should have been your August invoice. So I think what needs to actually happen is this 7-8 invoice, the one that you paid on 7-8, was actually your August. It should have been your August. Okay. Here, I'm going to just fix – I'm going to fix – I don't want to fix the payment date, but I am going to fix the invoice date because it actually kind of threw me off there. on our credit card statement the phone number for that second invoice was different than this number and when I called that number it just went to voicemail what was the number it said 440 725 8074 I wonder if that's even us that doesn't even sound right yeah i don't know okay so i believe but you've got record of you've got record of the invoice for 154.78 154.78 you did make a payment on july 8th okay that's the day for the card and i think that was should have been for your august 4th um because it did say yeah because it did say it kind of generated august 4th so i think what happened is when they went into that invoice to change it to out-of-state tax, which is not changing any rate, but I think it changed the date. So that at least makes that look correct because your next one's not scheduled until September 4th. Okay. Okay. So I think they just messed up. They might've just changed the date by accident. Probably the date that they were editing. Can you email me a receipt for August being paid? Yeah. Let me do that now. I'm going to do that out of our new system though so that way you see. I went in and changed the date to make sure it synced over. Gruen. Okay, go here. And I'm going to go to invoices. Okay. So I changed the date on it, and you'll see it shows it's paid. And then you're not – so, yeah, I'm pretty sure that's probably what happened. Because I was like, oh, why wasn't it even invoiced? And just looking at how the dates are, I think they just messed it up. So I fixed the date on it. I think that's the problem. I was just afraid somebody was, you know, created like a ghost site and was sending invoices out in your name or something. Yeah, no, no, this seems right. Yeah, like not yet. Okay. I believe because that was around the time where they were going in and making those changes. And I think for some of them, too, they were actually replacing like what people had to use their change. So there's been a couple of things I had to clean up there. But I think on this one, it just changed the date. So I just sent it to you. It's going to come from Billing at Main Sequence. Can you confirm that you received it? I got it. Okay. But it's for $166.88, and we paid $154.78, but it's showing paid. Yeah. And then the one before that, it looks like you were invoiced $166.88, but you paid $178.98. S...
