## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Name Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, Ben Williams. How are you doing? Good. How are you doing? Good. So, well, I got you two quick questions. So did you get an answer back on that, would I need to sign the MUVID database? That's the first one. Let's see. I'll look up the ticket and see where it's at currently. And then on the other one, I need to see what fields are being pulled by this one report that's in the database. I think they're all involved in. Okay. So I'm pulling up our ticket. we have open where we're changing the name of your database. Let's see. Okay, last thing here is reaching out to send a message to my supervisor asking If there's a different document you can sign rather than the standard consulting document, I think that's where it lies. Is that still the case? You want to sign a different document? That document is like how many pages long the one you sent me? Oh, I'm not sure. Yeah, it's just our standard. If we make any changes to a database, we just need that document signed before we can make changes. It's just the standard one we send out. It was probably from William Kubicek. I suppose last name. K-U-B-I-C-E-K. For the PandaDocs? Yeah, exactly. This is the one that I sent out. for the panda docs yeah exactly uh this is the one that i found in 2024. okay um the email address also might be docs email.pandadoc.net it could be either one okay um other question you have like a um just like a sql editor and you're adding the drop and drop the drop and add certain fields. I don't want to have to get it right in some custom queries. I can but I've got to get the database from you and all that kind of stuff. But I think it was like a little SQL editor. But I have, there's two reports in here that I think were developed for us. Can you go into my database and just take a look? Because those reports aren't pulling any data right now. Okay, yeah, let me take a look here. So if you go under Contractor, Contract and Temp, what's it called? Under Reports, under Contracts slash Temp Reports. Okay, voting now, Contract Temp Reports, okay. Okay, and there's a contract, there's a split report and a commission report. Are those standard in your database or those custom ones for our database? Those are standard. You'll have to have split desk turned on for your database. Let me see if that is currently turned on. What is split desk? So that's where you would give percentages to different team members for making placements. Yeah, it looks like you do have that turned on for your database. Okay. Okay, so definitely need that. Splits reports. Okay. Is there a certain period that you've made placements? I could run this. I'll try running the splits report. Yeah, I just ran it for the week of the 28th. Okay. It didn't give me any results. All those reports when I pull them says no records filed. So it looks like it's pulling from somewhere. I just added some hours and other stuff in, like, yeah. like if I pull the time profit report that one now shows me a result so I think that it just needs to there now is a split is a split shown in the database yeah that's right guys what do I have to split what do I have to split I think you go to system in the main menu up at the top and then just type in split desk in the little search bar on the left and on the right you'll have results with split desk just go to the one that called called split desk and this will show you looks like you're using ownership fields on the candidate company position records so these are the percentages that people will be getting for movement and Now this is standard, right? This is standard, right? I can't change the first. I don't think so. You can change these. It usually would total up to 100%. So it looks like these have been edited to only total up to 17% currently. Yep. I'm looking at it right now. Yep. Okay. okay oh and I did this flip desk I didn't see the same as an option okay so what is permission only mode it says flick that configure permission only mode enable that would be where you're not using percentages you're just entering in a commission as you make a placement like a number rather than using percentages of a that it calculates for you so then yeah you asked about the SAM one it looks like if you go to the setting or the system search you did for split desk there's another result called split desk types we have Sam listed there it looks like it was added we let's see I don't remember how to turn that one so great so the question is okay you said it needs to be so right now if I go to split that okay i think the way that it used to set up is that means whoever owns the candidate gets 17 it's seven percent whoever owns the position gets ten percent that would that would be very much of how we um uh how we set it up with our uh okay with our recruiters and sales so So you said it should all add up to 100, correct? Right. So if you don't have yourself as a team...
