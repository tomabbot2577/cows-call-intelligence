## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. to someone about the... I think that's it. Okay. Hello? Hello, Jordan, do you hear me? Hello, Jordan, do you hear me? Hey, Jim there. Yeah, I didn't know if you heard me that first time. I saw you dial in and I couldn't hear you, but now here we are. Yeah, how are you? Here we are. I am doing great, man. How are you? It's been a minute since you and I chatted. For sure. For sure. Yeah, yeah. We're doing all right. Doing all right here. Plugging along and doing okay. I understand you guys are leaving. You guys are having a good time? Yeah, yeah. Doing all right. Yeah, and you all are leaving SRA, I think, in about a week. We are leaving SRA, yes, sir, in about a week. Yeah, it's been a phenomenal five years. Well, we just kind of got to the point. I don't know how much you remember about us, but we were part of MRI back in the day, too. So we've been in the franchise world for as long as we can remember. And there's just a point in which we just want to, yeah, I think we just want to kind of spread our own wings and see what happens. You've built it. You've got a huge, I'm sure, a huge customer base. You've got a nice large user base. It's certainly time. Yeah, man. So let's chat about PCR and let's chat about what we can do from a contract standpoint. And let me tell you where I'm coming from. I've been thinking about an analogy that would work well for us today. Think about the person who just got out of a long-term relationship and is now looking at like, hey, listen, I just got out of a five-year relationship. I'm not thrilled about wanting to lock into more long-term relationships. That is the disposition that we are coming from. It is not from a disposition of like being discontent in any way, shape, or form with BCR, you, your team, right? Everything has been fantastic. We've loved the flexibility and creativity and autonomy that you guys have given us in helping to shape the system and the field and the back end to what we need. we're just looking at it from like, okay, so how can we kind of, in some way, like take back some more control where we feel like we've been locked into other things. So that's where the spirit of the conversation from my end is coming from, has nothing to do with anything that PCR has done or hasn't done over the last five years of us working together, if that makes sense. Okay, sure, sure. Certainly it does. Yeah. Yeah. So you won't, I think you're under the three-year contract now. And we, outside of SRE, we really don't offer a three-year contract that's why theirs is so unique and wildly so much lower than everybody else's uh because they for some reason talked with our owners they wanted a three-year we agreed to it and that's that but most of the time we don't do a three-year um i thought there's no uh i have to get it up from that 50 number it doesn't have to like double or anything like that which is great uh some of the other ones have a specific percentage it must go up so we don't have a minimum like that um the list price on the package which all they're looking at I think is 115 per user per month so you guys are already getting a phenomenal deal of 50 I think what we were talking about was we were doing we offered two terms a one year or a two year depending on how long I didn't even broach a three year and for the two year I was able to do 65 per user per month the one year 75 per user per month keeping your same package your same users nothing would change and And I don't think we would need to change the name of, like, your database or anything like that, because I don't think you ever moved to anything formally SRA. No. Everything in our database is Bridger Group. There's no SRA emblems. Yeah, just our URL has SRA on it. Yeah, I noticed it has it, but that's only you, like, office-facing. nobody else would really see that. Yes. Yes. With the difference between the two-year and one-year contract, what is the minimum accounts that we need to have in that? And is there any way in the world we get down to 65 per user per month with a one-year contract, given the history that we have in the last five years in PCR, as well as the growth that we have? Because we are, I'd tell you, and you recognize this, where we've been. We're about 12 years in 2020, 2021 when we joined y'all. We're just under 40 right now. Our plans are to double again in the next five years. So we are certainly a growing customer for sure. Oh, for sure. Yeah. You all have grown pretty regularly as we've moved along through. Yeah. So not looking for a two-year. Let me see. So I'm a 75. I could probably do, if you're looking for a one year I think I can do 69 and the reason being because some of the other specials that we offer have a 69 rate and we don't like to go under that rate for some of those other spe...
