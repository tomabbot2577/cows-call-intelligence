## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? I'm not sure you can help me, Garrett, but I'm going to give it my best shot. All right. Hold on just a moment, please. All right. Okay. Okay. I'm with Summerfield Associates in Memphis. Okay. And I am trying to inhale or parse a resume, and I am not having any luck. Okay. Are you doing that through Microsoft Outlook or just on your web browser like Google Chrome? No, Microsoft Outlook. Okay. Do you know if you are using Microsoft Outlook Classic or Microsoft Outlook New? I guess it's new because we updated our computers, so I guess it would be the new. Okay. So our add-in is what it's called. Our add-in for Microsoft Outlook is only compatible with the classic version of Outlook. Microsoft doesn't allow third parties to have add-ins on their new version, so we're kind of locked out of that. we can check to see, I could give you quick instructions here to see if Microsoft Outlook Classic is still on your computer. So if you go to the bottom of your screen by the Windows logo, there should be a search bar down there. Search bar. All right. What am I going to search for? Just look for Outlook and then hopefully one of your results will say Outlook Classic. No, it just brings up my email. Okay, so when you typed in Outlook in that search bar, did it have any programs listed as search results? It would be, it's a search bar way at the bottom of your screen, as far down as you can go, right next to the Windows logo. Well, I'm probably not in the right place then because I'm not. Okay. No worries. Okay, so if you look at the very bottom of your screen, are you seeing like a date and time at the bottom right? I'm not sure I'm even in the right spot since I've gotten this new one I'm having trouble navigating it and I'm really not sure where I'm supposed to be and that's kind of been my biggest problem hopefully we can get you back over to the Outlook Classic if you still have that So, are you looking at the very bottom of your screen, bottom right? You should see a date and time. Is that visible? Yeah, 11-24-7-17. Perfect. Yeah. So, on that same row, if you go to the left more, you should see a search bar. In Nikon, OneDrive. It's more on the left side of the screen. If your date's on the right, this search bar will be on the left side of the screen on that same row as the date. I don't see a search bar on the left side. Okay. Is there any search bar like in the center among those icons? No. Okay. I don't see any. Do you see a Windows logo anywhere on that bar at the bottom? Microsoft Edge, Word, Excel. It would be farther left than that. There's a start, and when I bring it up, it shows me what's been pinned, which is Edge, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft 365, Outlook, Microsoft Store, Photos. Okay, so when you're hitting start, does that give you a place to use a search bar anywhere? Is there a search bar near that start button? Well, there is in this particular right here. Okay. And I clicked on it, and it says get started, Microsoft Edge, email an account, check for update, paint them. Got you. Okay, so those are all your programs there when you click on start. And if you do see a search bar when you click on start, we want to type in Outlook there. O-U-T-L-O-M-A, Outlook. All right, and then hit enter on your keyboard. I see Outlook Classic right now. Excellent. Click on that. We want to open that version of the program. All righty. All right. And it comes up open, new emails, new appointments, new meetings, new contact, new tasks. Okay. And it should be launching Outlook Classic on your computer. And it should look kind of more familiar since the update to Outlook New. Well, I don't use Outlook New. I've been going back to the old. Oh, good. Okay. Yeah. So that's Outlook Classic. Gotcha. All right. So did Outlook Classic open up on your computer already? No. Okay. Let's see. Let's try jumping on a screen share meeting. Maybe that will help and I'll be able to see your screen. So you're going to want to go to a website. So open up your browser, and I'll give you a web address when you're ready. All right. I'm ready. That is meetings.ringcentral.com. Ringcentral.com. Meetings. Ring. Central. C-E-N-T-R-A-L.com. All right. and make sure there's a period in between meetings and ring central so meetings.ringcentral.com i got it all right let's see it come on come on there it's working a new tab okay all right air calls aren't closed ring central meetings RingCentral Solutions? It should be prompting you to put in a meeting ID. Check that web address again. Make sure it says meetings, plural with an S, meetings, period, ringcentral.com. All right. Let's see. M-E-E-T-I-N-G-S dot ring, R-I-N-G, central, C-E-N-N-T-R-A-L dot C-O-M, right? Excellent. Yep, and hit enter. That should get you to the right place. Ah, join a meeting. Perfect.
