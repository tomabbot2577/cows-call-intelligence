## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Greg. Hi, Greg. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. Oh, hi, Robin. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? I'm good. I'm good. I ended up leaving a message earlier. I did pay the balance. Yes. But I wasn't sure if I needed to call to give you my updated banking information. Let me see. You might have set it up when you paid. Let me just check for you. I think I did. I called you before I did all that. Yeah, that's what it's looking like. So what happened was we were using strictly like Intuit for billing. And we ended up switching to Biller Genie for like an interface because there's like a customer portal, stuff like that. We couldn't really transfer the card information over for auto pay to do it correctly. Well, we used to do like a sales receipt. My bank information changed, and I called you guys and left a couple messages in May to try to get that switched over. I had a whole checklist of all these different places I had to call and switch over my bank info, right? Oh, okay. And I had, yeah, two different messages I left with PCR. You guys were one of the things. But I never heard back, so then I thought, well, they'll reach out to me once they stop getting payments. Yeah. And the other thing, too, I think I was replying and then, like, sending you an email, like, here's what to do. And then they were bouncing. So, and then I think I eventually. You might have been emailing my old email. Yeah. I had that for a little bit. That doesn't exist anymore. Yeah. So it was kind of. Sorry about that. So the CompassMedTalent is the correct one, right? Yes. Yes. Okay. So I'm going to take this second email out. I remember switching it, trying to find what the email is because things were bouncing. Okay. So we just have Greg at Compass Medical Talent as the billing account. There is that billing portal link. If you ever want to go into it, you would have to create an account. It doesn't use anything like your PCR password or anything like that because some people that do billing don't even use Peace Recruiter. and it's also separate from peace recruiter because it's a separate site so um but you can always credit account go and see your invoices there's a vault area if you ever want to like change your payment method so what i see right now is you have a card that ends in 7264 the only details i can see and you do have auto pay turned on yep 7264 that's the correct one okay so because there was like since the switch it wasn't like processing there was three payments yeah wait no wait uh yeah three payments so that would have been like those last three invoices since we made the switch so probably you're okay and then your next one is scheduled for august 21st but that one will process automatically on the due date which is due approximately all right so you are all set thank you so much sorry for the craziness It was not a lot of fun switching this, for sure. Yeah, I bet. It will be much better going forward, though. Well, thank you for the call. Manual stuff. Thank you. Okay. Have a great week. You too. Bye-bye. All right. Thanks. Bye....
