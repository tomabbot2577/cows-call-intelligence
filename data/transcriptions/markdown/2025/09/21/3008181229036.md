 Hello? Can you hear me? Am I muted? No. Are you muted? Hello? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me all right? Hey, RingCentral. if I like unplug my microphone or anything happens, I just can't find it when I plug it back in. Okay. Anyway. All right. Yeah. Sorry about that. And a proud music, right? But, but, yeah, okay. Okay. So we have one Oh one three Oh two, right? There it is. Yep. Yeah. Let's look at it. funny you guys in that meeting were telling me to be like tell them all this tell them all that tell them all this and there was like a message earlier to a different client that i actually typed all that stuff out and i was like man this just feels like i'm just like berating them for being dumb so i was like i just deleted half of it and just left it as like this is how you change it for other users in the future and that was like my passive-aggressive way of saying like There you go. Your responsibility. Yeah, I like that. That was a good way to put it. Yeah, I'm convinced now my role in customer support is just education so that I can learn these people so that they stop calling in. Yeah, you have so much patience. And so I'm like, dude, screw these people. Like, I'm like, all right, hold on. The ticket started off as being like, add a database. And I'm like, oh, easy, cool. They like want a database. I got it. I add it. And I'm like, hey, I added your database. Here's the credentials or whatever. Here's how you log in. Boom. Cool. And then they're like, cool. Can you copy the layouts? I was like, here's how you copy layouts. And they're like, what if I have custom fields? And I was like, that's a great question. And I was like, shit, dude. there's no easy way to copy custom fields from like old database to new database so i was like i was like fine so i like i made an insert into statement like and i copied all their old custom fields into their new day oh nice which is actually six different sql statements because you have to do company name position and then there's also there's like the there's like the field itself and then like the default values so i had to do all that and then i was like okay i copied them over for you like hooray i was like so now you could use those instructions i sent you to uh you know to copy that over and you'll be good and they're like cool thanks and then she's like i listened to your instructions and it didn't work and i'm like dude i know you did it i i tried it in my database it worked and i was like all right i'm gonna try this one time in their database and if it works i'm gonna be pissed so i tried it and i did it i did exactly what my instruction set and i copied it and it worked and i was like hey uh i copied it for you you must have missed something there you go like make sure to follow all the instructions exactly when doing it in the future and then i was like then after that it was like i had like four more sentences where i'm like it's not my responsibility to do this you know i'm like trying to like explain like why i'm not just doing it and then i'm like it just feels so like i'm just being like i'm like being mean almost so i just deleted that second half part and just like this is how you do it in the future and then she's like thanks for your help it's like screw you didn't want to do it like i know you know you didn't try that right dude i i've just been resorting to like here's the link to the learning center article i just push that so hard so people start getting the idea hey i don't have to pick up the phone and call you twice a day i can actually go to the learning center that's what i well that that was that was what i did with the second one that i brought up yeah i like that where i was like here's the learning center articles there's different ways you can do it like figure it out and then they're like can you do it oh it's like no i don't have one guy like there's thousands of you guys i can't just sit there and do your job yeah right back and call anyway all right all right frustrations over brian dunn okay yeah so let me wrap my head again around this i know what to do right it's okay right so i just had to clarify one thing about this so do you know that like all those bounces like were like false bounces that's why you're just like so gung-ho about removing them because i was like hold on like why are they there in the first place is it like did they have like a bad send where like everything was like falsely bounced? Yeah, I believe they were sending out too many emails at once and Microsoft penalized them. And, you know, like anything they sent out in that hour or wherever the time limit was, maybe even for that day, just started coming back as bounces because they hit their limit of sending with Microsoft. So once that time expired, where they were in their little time out corner with Microsoft, then they could probably send to these people again, but now they've been added to our opt-out list automatically.
