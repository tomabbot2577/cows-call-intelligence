## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Mean Seek Technologies. This is Jason. How can I help you? Hey, good morning, Jason. This is Sam from Legacy Digitronics. So I had a quick question where we had multiple database and we wanted to close or delete two or three. Okay. What company were you with again? Legacy Digitronics. Okay. Give me one second. What was your name one more time? I'm calling on behalf of Raj. Raj Kapoor. Okay. To close databases, I believe we're going to need to get the contract signer Raj to fill out a form. Basically, do you want them deleted from your ASP login page? Yeah, that's right. okay um yeah i believe we're going to need to get raj to fill out a form um i need to find exactly which form it go ahead yeah so can you send those forms and do you need any kind of database information uh for that i can i can give you those database yeah i'm going to create a ticket on the phone with you now um but i'm going to put the ticket in raj's name um those forms are going to to be sent and filled out by him and returned from him. So let me get the ticket created. One second. Okay, what are the name of the databases? Okay, the first one is Digital Infinity. Second one is Insurance Doctor. Third one is SMTP server. Okay. I'm going to get this ticket created. I need to find which form needs to be sent over, but I'll email that to Raj once I have it. and once that's returned, we'll be able to take those databases out, but I have to figure out which form I need to send, so I'll get that over to them as soon as I have it. So what's the process? Like for each database, there will be a separate form? I believe it's probably going to be a separate form per database, but again, I don't have the form in front of me. I don't know exactly what it looks like, so I need to find it and send it over, But if it's one form per database, I would need three returned. But I'll clarify all that when I send it over. Okay. And before deleting this database, should I be looking into something else before I delete them? Anything to be taken as a precaution? If you want the data in there, you should take it out. Again, the process for deleting databases doesn't happen too often. So this is kind of the first time I'm running into the specifics of how that's going to happen. I don't know exactly what they do with the data. If you want the data, it might be best to start moving it into other databases. But I need to see what the specific process of that looks like. So I'll clarify all that with Raj when I send it over. Sure. All right, Jason. Thank you so much. I guess that's all I needed now. Okay. Sounds good. you have a good day alright you do bye bye...
