Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Andrew. How are you? Good. Hi, Jim. Hi. Can you hear me okay? I do. I do. I'm going to throw my video as well. There. Yeah, I hear you just fine. Yeah, great. Good morning. Very well. Good to meet you. Nice meeting you too. For sure. For sure. So I wanted to talk with you a little bit about PCRecruiter as it is what you get with dimensional search. And have you seen it? Did you have any questions around the package or anything like that? I think they show you a couple of demos of it or show you around a bit. But just wanted to see if you had any initial questions. Not right. No, it's been a while. So I don't think I... One second please, can I just take a quick question? Sorry, it's so bad. Take your time, absolutely. Sorry about that. It will. Good morning, how do you do? I'm doing fine, thanks. And is it 7 o'clock? Yeah, it's 6.30. Fantastic. Could you let us know when you get back? I'll be somewhere around here, so if you call us, we'll go and say the pay is about $1,000. Sounds good. Fantastic, good luck. I'm going to have to switch this to the order, and I'm just going to bring it to you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Sounds good. Great. Thank you. Bye. Sorry about that. No problem. No problem. So, yeah, a little bit about – So, I don't know – yeah, I don't really know anything that I remember from PC Rehab. from PC Recruiter. So we can probably just start with brand new sheet. Perfect. So what generally happens is PC Recruiter is the product that you get to track all of your efforts and your data and everything within the system. And us and Dimensional Search kind of play hand in hand to get you trained up on the system and recruiting and everything in general. So what would happen is we would initially get you signed up on PC Recruiter. You'd get a PC Recruiter account. You'd also get a dedicated trainer here assigned on our end. So that trainer would then give you a few hours of training before your dimensional search training. And are you in the October class for that? I'm in September class. Oh, September. Okay. So I think it's the 6th? So the September class. So what we'll want to do is go ahead and get everything set up and sign up so you can get a couple hours training initially. And your PC recruiter trainer would go over some of the basic setup, how to use the system, go over any initial questions, get you up and running. And they would also get you the logon credentials to your database. They would have several sessions. And I think that dimensional search also will take your logon credentials and pre-populate some data. I think they do that too. And then they'll take over dimensional search training on their end when you go into the class. And then they'll kind of put you back to PC Recruiter and they have a set training syllabus that they kind of go through to play off of one another. OK. And what I could do, I could email over the paperwork for you to review. See all that information. It is. Are you just one user? Yeah. OK. One user. So it's $50 per month for that one user. and then 750 is the one-time setup and that's what includes creating the database link those 10 hours training and your initial consulting call to get you introduced to the trainer and everything like that so it's $800 would get you set up and what we do is we email the paperwork it comes through as a panda doc much like a DocuSign just a different brand name once you sign that the invoice would be sent for the setup in first month that's $800 and once that's paid within one to two days the link is created sent over and then a training ticket is put into our queue so that you can have a trainer assigned so they would be able to then reach out to get something going there okay so you have a company name yet yeah it's wave crest search and is it one word or two one word one word wave crest is one word actually perfect I was going to say throw it in the chat there okay wave crest and I capitalized the C so we'll not do that yeah and then what is the street address and the best email address and phone number for you as well because I need to have the street address to make the contract. You need to make sure you're not on Ohio so I don't have to charge sales tax. Okay and I think I have your email is it the Gmail address that we've been using? No email is going to be changed too. So I have a new domain so okay what's the best number for you if you could throw that in there as well just because I don't think I have a number for you at all. Yeah, so I am in the middle of transitioning from my personal phone to a RingCentral. So this is going to be a RingCentral. Hopefully it will be set up like today ...
