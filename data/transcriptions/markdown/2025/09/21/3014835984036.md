## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Mean Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hi, McKenzie. This is Cliff Rustak calling from MWorks Search. How are you doing? I'm doing fine. How are you, Cliff? Good, good. I had a couple of questions today. The first one is regarding sequences. So I put a list together. I give my researcher the list. They find contact information. They put the names in the PCR, and then the sequence sort of gets going. So if I have roll-ups, I have activity codes that I click after making a call or an activity. One of them is like wrong info. So if there's wrong info, I click it. Then I tell my researcher, go back in this roll-up, check all the wrong infos, and fix them. How do I do that in a sequence? because I don't have an activity code like that. I see. Okay. Let me catch up to you. One second. Here, go back and check the wrong info. Is wrong info one word or two? I don't know. I'm not in a roll-up. I'm in a sequence. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, I know everybody's got different codes, but one of my codes is like wrong info. or, you know, so I just tell them, this code, go take a look. So it's like six or nine, I think, if I'm in a roll-up. But I don't really do, like, recruiting in roll-ups anymore. I'm doing recruiting in sequences. But about half the names or email addresses are wrong. So I want to know what the best practice is and a quick way to say, hey, this is wrong. go back and take a look, see if we can find a phone or an email that's better. Right now I'm not doing anything, so I'm losing like half the people. Okay, so when you do send to the wrong info, is your sequence like executing like an automated message or something like that? Like so it's going to like nowhere or is it just not, is it doesn't do anything? Well, there's two things. Well, the two activities that are going to drive that type of response is either a phone call, like this phone number has been disconnected. I get that message, or it's like, hey, this is Amy, and I'm trying to call McKenzie, so I know the phone number's wrong, or inactive, or discontinued. Or the email, if the email is wrong, it'll bounce. Okay, so this is a phone thing. Oh, okay. It's mainly phone. It's not as much email because the email response that you get sometimes is they'll opt out. Or if they don't opt out, you know, they have their filters set up where it's opting out. So can't really do anything with that one. It's a good email. It's just they're opting out of email communication. Gotcha. Okay. Yeah, I'm sorry. This is a strictly phone issue. That's good to know. Mainly phone. Yeah, mainly phone. You said there's two things, and you went into one. And I thought it was just going to be simple phone and, like, email or something. So what was the first example that you gave me? So, you know, that's basically it. It's either the wrong phone or wrong person, and I know it. Okay, yeah, okay. And right now I'm not doing anything. But I'd really like to signal, hey, guys, go back and take a look at these names to see if we can get a better number. Okay, so you're working through the sequence yourself, and then when you come across a name and call them and find out it's the wrong info, you want to send it back to another person to kind of like update the information and then put it back on the roll-up list? I don't even want to remove it from the roll-up list. If it were in a roll-up list, instead of saying recruiting message one, recruiting message two, recruiting message three, I just click wrong info. Then I email my researcher and say, go into the roll-up, check out all the wrong infos, and see if we can find better phones. I want to be able to simply do that in a sequence because there's really no code. all I do is I like move it to the next, remove it from the sequence and put a note in there. Those are like the only things I can do that I'm aware of. Okay. I'm going to have to look at your setup. So let me pull up your name, Cliff. I haven't, I've been like writing down what you're saying. I haven't pulled up the account you're using. Give me one second. If you don't mind, let me catch up to you here. Yeah. if you called before i'm kind of guessing at how your name oh i think i found you are you using in the work search m work search oh okay yeah yeah okay sorry eric name i think it may maybe your name changed over time or maybe you bought this database or I don't know. For me, it looks like MR Wicker Park. Yeah. Oh, okay. But then in the second half of your name, it says Mwork Search. What's the username that you log into? ZRustnack. ZRustnack. Okay. Take a look. Hold it right. Oh, there's no C. I'm sorry. All right. Let me go. Sequencing. So are you using roll-up? When you said stages, are you using roll-up stages before? Yeah, you do have roll-up stages. I see. Okay, cool. But like I said, I'm not using roll-ups anymore. I'm using sequences. Yeah, okay. I'm trying to. But I'm not using the roll-up and roll-up stages. ...
