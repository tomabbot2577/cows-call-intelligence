## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. How are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm doing fine. Doing fine, thanks. My name is Russ, Russ Cipriani. I'm with the Edwards Search Group. I do my online or my cloud hosting for my database with you guys and for PC Recruiter. I have two users, myself and one other recruiter, that I prepaid for the year for. However, that second user is no longer working here at the end of the week. So I needed to, one, I know when I used to host PC Recruiter, I can just go in there and change the password and delete the user. But now that I'm in the cloud with you guys, this is the first time I've had to remove someone. So I don't know how to do that. Could you help me? It's the same process. Well, I went into the users, managed my users in here, and I can add users, but I couldn't delete one. so there is a delete option or you could just change the password and disable the user that well either way can you help me with that yeah yep give me one second to get logged in here so you'll do that system users manage users yep i was in there yep and you'll click on that username that you want to get rid of or defable and then once you click on it, there is that. Oh, you know what? I had to click it. Okay, I see it now. It's a red one. I clicked on his name before, but I was not clicking on the username. I was clicking on. Okay. That's why I couldn't get into it. I'm like, add, add. Okay, here he is. So now I'm in there. I can delete him. Yep. Or you can simply disable it by clicking the security tab over on the left. Yeah. and then scrolling all the way down to the security policy section. Yep. And then you just check the box that says account is disabled, and you would just save that change. Account is disabled. Perfect. So I can leave him on there as a user. I don't have to be deleted from the system, but the account would be disabled. Correct. Or I can do both. Yep. Okay. Now, because I had prepaid for this for the year, Is there some sort of pro-rated reimbursement I'll get for the cost? That I am unsure of. Let me see if your account manager, Jim Lombardo, is available. He'd be able to answer that question for you. All right. All right. Perfect. Other than that, Tyler, I'd pre-shout. Yeah. So, all right. So as soon as I disable that, yeah, he's done. He can't get in. Okay. All right. So it looks like Jim's currently on another call. What I could do is transfer you to his voicemail, and he can give you a call back as soon as he is available. yeah sure that'd be fine i appreciate it thank you tyler yep not a problem transferring you in three two one...
