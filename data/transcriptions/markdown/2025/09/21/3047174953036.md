## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. Just as Robin. My name is JP Wright. We use PCR for our contact management. And I have a question. We have our mail currently hosted through Google, through Google Sync Services. And we're going to be switching it over to Microsoft. Okay. Are there any changes that we need to make in PCR? Yeah, you would have to redo. If you use PCR mail, like you use analytics and campaigns, once it's switched over, you would need to make your incoming mail server for Gmail inactive and basically do a whole new setup for the incoming mail server as well as the email alias for the Office 365 account. Okay. Let me, so that's not done yet, right? No, I haven't done it yet. Okay. The other thing that you'll- I'm trying to make sure that I have all of, like, I know what all I need to do before I do the migration. Okay. And the other thing that you'll need to make sure that you do, and you have the right resources, is that correct? Yeah. Okay. I hear twice. Okay. Okay. The other thing that you'll want to make sure that you do, too, before people try authenticating with their email alias, once it's set up, there's going to be a setting within the Office 365 admin portal for each user. it's like where you go in to set up like like where you enable like can they have imap and things like that so it's going to be a setting called smtp authentication that office 365 has off by default so you'll need to turn it on otherwise even if they literally literally just saw that okay yeah you will need to make sure that that is enabled otherwise even if they use because you'll have to use the sign-in with microsoft just like right now you're the sign-in with Google. It's just that even if you sign in, it won't let you unless you change that setting. Is your email address jpw at right res.com? Yes. Okay. It's probably on our learning center, but I have a document that I'm going to email you that has the setup. It's very, very similar to doing this setup. I don't know if you remember doing this setup with your Gmail account. Very similar except you're redoing it with signing into the other account. Okay. So I'm going to send these instructions. Authenticated SMTP. Yeah, that one would have to be on. I just turned it on for all of us. now the email that we use currently like whenever we send messages through you like i don't know that we're set up like um to do like email tracking or anything like that like i'm not sure that's a that's um like cam like drip like marketing campaigns right well even if you So let me see your account. You do have the analytics and you don't have the sequencing, but you do have the analytics. You would want to make sure that you're set up with PCR mail because we need to see those emails come back to say that this is a reply for this campaign. I don't see that you have sequencing, but you have the campaign. And just so you know, just like Gmail, Office 365 is also pretty restrictive on how many emails they let you send. Yeah. So, yeah, okay. Like, I'm using, like, I switched over to using SourceWale now for a drip marketing campaign. And theirs is kind of automated, I guess. Like, it sends it through their servers instead of my servers. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Which I guess your mail, if I remember right, I think Matt said that whenever we send emails out of PCR, it sends them through your servers too, right? No, we connect to your mail server, which is whatever you have set up as your email alias list, that's what we're connecting to to send it. We don't actually send the emails. Gotcha. yeah for some reason the way he explained it I thought it sounded like they were going out through your servers and that's why because like I had to add unless it was unless it was never set up and then it could have been but I wouldn't oh gosh that would probably be really bad because we had so many people that probably never added their settings and the um the IP address the chances that it gets through I think it was kind of like a general IP and you wouldn't want to use it because it wouldn't be very reputable. Yeah, so we had to add a DNS setting to our host for you guys for PCR. Okay. Yeah, because we'd be connecting to it looks like you're set up right now to connect to a Gmail account. Okay. So it's basically the same thing that you did. Before, you just got to do it with your Office 365 account. Yeah, I see it here. There's a text file added that says SPF1 for PC recruiter. I see that on our website, I guess. I don't know. I'm just dumb enough to know what I don't know. Enough to be dangerous, right? Okay. So whenever I get this done, I can call in and you guys can help walk me through making sure it's set up correctly for everybody. Yeah. You just got to make sure that you have all the accounts, everyone knows how to sign in. And sometimes it's not so bad. Like if you already signed into your Office 365, it goes a little faster. what does become a problem is if you try to do the setup fo...
