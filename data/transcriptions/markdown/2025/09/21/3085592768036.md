## 💬 Full Transcript

 Robert, welcome. At the tone, please record your message. When you've finished recording, you may hang up or press 1 for more options. Hey, Robert, this is Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. I got the emails that you were exchanging with Robin about your PC Recruiter account. I understand you're looking to close that account. That is, your contract's October 18th, so as long as it's before then, no early termination at all. It looks like there's a couple outstanding invoices. Those will need to be paid before we can process that cancellation. And we also want to confirm greyrendalls at pinpointtrg.com is the address that those should be sent to. Please confirm that. and then finally I need a notification from Gilbert Reynolds as he is the agreement signer so he's someone that can request cancellations if you could please pass me along a signed cancellation request email from from him just requesting that cancellation I can get that ticket working in queue no data return needed so I'll put the cancellation date like the 18th of October so it won't all over new if you have any questions or anything give me a call four four zero eight five six zero three one four is my direct I'm also going to pop you an email as well thank you sir bye bye...
