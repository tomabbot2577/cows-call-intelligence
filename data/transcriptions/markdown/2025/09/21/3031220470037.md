## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. How can I help you? Oh, hey, this is, is this customer support? Did I get the right extension? I'm having some phone problems here. Sorry, I was having a phone problem there just a second ago as well. But no, yeah, it's customer support. Yeah, my name is Mackenzie. Oh, hey, Mackenzie. Yeah, this is Gary Dorn with Corwell. I just had a quick question about, so I created a position, and I have a candidate that I want to link to the position and send out a meeting invite, and I can't remember how to do that. Sure. Um, so on the name record, if you open it up, um, you'll see in the action menu on the name, there will be link to position. Um, and that should bring up a window. Okay. Where's that again? So I've got the candidate's name up. Let me, uh, let me pull up your account just so I could be looking at the same thing you're looking at because sometimes things are different. It's so customizable that a lot of times I can't just say go to this spot because some people move things around. How did you spell your last name, Gary? Just so I could look you up. D-O-H-R-N. Thank you. Core Wealth Search. Yeah. I'm going to log in as admin. Well, I'm sorry. Which database are you in? There's six options here in the login screen. I am in Corwell Church. Okay. Yeah, an easy way to know is to hover your mouse over the tab of the Chrome browser. It'll tell you the username and password that you're logged in as. Or sorry, the username and database. G-A-D Corwell. Okay, cool. Cool. So when you link them to the position, are they already linked to the position? Well, I thought I was, but I'm not 100% sure. I created the position, and then I thought I linked it, but I don't see anything on here that shows it's linked. Can I take a look at what's the position record in the database? I'll take a look and see if there's... Yeah, it's an Ameriprise Orange County. Okay, let's see if I can find anything. Fuzzy search, Orange County. Oh, found it. Oh, I spelled it with a Z, of course. Okay, I found Ameriprise, Orange County. I'm going to go to the pipeline. Let's see if there are any names in here. There's a Paul Liu in the box of the pipeline. Do you know how to look at the pipeline? No, I can't remember. okay uh so okay then actually you're going to navigate to the position record ameriprise orange county it'll be appearing in the bottom frame after you select it like from a search or however you get to the ameriprise yeah open up the just click on the job title of ameriprise orange county wherever you do see it and it'll load it in the bottom frame and then in the bottom frame there's tabs near the top left of the bottom frame and one of them says pipeline if you click pipe okay so I pulled up pipeline so I see the see the position where there's like vertical steps of the pipeline and then Paul Lu is all the way to the left in the inbox and like the starting position here is that what you see in the pipeline well I've just got it says Ameriprise Orange County available full-time Katie Bailey zero to one. It's the pipeline. I'm on zero the first step. So I click on it. Okay, so that brings up Paul Liu. Okay. Okay, so I've got Paul Liu pulled up. Okay, so are you looking at the pipeline, the entirety of it, where you see the different colored steps from left to right? Yeah, reviewed, contacted, sent to manager, viewed by manager. That's where, yeah, I was trying to get you there. Oh, great. Now we're on the same page, literally and figuratively. And then so Paul is in the inbox. That's where they go if you just link them to the pipeline. So whatever you did before you called was successful in linking Paul here. You could also click inside the inbox, like right above Paul's name, search to add to Pipeline. There's a little box there. You can click in there and search names out and add people from right there if you wanted to. You didn't have to, if you know their name or email address, search. I think you could search on email as well in that box, if I'm not mistaken. So you can more easily add people there if you like. But you said you wanted to send him like a meeting invite, I think. Well, I want to send a meeting invite to Katie and Paul for a call scheduled for tomorrow. Sure. Okay. So I don't know if you use the pipeline, but in the pipeline, there are ways to do that. You could move them perhaps to like the contacted step or just right click on Paul's name and go to add step. And that gives you a screen where you are able to move them to another step of the pipeline. But there's a send email option at the bottom. Yep. Okay. which can send to, like, it'll pull up, you see content. Can you pull up add step first and make sure that you're on the same page as me? I did. And so I see at the bottom it sends emails grayed out. Do I click that to the right? Right, yeah, click the toggle switch. And then this screen does a little bit of legwork for you. It pulls up the contact of the po...
