## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. This is Galini with Peterson Consulting. Hi. I was just told by Todd that we are still owing for an invoice. Let me check on that. Hold on one second. Let me see on that one. Hold on one second. Okay, so it looks like we received a payment on... let me check I have two systems now kind of like old and new so I like yeah both I like to check both um yeah okay okay so it looks like okay so you don't have auto pay enabled and you have two cards stored. Okay, so I'm the controller here. I've been here for about four months. I believe that the invoices are coming to the old controller's email, which is fine because they all end up coming to me anyways. So basically I've just been going to those emails and getting those invoices paid. I've paid up as far as the invoices have come in. I did not receive one for July. So I was waiting for that to come in to be able to pay it, but I haven't received one. So Todd's saying that he's trying to get some training with you guys, but they're saying that we're behind um we can go ahead and take care of that last invoice okay let me just see something here real quick okay so okay on july 1st it was sent to delaney b at oh you do have the right email yeah yeah so we do have that one now we might have changed it at some point um okay so the july one is open now we did receive a payment or two, let's see. We saved two payments in July. One was applied to, here with me one second. One was applied to your June invoice, your June 1st invoice. And then the other payment was applied, the one on the 17th was applied to the May invoice. So the July one is open. Okay. Now what I could do is you want me to just resend this one to you? You have to also have your August 1st, but that one's not. I'm seeing August in here. It says do August 31st. I see that one. That one's here in my email. I just never received one for July. Yeah. Let me send that to you. And we can take care of that Monday of next week. I let's see so I just sent the July one can you let me know if you just received it yeah and you know what this I don't really consider okay hold on one second because the other ones were paid let me just see if I just need to mark you hold on one second Peterson they're not behind enough to really stop training so I'm going to I know I were like it's like it's I'm sure we're selling at $130. Yeah, part of it is me having to go back and read. Some things are a little bit manual. We also keep customers in PCR. So I just kind of go through and like, okay, did they pay through? And that part has to be manual for me to update the status. So what I can do, now, were you wanting to buy training then? Is there a ticket created for that already? I'm not sure. let me see what Todd said because it's he's the one that I did get the invoice by the way and then he said um yeah the other ones I probably just needed to update the status so I did change that because I said I'm trained yeah I'm trying to get pay for PCR training and they said we're not up to date on billing okay so I said which we need before they approve any training okay so So I have done that. Now, do you know who he was talking to or a ticket number? It looks like Garrett Kamiati. Okay. Yeah, so if you want to – I'm not seeing a ticket created. Maybe he just talked to him. Oh, I have a ticket right here. Do you want me to send this to you? What's the number? I'm in there too. Oh, it's like forever long. Let me see if I can click on it. It gives me a number. Oh. There should be like a five. Oh, capture. So this is capture not displaying. Okay, I see that one. Number 102223. Yeah, it's your most recent one. Okay, so let me see. Did they talk about training? Okay. Okay. Okay. okay okay now do you want me so i'll let him know let's see that it's okay to proceed with that. And I've updated my side. With the new building system, I'm really behind on stuff. And I'm really trying to catch up. But it's taking a little bit longer than I had hoped. Okay. So I noted to Garrett that it's okay to proceed with training. Okay. And what we'll do is we'll create a separate ticket, I guess, once they decide how many hours or things like that. And then what I'll do is I'll send another invoice for that amount once that's confirmed. Okay, so that he'll be able to proceed with training. And then just let him know we'll get that other invoice paid on Monday. Yeah, no problem. Yeah, it's not behind enough. It was probably the other ones, and I just didn't go back and change the status. Oh, okay. Perfect. All righty. You're all set, though. All right. Thank you. You are welcome. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye. Bye....
