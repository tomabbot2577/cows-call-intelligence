## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, it's Wayne Miller. Hello, Wayne. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Hey, I'm doing well. How are you doing? Pretty well. Pretty well. I got your voicemail. I wanted to give you a call back and kind of see about getting a time set up early next week to take a look at the PCRM demo. Okay. All right. Yeah, we can do that. Can you tell me a little bit about it? Yeah. How long has it been out? I haven't heard about it until this week. How long has it been out? Maybe April, May is when it was fully released. It was going to be a replacement for PCR9, like a whole new interface, but they decided to spin it off rather as a separate product called PCRM. It's more of a CRM product, but it works off of the same database, and it contains all the same functionality, just in a new interface. so it is something that there's no conversion there's no move to it you can simply add it and have a secondary url from which you can access the database and it would be the same database same username password data it's just this whole new interface and since there's no conversion it's not all that expensive to do it's 350 set up and then an additional 10 bucks per user per month to move you over to it, and that includes four hours training. Okay. How does the – okay, that's not too concerning, I guess. The 350, I'm kind of seeing strange after all this. That's okay. What about the – because right now I'm looking at a couple things that I get so frustrated with PCR, it just pisses me off, and that's – the number one thing is the whole import of data because of creating duplicates. But I'm looking elsewhere, like I'm looking at TopEssalon, I'm looking at LOXO, just be upfront with you because when I import data in there, it's not so company dependent. The names are kind of record on their own and all that. But is there anything on the horizon to help with that whole import utility because it just sucks, to be honest with you. Like are you importing with a spreadsheet or parsing in a resume? What part are you using? Yeah, importing a spreadsheet. So, for instance, I took a roll-up list and I put it into clay.com to do some enrichment on it, to get some email address and phone numbers. Then I bring that back in. If people don't have emails for it, I brought that back in and a search from Clay, brought it back into another program to get emails and phone numbers. So now I've got, instead of 4,000 on my list of engineers in my PCR, I've now got 8,000 engineers from those same companies. But now I have email addresses and phone numbers and some personal, some work emails. And I know from doing a small scale, when I try and import some of those in, I almost have as many duplicates because I may have a work email address in PCR and now I've found a personal email and it says, well, it's a different email, it must be a different candidate. So now I end up with thousands of duplicates that I've got to go through one at a time, painstakingly, to merge. So I'm hesitant to do that because of how much time it's going to take to do this with all my new data I have. And so that's why I said if I'm going to do all that, I may look at somewhere else where I can do it. But is there anything out there that's on the horizon that will solve that problem? They are working on the new – so right now the PCRM doesn't have an import yet. So that's being worked on. I don't know if there's any changes to it. But are you using the duplicate update as it is, telling it kind of which – okay, but since it's a lot of times different emails, it's causing issues. Right, right. And if I don't have the – let's say I have – I may have train – train as a company train technologies for example and then if I had a little different train tech or train just trained by itself it's going to create a duplicate if I do it by email it's a different email address it creates a duplicate and then sometimes it goes to the wrong company so I mean I'd almost have to sanitize my spreadsheet by going and making sure I had all the you know everybody at this in this location had exact same company and then everybody this location is the exact same company as what was put in the database and then you know the LinkedIn thing you got a separate category there you got to make sure your column on your data on your spreadsheet the right thing so it's a lot of mess and it creates a lot of duplicates now let me go back to that concern you just had you said that PCRM has no way of importing data in at this point doesn't right now because that's not built into it yet it is in the works for in the next couple months but there's no day they import right now they're not even by resume parsing not even by email parsing your resume oh no there's parsing certainly there's parsing there is better parsing better duplicate matching and detection there in PCRM okay but there's just the we can also talk about yeah I don't know there's no huge changes coming to the the data import that I know of, a...
