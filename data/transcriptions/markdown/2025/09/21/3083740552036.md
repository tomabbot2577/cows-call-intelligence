## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yeah, hey, Robin. This is Rich Loeb. I was looking for technical support. Yes, what can I help you with? Great, thank you. So I had called in about a – I'm pretty sure you're going to have to dial in to my system to see. So you know how you bring in a file – when you bring in a candidate from LinkedIn, in. Okay. So, and you know, you get, you know, the, you know, the option to update. Yes. I don't, I don't have that. And then the other is, and by the way, I noticed a problem and this is what I want you to see. When I go to open up my Chrome, I have all these things along the top I've never seen before. Something is screwy in my settings and I was hoping you could help me. Okay for the issue with the capture I think if you click directly if you correct if you click directly on the extension at the top right of your browser that'll open up like like what sites it'll work on. At the very bottom right of that pop-up where it says basic mode do you happen to have that on because you'll want to turn that off. Oh, basically. It should be gray. Sorry. It is gray. It is gray. Okay. Because I was sounding like maybe. I have capture default company on. So, yeah, the different settings. What basic mode means, it's for the people that just want to be fast, like kind of add and go. It doesn't give you any review screen. So based on your description, I thought maybe that was it. And then capture to default company, That just means instead of trying to get their company, it just puts them into the default. Right. That's what I want. But basic mode is grayed out. It is grayed out. Okay. So let's do a screen share. Bear with me one second. Let me – let's see. Do you happen to have RingCentral? No, but I've logged in before. Is it RingCentral? That's okay. I'll just send you a Google. I'll just send you a Google Meet then. Let's see. Okay. I have the RingCentral login if you want. No, that's okay. I just sent you an email, and it's going to have a link to join a Google Meet. Great. Join call? Yep. And then when you are joining, it's going to ask you about sharing your camera, which we don't need because we're going to show your screen instead. And then it's going to ask you about joining computer audio. Don't join with computer audio since we are already on the phone. So ready to join, ask to join. Do I click that? Yes. Okay. Sorry, it's still doing its thing. Yep, you're in now. Okay, so here's what I'm going to have you do. I'm going to have you click on the share screen option, which is at the bottom of the meeting window. It's the rectangle with the arrow. That's going to pop up a window. Make sure you go over at the right and select entire screen and then pick which screen to show. You are show screen anyway. Okay and don't worry about that. We just go over to another tab. Don't close the me tab but just go ahead and kind of go over to something else. Okay so you see this tab Look at, see all this up here. I never had this stuff before. So that's your bookmarks bar. So if you go to the three vertical dots, those are basically like shortcuts, things that you bookmark so they're easy to get to. So if you go to the three vertical dots, go down to bookmarks and lists. Okay. then okay why is your thing so far when it's okay click with a show bookmarks bar okay then go back and hide it it's kind of weird like it said it would have This is actually hidden already. Go back to bookmarks and lists again. Okay, hide bookmarks bar. Why is yours not going away? Okay, let me think about this. Hold on one second. I told you I had a problem. Aren't you glad you got me? What else could be in there? So those are bookmarks. Okay, let's do the same thing and maybe next to reading list. Those are bookmarks though. Okay, go to reading list. Just above there. No, okay. Show all bookmarks. That's really odd. Okay, let's try this. Go to help down at the bottom right of your of that menu. So the menu kind of before it that you were in. Go to help. Go to about Google Chrome. Let's first try updating Chrome. I might leave. Okay, let's see if there's anything going on here. It's kind of weird. I mean, usually it'll say, like, whether to show it or hide it. Relaunch? Yes. Now, I still have you on the phone. If it doesn't put you right back in the meeting, I'll need you to have to go back to that email again and then rejoin, since you're rejoining through the browser. No problem. Okay, and go back to share screen. And just remember to share entire screen. Okay, looks like it's gone. If you go back to one of your other tabs, let's just kind of confirm. Oh, no, but it's still there. Okay. Let me Google this. Chrome. Why are my bookmarks showing in Chrome? one set not two. Okay so what this is saying is that your bookmarks are likely showing because you're assigned into a chrome profile that has chrome sync enabled which is syncing your bookmark settings across your signed in devices. so that could be ...
