## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hello, Daniel? Yeah, it is, Daniel. Good morning. Yeah, good morning. This is Jim with PC Recruiter. And I just happened to look at your time. It's awfully early for you. I'm on Eastern time. I thought you were the same. Are you available now, or should I try you a little bit? Yeah, you can talk right now. Probably, yeah. I just kind of wanted to follow up on your inquiry into PC Recruiter, see what you were looking for in the software, and see if maybe it was worth getting a demo on the schedule to show you around. So I wanted just to see what you were looking for really primarily. Yeah, primarily we're looking for posting jobs right now, sending jobs out to job boards, and also onboarding right now. Do you guys offer e-signatures? Not yet. So we don't have any e-signatures yet. and we post, we can feed to LinkedIn and Indeed. We don't have any mass job posting capabilities, so we don't blast them out to free job boards or anything like that. We can't do that. Okay. So how long does it take to get implemented into the system if somebody was going to give it a try? Usually, so if you were going to set it up, A couple of weeks to 30 days would be set up, trained, up and running on the system there. But we can get it turned on in just a couple of days if you were looking to get something set up. It's a pretty quick setup process. Okay. Yeah, that sounds good. I would like to go to the demo to see what it looks like before making a decision for it. Sure. What would work? Right now we do the manual processes. It's pretty much manual through spreadsheets. and we do referrals for recruiting right now. So it's pretty much manual relations like automate everything and make everything more centralized in one place. Okay. Yeah, even if you have spreadsheets, we can import that data into PC Recruiter. So that is a feature. Okay. So I could get a demo set up with you. I have some times tomorrow or Friday or Monday. What works best for you? What time tomorrow? I could do like a 2 o'clock Eastern tomorrow if that would work yeah yeah that's fine Thursday 2 o'clock Eastern so what I'll do let me email you a zoom and we can speak at 2 p.m. Eastern tomorrow alright sounds good perfect I'll get that over to you in a little bit okay thank you very much thank you we'll speak tomorrow Yes, sir. Bye-bye....
