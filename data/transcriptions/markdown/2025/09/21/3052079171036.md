## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Kirk. Hello, Kirk. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm doing good, Jim. How are you today? I'm pretty well. Wanted to follow up since we talked a week or two ago. Exchange an email, maybe a call, just to kind of check your interest, see if you had any next steps in mind or questions or anything at all. You know, I've kind of already got into this other software. At this point, I'm getting ready to launch a new business, and I don't want to make a change. you know, I've got to figure out how this works, and I've got it working now pretty good. So I'm going to stay where I'm at for now. Perfect. Well, give me a call if anything changes. What is that you're using, just out of curiosity? Whatever my assistant's doing. I can't remember what it's called, to be honest with you. I don't remember the name of it because she's the one that does most of the stuff with it. No worries. No worries. Well, anything else you need on my end, give me a call if you're back in the market. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye now....
