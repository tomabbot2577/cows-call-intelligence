**[1:12] Speaker_00:** So just look up any name.

**[1:14] Speaker_01:** it should be any it should be any name because it changed every single one of them um i think there were a few that weren't no like they were something different and next to their name it has a little um a little box i'm not really sure what that icon is supposed to be but it almost looks like a calculator or a i'm not sure what that little icon is okay let's see yes i'm seeing a company called Synergy Candidate next to most of the names here.

**[1:48] Speaker_01:** Okay.

**[1:49] Speaker_00:** Definitely.

**[1:50] Speaker_01:** So yesterday one of our employees noticed that it said Archer Western next to every single person in our database.

**[2:03] Speaker_01:** And so we don't know how that happened, if there was some weird glitch.

**[2:07] Speaker_01:** And Archer Western is one of the construction companies, And so it was on every single person's name in our entire database.

**[2:16] Speaker_01:** And so, yeah, one of the ladies changed.

**[2:20] Speaker_01:** She did something to change it, and she put, like, Synergy Professionals to try to fix it.

**[2:27] Speaker_01:** And so then I added somebody to see if they would be assigned Synergy Professionals, and they were.

**[2:34] Speaker_01:** But all the other people were still.

**[2:36] Speaker_01:** So I went in, and I clicked on that little icon.

**[2:39] Speaker_01:** What is that little icon?

**[2:40] Speaker_01:** It looks like a calculator or like a...

**[2:43] Speaker_00:** Is it a building?

**[2:44] Speaker_00:** Is that the one you're talking about?

**[2:45] Speaker_01:** Maybe it's a building.

**[2:46] Speaker_01:** Yeah, maybe it's a building.

**[2:47] Speaker_01:** But it's red.

**[2:49] Speaker_01:** Is it red when you're looking at it?

**[2:51] Speaker_01:** Yeah.

**[2:51] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[2:51] Speaker_01:** That's for a company icon.

**[2:53] Speaker_01:** I don't remember those ever being red.

**[2:56] Speaker_01:** I don't remember those ever being red.

**[2:58] Speaker_01:** So I clicked on one of those last night when I was working, and I went to the company at the bottom, and I changed it to Synergy Canada, which is what we wanted to say.

**[3:08] Speaker_01:** and I changed one person and it changed all of them, which I think is okay.
