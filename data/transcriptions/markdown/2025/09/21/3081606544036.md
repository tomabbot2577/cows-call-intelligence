## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm new to this program, and I need help with – I can bring up the timesheet information, but I can't print it in, like, a CVS file. Oh, okay. so you want to print out a timesheet. What's your name and what company are you with? I'm T. Green, and I'm with PVS Staffing. PV, sorry, say that again. PV what? PVS Staffing. Okay. Peter, Boyer, Sam, yes, Staffing. Got it. All right. So I'm going to open up your database here on my end. I'll just follow along here. All right. So if you go to, in the main menu, go to contract up at the top. Right. And then go to hours below that. And then choose the week you want to look at. Okay. So this is. Oh, sure. I want to actually a period. I don't want just a week. So, like, I need it from 7-23-2020 to, like, 7-23-2021. Is that possible? Oh, okay. Instead of week by week? Let me see here. Search date. Signed. Huh, interesting. Yeah, it's not – I don't think we – for some reason, we don't have a way to do beyond just a week by week. Let me go to some of these other tabs, though. Here we have assigned. It's showing me everybody that's been assigned currently. Is that available? All would be assigned and available. Okay. Are you looking for the timesheets for a specific person or just all timesheets in that time frame? All timesheets in that time frame because I'm meeting them for this workers' comp audit. And so this report shows me the client that they work for and the hours that they work and the location. So that's why I was trying to bring that up. Okay. I wonder if I can find a report. Yeah, let's see. Contract temp reports. Timesheet profit. Timesheet summary. Let's try this one. This is just a current week again. Filter. Okay. So I found a report that you can run where it will show the company name, the job title, the person who was placed at that company, so the candidate that was placed, their name, and the placement date. But beyond that, it doesn't have, like, the hours that they worked. The only way I could find, even in report... Oh, would that work? That's fine. The company, the job title, and the date. Yep, that's fine. Oh, okay. So to run that report... Because the job title is here. That's what I need. Okay. Oh, good. Okay. So, yeah, in the main menu of PCR, go to reports. And then see on the left, there should be a category called contract temp reports. If you're not seeing it, let me know. You might not have permissions turned on for your username to see those. I see company reports, name, position, pipeline reports, placement reports, auditing, EOC reports, contract temp reports. Yeah, Contract Temp Reports is the right category on the left. Okay. And then on the right? On the right, yeah, Contract Place Reports. Click on that, and you'll see under the first heading, it says Search Params. You'll have a date range that you can put on the right. And this would be – Oh, I'm sorry. Go back. Go back. Hold on. On the new Contract Place Reports? I was trying to write to contract place reports. That's what you say. Yeah, exactly. OK, got it. Right. And then select interview appointment date range should be on the right there for you where you're actually choosing the when it says interview appointment date. It means the date that they were placed since this is like a placement report. So you could put in that date range. I did see that and I was like, no, this is just an interview report, but okay. Yeah, it's just a funny name for it. Interview has to do with anything, any movement into a position. So that's fine. There are filters below under the heading that says filters. If you want to narrow it down by a certain company or a certain job or a certain person, those are available but they're optional you don't have to use them and then once you put in the date range you should see at the top right of your screen like three horizontal lines that says options if you hover over it would be probably underneath your profile picture okay okay yeah Yeah, but it's on the left. Oh, it's on the left. Now I see it's on the right. Okay, I can move it to the right. So click on options. Exactly. And it'll give you all the different ways to export it if you want to export it as an Excel file. Or if you just want to preview it, I always click on the one called PDF view mode. That'll show me like a preview of it before actually saving it as like an Excel file. Okay, so this is where I only can see the PDF view mode or help. There is no Excel. Oh, there isn't. If you click on the three horizontal lines there, it doesn't leave Excel. Okay. It might be that your permissions are turned off to export information. Let me double check that. Let's see. T green is your username. Okay. And oh, you should be able to... oh, you're not... yeah, your exporting reports is turned off. So you would probably need your system administrator, someone on your team to give you that permission. But I'm sup...
