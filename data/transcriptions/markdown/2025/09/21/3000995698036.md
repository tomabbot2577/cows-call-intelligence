## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi. Sorry, I didn't catch your name. Robin. Robin, how are you doing? This is Mark Anderson. I'm with Montgomery County in Ohio, and I just pulled out your file so I can give you, I guess, our account number here, if I can find it. Is there anything you would need from me? It's Business Services, Montgomery County. Services. Let me try this way. Job Bank Montgomery County? I'm sorry, what was that? Would it be Job Bank Montgomery County? Yes, it could be. Yes, we also go by that occasionally. So this is probably an old file name. Yeah, that's us. Okay. Okay. So my fiscal department, without giving me great information, notified me that last year's invoice, which is invoice 187-889. Let me pull that up. Hold on one second. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yes, we had We had an invoice for 19, wait, let's see. Oh, wait. Hold on one second. There's different ones here. Okay. Yeah, there was an invoice, and it looks like a partial balance. Yeah, that's where it's confusing because we have a purchase order for the exact amount of your invoice for the first of the year. Okay. What was that? What is this estimate? I never see estimate. Yeah, so you're, well, the estimate got revised along the way because there were things on there that, I don't know, I guess didn't, wasn't there, like some, I'm trying to remember now going way back. It looks like we had, so there was an invoice for $14,757, and then there was a payment for $12,000. So that's why there's 1924.92 open. Well, so when we did the estimate and we got the purchase order, Jim, who is our account executive, who is not really returning calls much, we determined we didn't need those users because that was wrong. Fifteen users at 75. There was only supposed to be 12, which is if it was done properly. Let me see if I can change that. Hold on one second. Let me look over to my bigger screen. only because it hides the edit on me if I'm on my screen. It rolls over too far. Okay, so let me see what it was billed for. It's 12 users. Maybe a sales tax. Okay. So there's a 10-8 service. Okay. So 12 users, 75. That was $10,800. The web extensions were another $600. The PCR mail is $1,432. And then just about discount on sales tax not collected. So the sales tax, obviously, being government, we don't do that. But what's your other charge? Because I don't have anything on any other charges. What was that called? Let me see here. I'm going to open this up again so I can compare what was in the estimate. I honestly have not really done estimates for customers. I'm semi-new to this. Yeah, no problem. It's estimate 1009, if that helps. Yeah, I saw it in there. I just want to see what's maybe in the estimate that's not in the final. Let me just see. I think Montgomery County. What is different in this estimate? Oh, can I see that? Okay, let me see. I'm going to have to go over here, view. okay so there's definitely a difference of this row about sales tax not collected but then it's applying tax discount on sales tax not collected oh okay so wait wait maybe i okay i think i see what's going on there okay so 12 32 okay so these are the same okay so So basically they apply the sale tax, but then they discount it. Discounted? Discount on sales tax not collected. I am going to have to ask about that. Oh, wait, no, because it's not a negative. So that's being added. So I've got the invoice that says zero sales tax, and that is correct. And the S that lines up. Yeah, so the actual invoice sent has where it's adding sales tax. I don't see it on my invoice that I approved, you know, internally. Yeah, that was probably just an estimate. No, it's your invoice. Well, so it's your invoice that you guys sent us. I have the estimate, which matches the exact invoice with no sales tax. So on December 13th of last year, he created the estimate of $12,832.80. It has no sales tax. I got a purchase order, sent it to him. I got the exact same bill that's marked invoice. Invoice 187889 matches everything. We paid that amount. And so the question is, what on your end is showing that must need to be credited or something out of your system? I might have to run this by our, what do you call it, our booking. We switched to a new billing system, and we have some of this more into bookkeeping. And I'm wondering if they adjusted because we were applying sales taxes to, like, Ohio, but she's been going in and switching to where it's based on county or Chicago. Maybe she just didn't know that you did not supposed to get this. So let me, can I run this by her? Yeah. Okay. Okay, and let me make sure I, okay, and I'm so sorry, what was your name again? I want to see if I have you in here. Yeah, sure, it's Mark Anderson. Okay, let me see if we have you in, okay, I got you. AndersonM at MCOhio.org, is that still a good email for you? That's perfect, yes. And then for phone number, what's the best number to reach you? 937-496-7610. okay that's one I have for you okay s...
