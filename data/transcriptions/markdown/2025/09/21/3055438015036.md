## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by your email address. I watched him leave. He didn't look packed up or anything. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon. Good morning. This is Jim. Hi, Jim. Good morning. How are you? I'm well. John, how are you? Good. All right. All right. So, yeah, thanks for joining me. I wanted to talk with you a little bit about PC Recruiter and kind of see what you've learned, what questions you have initially, or did you have any initial questions before we get started, kind of outline the process? yeah I mean I I did a little run-through with with our our our technology team and they showed me the system it seems pretty intuitive I've used many a test systems in the past so I'm kind of used to how the databases work and so forth so they're all they'll have their their their quirks and they're the way they work the different things so it's just something I would have to dive into to learn but you know how customizable is it I guess it is very customizable so since you've had experience with these you kind of know the basics of how they work and how they look and everything like that um it's very configurable so what fields show where you can add in custom templates custom sequences email templates and stuff like that and the The nice thing about dimensional search is they pre-populate the database with a lot of customizations that are based around their training. So we have a specific template that is more than what a standard PC recruiter customer would get that would kind of give you a lot of stuff that they have used over the years and kind of developed. So they give you a custom template, and then you can change it on your own. And the training that we give you trains you how to do that if you want to tweak it or you think it would look better this way or that way or anything like that. Okay. Okay. And it integrates fully with all their systems. I know that. Does it integrate with LinkedIn as well if I decide to do that in the future? Yeah. Well, what it'll do with LinkedIn, our capture app will allow you to pull people in from LinkedIn. So you can pull a record right in with one click. It'll then create a record, import their photo, import a copy that is searchable of their summary. So you can do that. There's also a way to share jobs on LinkedIn that you can have people route back to your website to apply. So that'll work as well. So there's a couple different ways you can work with that. And then, of course, it'll integrate with HireEasy, ZoomInfo, RingCentral, all of those there too. Okay. I mean, is there anything that you think I need to know from my standpoint? Not really. Just what I'm going to share with you just kind of about the setup and everything like that. They give a great demo and they really do a good job of kind of giving an overview of it. And then the added benefit is that when you get set up on PC Recruiter, you have 10 hours of training with our trainers here. And then you also have full training with Dimensional Search. So our trainer would be a person that would get just started. They give you two to three sessions before you even go to your Dimensional Search training. And are you in the October class? Yeah, I'm in the October class. Yeah, so what they'll do, that gives us a good month to get everything in, but they will go through and you'll have your PC recruiter trainer, you'll work with the same person each time, and they'll give you two to three sessions before that point. They'll get you up and running in the system, show you how to create it, how to customize it, how to add users, how to do a lot of the configuration and the setup and everything like that. then dimensional search will pick up and they'll train you more on the recruiting side how to utilize pc recruiter in their version tips and tricks and then they'll kind of hand you back over to our trainer for a couple more sessions so they kind of balance each other and you essentially have two companies working with you to get your train on the system so like i said 10 hours training included and that uh the pricing i'm sure they told you 750 setup that's just a one-timer that includes setup and creation of the database, assistance hooking up any of the integrations you want to use, setting up like the capture piece, hooking it into your website, all of that. And then you're also going to be having those 10 hours. So you get the 10 hours training included in that. And then $50 per user per month. I would assume most people are just one user. Is it just you for now? For now, it's just me. Yeah, that price was surprising at the cost of per user, which is great. I might expand users for this tool, which would be great at $50,000. Yeah, they make it really very easy to do that. And when you add a user, it doesn't reset the contract. It doesn't change anything. You can just add a user, drop a user with a quick email...
