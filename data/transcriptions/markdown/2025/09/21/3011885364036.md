## 💬 Full Transcript

 Call has been forwarded to voicemail. Please leave a message after the tone. Good morning, Paul. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. Hedged out for a demo today at 10 a.m., and I dialed in and waited for quite a little bit, and you didn't dial in, so it looks like we've missed each other. So I wanted to reach out and see about getting perhaps a reschedule a little bit later today or certainly next week. I'm very open next week, so that would work just as well, if not better. Please give me a call. Let me know how I can get that reschedule for you. I'll drop you an email in a couple minutes as well. 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks, sir. I'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye....
