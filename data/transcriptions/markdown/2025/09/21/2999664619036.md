## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Sean Reeves. Hey, Sean, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? I'm good. How are you today? I am real well. I'm real. I called you. I had a couple of things to ask you about. Did you have a couple minutes? Yeah, go ahead. I replied to your email, so I was glad to hear back from you. I know you said you're not the technical guy, but I did hear back from someone that answered some of the questions. So you go ahead and shoot. What is it? Awesome. Yeah, I think Drew answered some questions. So initially, with regard to that data, the best thing about how we do it is that we don't do the – basically, we don't procure the data you're going to move. You do. That way you make sure that it's only going to be what you want them, and we won't release it until you sign off again once we move it to the database, and you can make sure only things in that database are what you want to give them. We can assist with how to find back to a certain date or anything like that, which I think you might have already done since I think they're already on roll-up lists. Yeah, what I did is since it's only name records, company records, and I'm assuming that if I had a bunch of positions in there, it would also move positions. But all of the positions, I didn't even make a roll-up of those because it's not germane anymore because all the positions have been filled and they're sort of legacy at this point in time. Okay, yeah, because you would need to make a separate roll-up list of positions and you could do that, but if you don't do it, then it doesn't matter. They will copy and do that. Okay. So it's just names. They don't type into them. Whatever names I put on there, I search by date entered. And Drew did, well, same for companies, date entered. And what Drew said is that, as soon as Drew Rothman, is like, if you put any notes in for a company or added additional, well, not names, but if you put a note in or other things after the 9th, it will go with that record. He said, I can help on the back end, or I can show you how to remove those to make sure those nodes, or we can do it on the back end. Is that right to you? Yeah, yeah. Well, I think the best thing to do, you sent in that request to have the new database created, and we're going to call it custom concrete. Then once that's done, which it should be maybe tomorrow, I don't even know. I've got like 15 emails since I last looked at it. Mackenzie's going to create that, email it to you, and what's going to happen is you'll want to copy, not move, copy those roll-up lists over into this new custom concrete database. And if you want me to help you, or Drew, either of us can get on the phone and kind of walk you through it. Then, once we copy it into the database, Drew should be able to then help you in that database kind of pull out anything more recent, anything that you don't need to go over, anything like that. So then we'll be working only in the custom concrete. So if we delete stuff out, it's not being deleted out of your database, so it's all good. And then once you're satisfied that, yes, this data is only what they need to get, then we can get your sign-off. Then I'll put in a ticket and move it over to them. Okay, got it. So I'm copying, not – it's not cut and paste. It's duplicate or copy it. Yeah, you're going to go to your roll-up list, and one of the menu items, you hit select all, and then you say copy to another database. And then you're going to copy it to another one. So you'll still keep everything. You'll just make an exact copy. And then you can kind of delete out newer stuff or work with Drew because Drew might be able to even go write some SQL statements to do anything more recent than a certain date or anything like that. So I will keep an eye out. I should be cc'd on that. But if you happen to get that email from Mackenzie that that database is created, let me know. And then we can schedule a time to talk and get that done. The other thing was I had you on a trial for the AI, and it's been a few more weeks than I should have given to you, but had you used it? Did you want to keep it? Did you want to not keep it? What were you thinking? You know what? Honestly, I totally forgot you gave it to me. I played with it a little bit and didn't see that. My short answer is you've got to keep working on it. There are things that I have to cut and paste, but it's not quite as robust as some of the other things I'm using. and I didn't really spend much more time with it just to go, I think what I'm doing is working better than this right now. Sure, sure. Yeah, I mean, if you want to give me another week, really all it was was on some of the records you'd get that symbol where you could actually use the AI, but it didn't have a ton of functionality yet to me. I hope that's something that you guys are working on and making improvements in, because that's something that would be extremely powerful, even if it costs more money. The biggest thing they'...
