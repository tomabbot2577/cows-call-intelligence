 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Hello, Jim. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Ryan. How are you? I am doing excellent, my friend. Give me one moment. I was just finishing an email, and I'll literally two seconds, and I'll get right back to you. Is that okay? Absolutely. Absolutely. Take your time. Yep. Just literally the one minute I'm done with this, just have to finish this. Okay. I apologize about that. I didn't want to be late to your meeting, but I had to send that out. So thank you so much for your patience. For sure. For sure. No problem. Glad we could connect. Yeah. So I wanted to kind of introduce us. I'm with PC Recruiter. We are the software that you get with dimensional search. And just a little word about what happens and everything. I think you saw a demo. They probably showed you a little bit of PC Recruiter. You're familiar roughly with what we do? A little bit. It looks fairly easy to use. Yeah. Some of the icons and stuff is a little early 2000s, but that's okay as long as it's easy to use and it gets you to where you need to go. That's all I'm looking for here. And that is – we know that, and we actually have a little bit of a different newer version that Dimensional Search is in the process of kind of moving people slowly over to, and so it may change. It may be upgraded too. Honestly, if it's easy to use, like the switch from regular Salesforce to Salesforce Lightning, you know, back in, you know, when that was introduced was like pulling hair out for me. So if the original is easy to use, let's just keep at that, man. They both are pretty simple. They look a little different, but this is the version now. And this version, they've been training on it for quite a while. Our team's been training on it for quite a while. So and the beauty of that is, is you get two full organizations supporting you and getting you trained on PC Recruiter. So with the purchase of us, you get 10 hours training with a dedicated trainer here at PC Recruiter. So they would cover, I think they usually will do a couple of hours prior to your dimensional search training. And are you in the October class or are they pushing to November this time? I am in the October class, right? So I'm drinking from a fire hose right now. I signed my franchise agreement like in early September. So I'm just, you know, sign up for this, do this, grab this. So, yeah. Yeah, so that's the sixth. So still have time, still have time. So what would happen? So on today's call, what I'll do is I'm going to collect your company name, your street address, your contact info, and I can email you over the paperwork to get signed up. It comes in a Panda doc, basically just a different name brand for DocuSign. And take a look at that. once you're ready to go you can sign it that'll come back to me then I countersign it and then I have my my accounting team sent over the invoice for the setup and first month set up up 750 first month of $50 and are you one user for now are you going to be more one user for now and we're looking to hire an SDR probably within the first 90 days so once that is the case you know we may be adding more users to that life and it happens all the time and we are very flexible you can add a new user it doesn't affect the contract you just add a new user as long as you need them you can drop them just as simply so no problems there so once everything is signed and paid within a day or two you're going to have your link emailed to you so that would be your database link that you would use to access and and also at that time they would assign a trainer my training team assigns one of our trainers I then reach out to get an intro call set up between you me and the trainer they have a few questions to go over and then on that call they're going to schedule you about two sessions that's what dimensional search likes us to get you two sessions in before you're meeting with them so we've got a couple weeks to get that in so that shouldn't be a problem and they'll go over the basic setup of PC recruiter create usernames a lot of the basics there and then when you go to dimensional search you'll have a base for the system they will then expound on that train you in more recruiting and more kind of a little bit different area but also with PC recruiter and then they'll hand you back over to my training team here so they kind of play off one another and kind of build you as we go which is which is nice I lost you there for a second what was that they kind of trade you off and build up as you go so you have a couple hours with the PC recruiter trainer then you go to your session with dimensional search and they have a schedule that they follow so then they'll go ahead and PC recruiter trainer knows where to pick up and what to go over next so they'll be able to Okay.
