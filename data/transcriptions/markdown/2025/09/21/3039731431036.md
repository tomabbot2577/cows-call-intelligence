## 💬 Full Transcript

 Chris Spahn. Hi, Chris. It's Jim with PC Recruiter returning your voicemail. Hello, Jim. How are you? I'm all right. So I wanted to ask a couple questions, Jim. I'm in a very positive position that my business has literally grown 400% since last year with a number of new clients, et cetera. So at age 74, it's a nice position to be in and actually a little bit unexpected. But in this business, 100 things can go sideways with different deals or whatever, and everything has come together quite nicely. So that's the good news. The challenge is that, again, at age 74, I've got to be realistic with myself that I'm just not going to take the time to utilize PCR the way it should be utilized. And so what I wanted to explore with you is a couple of options. I'm going to be hiring a part-time independent contractor recruiter to help me. Is there any way that I would be able to, you know, I would pay the monthly invoice, but I never use it? Is there some way where I could provide the rights of usage to that to another individual? You could. You could. So what you could do, since our users aren't really named specific, if you're paying for one user and you're not really logging in, which you're not, I see your username hasn't logged in since March of 2025. What you could do is you could let that assistant use the admin user, and that's the second user that's included no charge. So if we see that logging in in addition to your username, it's still going to be as one user. Well, I mean, that's absolutely perfect. I mean, I couldn't hope for it being any better. So in other words, once I get this recruiter on track, you'd be able to tell me or your customer service people could instruct me how she would go into the system to get in there. Well, she would just go in. I don't know the password to it. So you'd have to go in and just she would log in under admin and then know the admin password. If you don't have it, let me know and I can send you a password reset form and we can put in a ticket once that's signed and have the password reset and go through a whole process. Yeah, and that's probably a good idea just because I haven't been using it. Let me just see out of curiosity whether I might be able to find the information here. Let me see. It might have been the original email that my admin sent to you when they created it. Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah, let me do a little work on that. But now that you have confirmed that I can have another person use the system, then it will be put to good use. Yeah. And so the second option becomes a moot point. We don't need to look at the second option because that's my preferred way of proceeding. Yeah, you should be able to do that, no problem. Just let us know if you have any questions on it when it's time. But, yeah, that person can use admin. And since you're not using your username, you're still one paid user, no problem. Perfect. Okay, thank you, Jim. I'll keep you posted. Very well. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
