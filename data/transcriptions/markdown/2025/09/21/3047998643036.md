## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Brian. Hey, Brian. My name is Yolanda Cookson, and I am calling with PE Consulting, and I am working with a new employee that is working on trying to get into PCR, and it's completely disappeared for us. Like, we're trying to install. We have to reinstall it again, and it's kind of sending us through this loop to launch it. And we've tried every extension. Yeah. We can't even access it, though. We don't have, like, the desktop icon. It's nothing. It's gone. Okay. So there's no – so PCR is an online solution, so you just access it through your browser. Okay. so you just go to your url got it got it okay i think that's what the problem was do you know what your your pcr url is yes okay because if you don't just got on there no okay great i haven't been here for a year or so so i'm having a moment and now it looks very different. So now we've learned. Thank you, Brian. We'll be good now. I just needed to know how to turn on the computer. Thank you for helping me. No worries. Have a great day. You too. Bye....
