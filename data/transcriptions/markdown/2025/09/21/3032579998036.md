## 💬 Full Transcript

 My main sequence, this is Robin. Hi, Robin. Good morning. My name is Mikhail, and I am from Kronos Consulting, a user of PC Recruiter. So my issue is I'm not able to log in successfully to PC Recruiter today. And whenever it is successfully logged in, I always encounter the error of PC Recruiter being logged out. So maybe we can check on this. you might need to go to whoever maintains your database. Let's see. You're with Kronos Consulting. Is that correct? Yep. Okay. Check the database. See maybe some of the credentials you're logging in it. We cannot do anything about password or things like, or security. So, but I'm not sure if this has something to do with it, but I, yeah, let me, yeah, if it's locked, if it's locked out, it could be that, You have something connecting the PC Recruiter with maybe your username, but it's got the wrong password. So let me see. I don't think that's the issue because at times I'm able to log in, but it automatically logs me out. And I'm not sure if... So you're saying it's disabled or... I mean, that's two different messages. Do you know a username that's a full administrator? No, it's just... Yeah, I'm not a full, I don't have full administration apps. Do you know who does, like what their username would be? Because normally there's like an admin account. I could peek that. Oh, wait, I missed a letter. Hold on one second. I don't know the username. Hold on. Okay, one moment. One moment. Let me just check. It was, I'm just typing something here real quick. Let's see. Let me check something. Okay. Okay, so you're logged in. So you're not getting that you're locked out, right? Yeah, I am. That's not the issue. Okay, so I thought that's what you said. Okay, so what are you experiencing then? so earlier when i was logging in i am automatically being logged out and i'm getting the error message that pc recruiter is automatically logged out after a number of minutes oh okay and then right and then right now as i'm trying to log in it just won't go through okay so one thing could be you have different IP addresses, which would cause a logout. Let me get a list of the ones that you've used today. Hold on one second. So I was actually about to tell you that I changed internet providers today. Oh, okay. So does that have something to do with it? It could be, yeah. Do you know what your IP address is right now? Let me double check that. I've seen a few being used for you. So your new network, it looks like they do change. It's possible that they change IP addresses because it's definitely changed several times today. Let me double check, okay? Yeah, that'll help. All righty. Well, obviously, I'm going to my computer settings. Is it the IPv4 address that you need? Yeah, you can just go like, what's my IP? And it usually tells you to. It's like a website. Oh, okay. That's one way to tell. Oh, you don't have a time zone selected. What's your time zone? you follow every zone a time zone that could also cause an issue too so Arizona the one like doesn't that doesn't change correct yes okay let me set that because that could definitely be an issue as well your username did not have any time zone selected so it's kind of running off eastern time zone which would cause a conflict that could be one thing but you also have this IP address issue. Okay. Do you want an IP address right now? I have it. Yeah. What is my IP address? Okay. IPv4 says 112.20. Okay. Is it NN115? No. Okay. It ends in 130. 130. Okay. That's another one then. 1 1 2 is it the 203 107 like what I don't let me list that one too let's see what you might need to do is check with whoever your new provider is and tell them you need a static IP address. Otherwise, this can be an ongoing issue. Can you go ahead and try logging into PC Recruiter now? Because one thing I did do is change your time zone. That could be an issue, but I also want to see exactly what... So I just tried and it won't go through. It just won't log in. Okay. So I guess it's an issue with my new internet provider. Yeah. Okay, what's the newest one that you said? 112. 112, 203. Okay. 104. Okay. 130. 130, okay. I'm going to try whitelisting some of these but you could have an issue if it's going to keep going on. Let's see. I'm going to go ahead and put these in there. It looks like you've had some other ones for your database before. Okay. Let's do this. Let's have you close Chrome or at least close PC Recruiter window. Go back to Chrome and try it now. Let's see if this helps. One sec. So I'm trying it now. Okay, it successfully logged in. Let me just see if it will automatically log me out. Let me just go around and open some profiles. The other thing that you might want to do as well, I think it's probably mainly this IP address and the time zone. But the other thing that will help with out being logged out is you're using Chrome. Yep. If you go up to the top right of Chrome and go to those three vertical dots, go to settings. Okay. Go to performance. Okay. ...
