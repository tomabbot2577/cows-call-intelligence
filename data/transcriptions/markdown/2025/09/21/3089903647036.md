## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. How are you today? Good. How are you? Good. So this is Mark Goodstein with TechPros. And I'm calling to talk about something to see if it's something that I can fix. in the summary section that I have in the name record. For some reason, when it populates, I don't know how it's populating it, but it's populating a background on the person, but it comes in one long string, all on one line. Oh, okay. I don't know how to fix that. Let's see. So I'll only jump into your database to take a look here. Do you have an example of maybe a name record that's having this issue? Yeah, so take a look at Julia Aversa. Julia Aversa. Summary, there it is. Okay, yeah, I see it's just all online. Okay. Okay. So there was an update to the software where the summary area is now, it has like that toolbar where it's not just plain HTML. You can use fonts and things like that. So maybe during the conversion, some of those were adjusted. I do have a tech team member has an adjustment they can make to your database to revert that back to the older summaries display. If that would help, you would just lose the ability to do general toolbar formatting on your summaries, like the font changes and things like that. It would just revert back to the old way. so I'm so and also just so I know because I just upgraded to PCRM I just haven't had training yet um has and I and they said something that my database was going to be updated do you know if my database was updated oh uh I can show on I haven't since I haven't had the training I'm still on PCR 9 oh okay um let's see let me check your tickets related to your company tech pros. Okay. Gotcha. Okay. So they did turn that on. Here, let me just email you a link so that you can – it's just a different link that you go to, a different website to log into PCRM. It is the same database. It just has a different interface or a different, you know, face to it. So let me get you that website. No, you know what? I have that already. Oh, you got it? Okay. I'm just waiting to have training. Get assigned to training. Okay. To get assigned to trainer. You know what? I think I'm going to leave this alone. What I'll do is I'll just delete it and re-add it in. Okay. As you go. As I go. It'll look better in PCRM. I think we made that update to PCR9 to make it talk to PCRM better. So everything will have that formatting ability and that toolbar. So they won't display the same way in PCRM with that long string. It'll look more digestible as a chunk of text. Got it. That sounds great. Awesome. Anything else you've been having trouble with? Just, you know, I had filed a ticket. Hold on a sec here. While I've got you on the phone, I should ask. Sure. Hold on. I filed a ticket. I filed a couple of tickets with hold on a sec. All right. So I sent an email to Jim Lombardi Lombardo, excuse me, this morning. you know I had shown him that when you're in when you're in the pipeline section no excuse me that's something else when you're in LinkedIn and you're using the the capture I'm sorry what the capture tool when you're using the capture tool What happens is, obviously, you can customize that tool. And I have it customized so that I can pull up a roll-up list. And what it does is it populates the four latest roll-up lists that I must have tried to log into in PC Recruiter. but I was showing Jim that if I'm using, like now I'm doing a new search and I'm doing a search for another position and I look up the roll-up list once, it should populate that in that roll-up list in LinkedIn. Oh, in the drop-down. Okay, I see what you're saying. And it doesn't. It's very annoying. Gotcha. I have to keep searching for the same I have to keep – so now I'm doing a search. I always do my searches in serial. I'm looking for a dog walker, and I'm reaching out to 25 dog walkers, right? So every single time I find someone and I try to attach them to the roll-up list, I have to look up the roll-up list every single time. I feel it should populate with the one that I just used. Okay. There is maybe a workaround. I think it should show in that drop-down list. Don't you agree? Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, the latest one you've been using repeatedly. But there is maybe a workaround that can help with that and speed things up for you where when you go to edit your capture tool layout, where you were able to add in that add to roll-up group itself, on that edit screen, you can choose a roll-up that is selected by default. So you might want to just for like this week have, like for your example, How do I do that now? So how do I do that? Okay, perfect. Yeah. So go to a LinkedIn profile and at least, you know, start the capture process so that we can get to the edit to capture layout button at the top right the capture tool okay I'm in the capture tool yep okay so yeah top right there's that little pen and paper edit icon yep and then where you...
