## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me in sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Danielle at Community Rehab. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. I was like, she probably won't answer, but I'm like, I don't know how else to get someone in tech support other than email. I'm like, I'll give it a shot. So I'm trying to remove a placement from a job, and I've removed a bunch of others earlier, but this one is not removing, and I don't get it. Okay. Let me see here. What's going on here? And it does this occasionally, and then I'm like, oh, I'll just open a new tab, and then it's okay. And it works, but that didn't work this time. What's your username? D. Dooner. Community Rehab. what is the position that you're in um do you have the position of the person the position because you got to delete it from the right i just click on pipeline from the therapist name is the easiest way for me to make sure i'm on the right one oh okay i always go from the position I mean we've got so many jobs and there's some people with similar or same names in different places we have working with us so I always go to who it is um it's Shelby S-H-E-L-B-Y and the last and oh yeah okay all right let's see but when I click on move to out of process and I go to the resigned and termed I click on it but literally her placement's still there I'm like I don't get this why is it removing it for me click on the placement card which opens up the placement you got all the different steps in there uh-huh yeah and then I just go and then delete at the bottom right I just click on her placement and do right click and do move to out of process and then I go down to the resign slash termed okay so are you usually removed okay so are you so well are you trying to delete her out of the pipeline or are you trying i'm trying to delete her placement just a placement record i don't want to remove all the steps i just want to do it where again the option to move out of process so it takes her out of the active placements but doesn't remove the stuff from her record does that make sense? So if you go to edit name, if you're in her name record, go over to pipeline and then expand her steps, which shows she's got one, two, three, seven steps. Click on the one that says permanent. That's her placement record. Okay. And then that opens up the placement. Click delete down at the bottom right? Yeah, it's still not doing it. It says it did, but it's not. Like it's weird. It's still there. All right, I'm going to try it. So I did that part. So when I look at activity, it's showing pipeline resign term, but she's still showing as a placement in the pipeline. That could be based on dates. Let me see if I can delete this. I sure want to delete this placement. Okay. Placement has been deleted. It has because it's still showing. Yeah. Did you get a pop-up asking you to confirm that it was being deleted? Oh, wait. Now when I just went back, it's, I usually do, but I did, I did. Oh, you did. Okay, because it didn't do it for me. And I did a bunch of other ones today too, and this was the only one that wasn't working. When you click delete, did you get that confirmation banner up at the top? On her? No, I usually do. It usually says, you know, I'm sure you – whatever. Yeah, so that's why. What you might want to do, if it continues to be an issue, if you clear the cached images and files in your browser. Okay. I went and did it, and it was fine. So if you click delete and you didn't get that pop-up, which is like the confirmation, like are you sure you want to delete this? Right. Like it did with everybody else, but like hers for some reason wasn't working. Like I literally just did like three other ones and they were fine, but hers didn't work. So I don't know why, but, you know. Yeah, not sure why they didn't pop up. Yeah, if it continues to be an issue, maybe like close your browser and go back in or something like that. Yeah, I tried that. It usually works and it just didn't this time. So I'm not sure why. Yeah, it looks like she's got now the link name and then some activities in between. Not steps, but activities. And then the resign term. Right. So, yeah, I don't know. But, okay. Sounds like you didn't get that pop-up for some reason. Yeah. Occasionally it's done that recently and I don't know why and it drives me bonkers. because I'm like, all right, so I close like all the tabs, I open a new one, then sometimes it works and sometimes it's like multiple times I do it and then it finally works. So there's like no rhyme or reason at this point. Yeah, what you may want to do, if you go, are you using Chrome? Yes. Go to the top right of Chrome where you've got those three. And do my history. When you go to delete browsing data, select all time, but only delete cached images and files. Oh, okay. yeah you don't need to delete anything else just cached images and files okay all right i'll give it a shot if it gives me any more problems but i did all the ones i needed to ...
