## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. It's Danielle Stewart from Q-Pharma. Hi, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Oh, pretty good. Let me pull up your stuff here. All right. What was yours? You had, okay. So your billing account goes to finance at Q-Pharma Corp. Exactly. Q-Pharma Corp.com. Okay. So have you, we need to clarify which card we have in file. Okay. Right now you have 2722. 2722. Hold on one second. And then 2722. All right. Let me just get this one. No, that's not mine. Okay. And so there's a charge for $99 a month. Do we know what that is? Let me look up your other things. Yeah, 9909, that is for one-user ASP services, the cloud. Like basically one-user piece recruiter services. So it's 95 a month plus that small PPI increase after the first year. So it totals $99.09. Just to use the service, to use the database. Correct. Has that always been something we've been charged for? To use PC Recruiter? Yes. Okay. I don't know. My accountant is questioning me, and obviously I don't get involved in any of this stuff. It's not even my credit card. Okay. All right, that's all. I think that answers my question. It's just like the monthly fee for me to be able to use the database. Yeah, right now you're licensed for one user on the account. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. You are welcome. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye....
