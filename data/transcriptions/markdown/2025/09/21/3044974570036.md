## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Good morning, Lenine. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. How are you? Good. How are you, Jim? I am well. I had you down for 10 a.m., and I dialed into the Zoom, and I waited a little bit, so I thought I'd give you a quick call, see if it still worked for you. I'm on it now, and you're still on it. I was like, damn it. I even perfectly accepted this morning, and I was like, oh, my gosh. I must have just popped out of the call because I'm still in the meeting. I just hung up the call, and it must have been the second you joined in. So that's so funny. So are you able to pop back on or no? We can just stay on this call. The Zoom's still here. I can share the screen if we need to. So that'll work. Okay, cool. So yeah, so I wanted to just kind of show you on PC Recruiter a bit. I wanted to see kind of what you were looking to see or what initial questions you had. I think you said you were an app looking to maybe offer this as an integration point or something. Correct. So basically what I'd be looking for is, number one, is it at a price point? Could we figure something out where it would be at a price point that would make sense? Or how does it normally work when people are doing the API integration? You kind of tell me how that's worked in the past and what prices they would be. Okay. Well, list prices for our system are about $1.15 per user per month. Now, we might be able to work a little bit cheaper than that, but they would need to have a PC recruiter account in order to essentially click on an API. So we do have an open API, so something could be written. And many times clients would write something to our API we don't even know about it. And so it's relatively simple to do, but they would need to have an account. We'd need to see, I don't handle our partnerships. I have another guy on staff here who handles the details of those. It kind of works a lot more with that. Well, why don't you show me? I'll tell you a little bit about us first. So my husband and I developed an app. We're going to have a series of apps that are basically the same thing, the premise, but they're highly specialized for the marine business, basically. So the first one that's out is marine service companies, and the next one will be specifically for yachts. So that would be charter, that would be yacht broker management, et cetera. But just on this side, the reason why he wanted to develop this app, he actually started it in 2007, believe it or not. The reason why is because there wasn't anything for his companies that made sense. Like, it was just too hard to try to get it normal, normal apps or even software before apps was just software, right? They were designed where a person or an address was the file. In the marine business, a lot of times you don't even have that. You have a yacht, and that's all you're dealing with. Like, let's say you're the certified outboard for a Suzuki servicer, right? you're just doing 100-hour, 500-hour services repeatedly. So it's the only difference is the actual boat or the motor. So that's really why it's really hard in the marine industry to find software programs that work for you because you're just making shit up. You know what I mean? Like there is no Mrs. Jane Smith and whatever. But anyway, that's our back story. and that's why actually I'd be interested on twofold. One would be just for his company, which is Rock Solid Yacht Services, and if it works and it was something that was truly great for their company, then it would be something that we would be interested in to offer other people inside the app. So that's kind of where we come from. So if you want to walk me through what it looks like and how I could visualize this, I'm a visual person, how I can visualize how it would help. Sure. And you're looking to kind of track hires and candidates and positions and job openings and stuff like that? Correct. Yep. Okay. Perfect. Perfect. Yeah. Let me share my screen and kind of show you around just the basics of how this will work. I'm also going to show you two different interfaces because we actually have the PC Recruiter Classic, which is what we're looking at right now. It's been around a number of years, used by thousands of recruiters in every industry. We also have a newer PCRM is what it's called. So it's more of a CRM product, but it has all of the ATS products, like the tracking features of it as well. So it is basically an ATS, which it's got a newer interface, so it's kind of a nice thing to look at. So I'll show you the two side-by-side, or actually I'll kind of open them up both and kind of see which one you might like to better explore. Okay. Since you're kind of visually taking a look at these here. So this is the basic classic PC recruiter. It's going to be something that is going to run on a PC or a Mac. There's a mobile app, too. And you can access all of your information. Main menu bar at the top. Middle area is going to be for searching, search results or lists. Its bot...
