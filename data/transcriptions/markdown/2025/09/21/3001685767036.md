## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me at Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Bob Levitt with Brandon Becker. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Quick question. I haven't done a sequence in a long time, and I don't want to screw up. When I'm sending it to their work phone number, is it – I forgot what it was. Excuse me, to their work email. Is it email for work or work email? Oh, okay. Let me log into your database and see. So you have email underscore work is a field that PCR already has loaded into all databases, but you might have made a custom field called email work or something similar. Yeah, because I have both. I'm looking at a candidate's record right now and I have both. But sometimes, like, let's say I had your email and I had it in your working, but you're a prospective client, I would copy that and put that in the email address line above it as well. But I don't know if I had that done for all of them. So I'd rather probably use work email. I just want to know if I do that, I'm okay. Okay. Let's see. Yes. So the work email is the custom one. You have your custom one that you've created on your record layouts. So that would mean it's the one called work email, not the one with the underscore. Okay, but let's say in the future, everybody that I have their work email, I copy and paste it to the email address. If I wanted to use that one, that's yours. The work email is my custom one, you're saying. Exactly. So, yeah, if you copy to the one called email address, that field is called email address. And that would be to select the email. It would be email underscore work or just email. but which one would I select as far as the send to when I'm doing the sequence? It would be, yeah, send to email address if you've copied everything over to the email address field. Correct. That one, yes. But right now, yeah. Like today it's working. Okay. Yeah, right now you would do the work email one. but copy over to the email address eventually so that you can use the email address one. Okay. And then if I have a standard second follow-up email that I wanted to copy and paste into that sequence, because again, I don't do sequences often. Can you log into my thing real quick? I think I'm okay. I just want to add a letter. Okay. So you have a sequence template that you're working on currently? I just created it called Second Attempt Regarding Liran, L-I-R-A-N. Okay. Go ahead and hit save on that at the top right, and then I'll be able to see what you've been working on. Okay. And I didn't even put the letter in yet. I just selected 99 people I want to send a follow-up to today, but I just want to get the sequence right. Let's see. And you know what? It might actually be easier if we just jump on a screen share. All right. I'll do that for you real quick because I haven't done this in a while. So what would that be again? Would it be RingCentral? Ring central, yep, and I'll give you a meeting ID whenever you're ready. Okay, I am. Okay, that's 850-594-241. Perfect. Okay, I'm going to hang up the phone. Yep. Okay. Hi....
