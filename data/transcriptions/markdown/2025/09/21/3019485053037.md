## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Scott speaking. Can you hear me? Okay. Can you hear me? Yes, I can hear you now. Okay. I don't know what happened there. All right, let me move my mouse around here. Okay. Too many wires. Okay. so when we switched you over to our new billing like yeah which was kind of like end of March beginning of April what we did is we switched people from sales receipt which was not probably the best way to handle things but they didn't have really have auto pay so it's really it was going on it's like yeah we had a card stored and was sending you a receipt but the transaction wasn't being processed for a period of time there it's like probably like literally checking one box that was overlooked so that's kind of what it's probably just very manual to do things that way which is one of the reasons why we upgraded the system so i know you wrote your message like till today your actual your recent ones actually were paid the ones since march so it's just the ones that remember okay did it come under a different name because we looked in our credit cards and didn't see it. Let's see. Let me see here. Okay. Sleep solution. Yeah. It might be a different card than was stored. Let me see if I can tell. Yeah, tell me the last four. Here, the last four are fine. for, let's see, April, May, June, and July have all processed. Yeah. And, hold on one second because I've got two places I have to look this up now. So now they are processing with a card. Let's see. Oh, I'm going to go this way. Here with me one second. Okay. So right now they're processing with a card ending in 6801. That is correct. Okay. But I haven't seen them, and it's for 190? Your previous ones were 190. Let's see. Why is that different there? Invoice 190. Hold on one second. Let me see here. invoice, invoice. Yeah, your amounts are $190. Okay. Yeah, so your recent ones, I mean, they're showing as paid. So these should all be fine. So let me look up one of the last ones I have. Yeah, the last one was on July 11th of 2025. I don't think I have my July statement yet. The last statement I'm seeing, hold on, let me do a search. Our controller sends them to me. And the last statements I have from him are from May. So I need to ask him for the July statements. They come at the end of the month for us. Okay. It will be the end of June, but let me open up the May one for the 6-8-0-1. Now, that one was in May. It was May 15th. Now, that one was 2-15 because then it was a late charge on that one. Yeah, there was like a little extra charge on that one because when did they do that, though? May 15 was 215. Okay, and let me go back because I had our office administrator look at these. Yeah, she didn't see that one on there. So let me go now to our April statement. Because even I looked at these last night and I didn't see them. And you know what it was for me? I was looking at, I believe I was looking at an earlier date, not the 15th. Yeah, there's nothing on my credit card showing for the 15th. Of what month? April 15th. April 15th. Okay, so the April and May invoices were probably paid a little bit later. Let's see. Because they were invoices. Yeah, and I'm looking for 190. Yeah, there was a payment in May, another payment ended, and then two payments at the end of June. Oh, two payments for the end of June. Yeah, so you had your April and May invoices that were sent with the new system, but only one payment was made on May 15th, and that was applied to your April. So you kind of were like one month behind, and then when you made two payments at the end of June, that meant you were current for those ones generated from the new system. and then what dates do you have for those? Those payments were made June 25th yeah and they were $190 yeah those were $190 and one was $215 those were for your May and June invoices so you made two payments in June one for May one for June okay so now the question is is that I remember making those payments now that you, at least the ones in June. But did those come as an email to me saying, hey, click here to pay it? Yes. So that was from our, so we, what we did is anybody that used to be a sales receipt, because that was a horrible setup, but apparently for invoices, there was no auto pay. So what's happening is basically you were getting a receipt when it was kind of like an auto pay before, before a card was even attempted. And so we always had to like chase people down like, oh, your card was declined or it didn't process, like it expired. So it was a real pain. So now with this new system, we can have everybody on an invoice and you can now have that view and pay option. so i believe what probably happened is when you got major payment in june it set you up for auto pay which is why your june your july 11th invoice was sent and then it processed that day so you're really back on auto pay now in our new system it's just that when you were first getting those invoices you probably didn't like go in right away or set up aut...
