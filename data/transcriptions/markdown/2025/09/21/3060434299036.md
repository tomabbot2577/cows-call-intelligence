Thank you. you Hi, Laura. Hi, Jim. How are you? Sorry. No problem. I was just in the meeting waiting for you. I just got your email and just sent you over a quick email. I was in the Zoom meeting, so no problem at all. Okay. Here we are. How are you today? I'm well. I'm well. So I understand you wanted to look at the PCRM package, product, piece. Well, here's the thing. So we have a team that obviously works with PCR. and I guess we're kind of on this, we're trying to see what else PCR, if they have add-ons, what that would look like and see if there is an opportunity to potentially stay with PCR or if we're going to have to switch just due to it not being, have the capabilities of what we're looking for to add to an ATS system. Okay. Absolutely. Absolutely. What is, what is it not doing or what are you looking for that I can kind of address? See if it's something that we do. Well, yeah, I'm just so, you know, one thing we're looking for is, you know, a powerful sourcing AI system. I think that another one is, let's see here. I'm just comparing like, what do we have now? So right now it looks like PCR. I'm just going to compare to LOXO as an example, basic auto matching parsons. So like LOXO has a powerful sourcing AI automatic pipelines. Moderate Excel based experts where LOXO has built in analytics sourcing metrics. Let's see here. Outdated UI flexibility, but chunky, very easy to use in modern UI for LOXO. LOXO. I'm just, like I said, I'm comparing. It looks like you guys have a built-in basic CRM features where LOXO compared has one of the best recruiter CRMs. And this is just some research that we've done. So like LOXO in their package would be, it's a flat rate or per seat pricing, and then includes ATS CRM plus working tools, great fit for agencies. Now it does have some downfall as well. But, you know, I think the other thing is, you know, I think I really like the mobile app, you know, on PCR is a little hard to use versus some of the others. So I guess I'm just asking, like, you know, what, what, do you have add-ons that could make PCR more user-friendly to us, is there a way to make PCR maybe more streamlined instead of like when we're trying to do like roll-ups and things like that, where you got to always go in there and change, you know, all these things and it can be more streamlined or I guess, what are your thoughts? I didn't set up PCR, so I'm kind of new to like this whole kind of project moving forward. Sure, sure. Well, yeah. So with PC Recruiter, you actually right now have our recruiting piece, like our ATS, the premium package of it, actually with the AI. So you have the AI functionality that we have. You don't have our CRM piece. So that is kind of a whole different interface. It adds a sales funnel. It also supports the AI. And then we also have coming out an auto match AI piece, which will put a little button next to like any job you have in the system. You can click that button. It'll pull you the best 15 to 20 matches for that position in your database. Now, that being said, we don't look outside of the database. So PC Recruiter does not have any functionality to go outside of the PC Recruiter database. We don't like bring outside candidates in like I don't know if some of the others do. That's one thing we don't do. but yeah we do have kind of a different interface that I could kind of show you how it looks it essentially does everything your current interface does but lo...
