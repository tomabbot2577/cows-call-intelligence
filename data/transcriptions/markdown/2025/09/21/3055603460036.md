## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, this is Melissa with PRS. And I am calling because I have a user who's missing their portal. It just disappeared. Oh, okay. Are they still using the Outlook Classic application rather than the Outlook New? I do not know. Okay. I'm at their computer right now, if it's something I can check. Sure. So if you go to the bottom of the screen by, like, the Windows logo, there should be a search bar or a way to search. Just type in Outlook. And then we're looking for Outlook Classic as the application. Okay. I see that. Okay. Go ahead and open that up. Okay. And then do you see PCR listed in the main menu anywhere up there? No. Okay. So at least, yeah, at least you have Outlook Classics. You have the right version of Outlook. Next go to File up at the top left in Outlook. And there should be maybe something called slow and disabled com add-ins. It might be highlighted in yellow in that file menu. Oh, yeah, I see that. Okay, click on that and see if PCR underscore Outlook is listed there. It is. Oh, I see. Okay, so under that there should be like an options or a drop down so that you can enable that on the next restart of Outlook. Oh, okay. And then just apply? Apply, exactly. So it looks like it was slow to load on a recent time that they opened up Outlook. And so Outlook just turned it off and kind of disabled it. But this should get us back enabled again next time you open up Outlook. Okay, let me just try it while I have you on the phone. Perfect. Yep, it's back. Awesome. Cool. Anything else you've been having trouble with? No, that was an easy fix. Thank you. Happy to help. All right, reach out if you need anything else. Great. Have a good day. You too. Bye-bye....
