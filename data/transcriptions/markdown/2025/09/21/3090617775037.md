## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thanks for calling me. This is Robin. Hello, it's Ed Wallach with the Wallach Search Group. How are you doing? I'm good. How are you? I can't complain. Thanks. So I'm having an issue. Obviously, you know that we're integrated with Orwin for Marketplace, which connects to PCR. And I was having an issue yesterday where when I'd enter jobs in PCR, after 15 or 20 minutes they were not making it into the drafts in marketplace so i spoke with the folks at market at orwin and they said delete the user and create a fresh user and so now i'm at the screen where it says add user and i need the database name username password app id and the api key to get the integration back going so i can get my jobs from pcr back into marketplace let me see what could be going on here. So the app ID and API key, you no longer need that. You can literally just type in the words app ID, API key. We no longer require that. App ID and API key. Yeah, because through Rolf and Sys, I mean, back saying, I don't think you need them anymore, but then I wasn't getting anything to log in. So it's PC Recruiter in the top left. Database name, he said, is edwallachsearchgroup.edwallachsearchgroup, all one word. Is that accurate? Yeah, let me see. If you're in PC Recruiter right now, if you type, if you go to system, Yep. Hold on. Let me go to PCR. PCR login. Go to Go to system. Okay. Type the word API into the search box and then you'll see API settings. Third party API key. Okay, API settings. Yeah. Okay, great. It's edwallachsearchgroup.edwallachsearchgroup, all one word. Yeah, the first part is, like, some people have multiple databases. The first part is the database name you see, like, below your password field in the login screen. Yeah. And then the second part is what you see after ODBC. So, yeah, that's the only database. Okay. Then that's it. So I put the whole thing in there. Yeah, okay. Okay. So now back to there. Then the username and password is my actual PCR login? Yes. or whatever username you want to use to make those connections. So if you changed your PCR password, you would almost like want to immediately go change it there as well. Which I have not. So I'm using the same username and password as I do to log into PCR every day. Yeah. So are you using yours? Yeah, using mine. Do you use admin or? Oh, okay. Eduardo. Eduardo. So I just clicked it. Okay. Okay, so now it says ATS type. Let me edit it. Make sure it's active. Yep, that looks good. Okay, so now how do I – I'm actually also sharing screen with Anson Joel from Orwin right now. Hold on. What did you say, Joel? Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you. But the username is supposed to be app user or API user. And the password is supposed to be what was previously given to you. I am assuming that the app ID and the API key will be a combination of random letters and numbers. They're saying you don't need that anymore. You no longer need that. You no longer need the app ID and API key. PCR tech support says you no longer need the app ID or the API key, and you can just type in the word app ID and API key into those blanks. Okay, so I've added the user. So now how do we test and see if I'm connected? You'll just have to make a connection, unfortunately. Do you know? This all started by yesterday, putting jobs in, and then after the 15, 20 minutes, they weren't showing up in drafts. And that's when I reached out to Orwin. They go, yeah, just sometimes it gets gunked up. Delete that user. And I never copied it. I just deleted it. Do you know what IP address they're connecting from? who is it ending in 95 the company that you're my ip yeah do they know if it ends in 95 you mean my the ip address on my computer no that they're connecting as who would be marketplace people yeah ask me i have no idea and then 95 joel does your ip address end in 95 yeah I wouldn't have any idea about that he wouldn't have any idea on that okay I'm going to whitelist that anyway because I do see a lot of attempted connections from that IP address so maybe I just need to whitelist that the last connection 10-23 you didn't try just logging in as yourself right into what into PCR into Peace Recruiter I am logged in PC. I just did it a second ago to get that API database name. Do you want me to log out? Yeah, log out, log in, because I want to see which one's you. Okay. Log out of PC. Okay. Fine. I just logged out of PC. All right. I'm logging in again. There are two connections made about a minute apart from different IP addresses. I just want to see which one's you. Okay. I just logged in. I just logged back in as Eduardo. Okay. Yeah, you're the 154 number. Okay. Wait right now. So I think it is connecting. I'm going to go ahead and whitelist both IP addresses. But. where is my IP address no the IP address on this again this is the internal on my 192.168 my own system I don't know what the actual yeah I think it's 154 yeah just 154 so there's definitely something connected pretty frequently as 195 about every ...
