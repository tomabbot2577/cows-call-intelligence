You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Thank you. you you Hello, John, how are you? Hello. Good, how are you? I am well. You've got Jim here, and I think Jason just joined as well. Yep, I'm here. Excellent. Thank you, gentlemen. Excellent. Glad you could connect with us today and wanted just to kind of get you started here on your PC recruiter training journey. So what we're going to do today is there's a few questions that we've got to go through and figure out how you're going to utilize the system. Jason's got a kind of brief questionnaire to run through. We're going to take a look at that, go through some questions there. and we know kind of the basics of what you're looking for since your dimensional search. We know that you're going to need RingCentral and HireEasy, so we know some of the basics. There's just a few extras that we have to ask. And then at the conclusion of today's call, Jason's going to get a couple of sessions on the schedule for you before your training session, which I think is October 6th. Is that when that happens for you? For dimensional, yeah. That's when I start with dimensional training. Yeah, they were telling me at least get the first of this training under my belt before I get there, possibly two, but at least the first one. Yeah, I think they normally try to go for two usually. But, yeah, so I would be a point person. If you ever needed to add users to the system, pop me a quick email. I can help with that. Or if you don't know who to talk to, I can get you assistance from anyone here. And then Jason's going to be the primary person for training us and how-tos and everything like that. So he would be a point person to reach out to. Okay. So what I'll do, let me go ahead and turn everything over to Jason to go through the questions that he has and get those first couple of calls on the schedule. Sure. Perfect. Awesome. So, like, hi, John. I'm Jason. Like Jim said, I'm your PCR trainer. The questions I have are just going to kind of help guide me through our training process to make sure that I'm hitting all of the beats that you need. The first piece is going to be what type of recruiting are you anticipating doing? like contract placing, permanent placement, what in that area? Yeah, so obviously permanent placement. I also do want to do contract placement. I think I'm focusing on permanent initially just because it's easier to get in, right? But a big part of me joining Dimensional was the structure around contract placement. Okay. So I'm going to be doing both. Okay, okay, cool. Cool. And is there a particular industry or niche that you're going to be focusing in? Yeah, I'm going to focus in commercial construction. I'm going to start with an engineering consultant, consulting engineering, and then branching out among other commercial construction industries. Okay, cool. Have you worked as a recruiter before? 20 years. Okay. Yeah, I've got a lot of experience. Okay. Within the next 12 months, are you anticipating adding any additional users? No, I don't think so. Okay. Sorry if you have to answer myself. Have you worked with a CRM before? Oh, many, yeah. Okay, okay, cool. So it's a familiar idea. Yep. Okay. So the next one's going to be about training speed. We have three different levels. So we could go at slow, moderate, or fast. The training sessions are going to be an hour long each. Fast would be three a week. Moderate would be two and slow would be one. I know we want to hit those first two before the dimensional search training comes up. So we'll definitely schedule those two. But do you think you want to do them like one a week or two a week? Like what do you think is going to work with your schedule? Let's just do one a week for my schedule just because I'm a little crazy right now. And I should be able to pick up on a lot anyway, so I'm not terribly worried about it. But outside the first two, like you said, let's do one a week. I think that just makes more sense. Okay, perfect. And that's not set in stone. If we ever want to pick up the pace, we absolutely can. Okay. What operating system are you using, Windows, Mac? Windows. Windows. Okay. And what browser are you currently using? I use Chrome. Okay. And your email provider, Gmail, Microsoft? Like you use Outlook or Gmail? I use Outlook. It's Microsoft, yeah. Okay. I'm sorry, because my personal email is Gmail. I'm just confusing myself. I finally got everything converted to my work email and my business email. So now I'm trying to focus solely on that. Right. Okay. Let me just make sure I got everything. So your website, usually with people with dimensional search, where they are with their website, is they have the intention of having a website, but it's currently being built. Is that where you are? Yeah, we're in the ...
