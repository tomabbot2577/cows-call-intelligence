## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, I'm calling on behalf of one of my clients, the Seveson Group. They're getting the license expired and need to have it reset. Okay, sure. Let me reset that for you right now. All right, so I'm setting this to July 2026, and I could go a full year. So this is 7th, and that should be all set. And if they still have any issues or any warning signs or, I'm sorry, alerts like that, just let us know. All right. Thank you so much. Thanks. Have a good one. You too. Take care. Bye....
