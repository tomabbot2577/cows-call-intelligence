## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Robin, this is Rick Wolf. Hi. Hi, how are you? Oh, God, I just am pulling my hair out here. Just, I can't get this thing to work. I mean, I got a couple to work, and now I'm trying on another lawyer, and I can't seem to get it to connect in terms of making a record. So what are you trying to use to connect? I'm not clear on the issue. Okay, so I'm using the old Outlook as the PCR bridge to create a record. Okay. All right. So you're trying to like right-click on a resume, or what are you trying to do there? I am in a lawyer's record in their law firm. I tap on the V card, which is how I always do it. And then it has the progress bar in terms of making a record. I go to my PCR and it doesn't show up as a name that I've worked with. and I am in PCR within Outlook and I can't find the record, the new record. There's an old record for the guy, but not a new record. The old record was at a previous firm. Oh, let's see. I probably have to see it. I really don't do much with V cards, to be honest. Let me send you an invite for a meeting. Hold on one second. OK. Ignore whatever time it has. I just booked it for an hour, though. Got to change that. Can I do an hour? I might get two, but don't worry about it. I said don't send. Okay. Okay. Rick Wolf, troubleshoot, join Google Meet. Use microphone and camera now. Join now. I don't know. Open the people list. Hold on. Hold on one second. I didn't open it. Did I open this? No. Hold on one second. I don't need that. I don't need that. Okay. So if you can go over to your Outlook. Show me where you have the V-card stored. Where did I have the card stored? Well, why don't I just start from the beginning with this guy and do it that way. so there he is right here and what I did was I went up here to V and I pressed on V and I pressed on open file and since this is a new one I'll try open again and that takes me to Outlook PCR synchronized contact synchronizing contact so it should be synchronizing or synchronized now right I believe I honestly never really use it this way so I don't really get any V cards what was his last name Stamp Stemple. Stemple, okay. S-T-E-M-P-E-L. Or, excuse me, Stemp. Okay. That's my problem. Okay, so go to name. Yeah. Up at the top. Type Stemp for last name. Yeah. And then hit search. Okay, now he should show up at Kirkland. There he is. No, that's James Stemple. There's an Albert above. Yeah, and that's from years ago. Yeah, it may not move companies on you, because even when you have resumes, we don't move companies or anything like that. Let's click on that existing record, though, and let's go to activities. okay nothing for eight years okay let's see who's your outlook experts well I just I don't know about the v-card one let me just see do you normally just save it first? I just do that and then it saves it. If you go over to, because that goes over to your Outlook, right? Right. Let me see your Outlook down at the bottom. So was he in your contacts? Like if you go over at the left? Oh, with these guys here? Yeah. Let's see what's over there. Let's try this. Just do Albert and then do percent stem. It doesn't get made. I guess we could go to a different name at Kirkland and try making a contact with a different person and see if it's just that card I guess that's where it popped it up did you actually save it I wonder no you don't need to until it's there I mean I don't know let me see who names today Eric Hiber was brought in let's see activities Can you go to another person and try the process again? I just want to see it a little bit more. Yeah. Let's do that. Give me one minute. Let's just go to people. Let's try this guy here. I'll try this guy. Okay, that's the part I got to see a little bit slower. Okay, what do you want to do with the V card? Okay, so I guess we go open, right? Or do we just go save? Let's see what we have here. here. Open. Click on PC Recruiter and sync. And it does a synchronizing contact. So now if we looked up Kelly Buckley, we should find a Kelly Buckley. not in there okay no let's try something else then let's go let's just do a different firm see if uh maybe that'll work This guy, they don't have it. Okay, we'll try something else. Go ahead and try Arnold Porter. We can try Save As and Save As. We can try save as and see if that does it. Let's see what happens there. That's not going to do it. Okay. let's see what happens when you save nothing does save this try just open which is what I always do synchronizing contact you saw the progress bar okay now so Kelly Buckley Kelly Buckley was the previous one wasn't it Callahan you just did you went somewhere else after her yeah okay Okay. Oh, man. I'm not going to do that person. Nice, simple. How about James Clark? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, so now I should be able to track James Clark. No match. Now let's go down here to here.
