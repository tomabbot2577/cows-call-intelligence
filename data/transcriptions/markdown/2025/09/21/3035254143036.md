## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. It's Charlene Luria calling from Maxwell Management Group. I am just getting an error popping up when I'm trying to send an email saying that DC Recruiter could not connect to my outgoing email server. Okay. It says email set up, get email alias list. I know this has happened before, and I apologize. I can't remember how it was resolved. so um did you recently change any email securities or your password no okay was it working before and just suddenly now it's like it was just like yeah all day yes yeah all day yesterday it was fine just this morning when i was trying to reply to an email i this this uh error message popped up so sometime between last evening and this morning okay what is the email like are you emailing from the person's name record? I'm emailing from the email. I'm not emailing from the PCR portal. I'm doing it from the PCR email. Yeah. OK. I was just asking, sometimes people are emailing from the record and it'll be like, robin at main sequence com instead of dot com. And that'll throw that same kind of error. So I just want to rule that out first, because sometimes it's just missing the format, missing the at or the dot. I'm just replying. If you go to system and go to email setup. So, sorry, you said go to systems. Systems where? In PC Recruiter on the main toolbar. So go to system. Where do I find system? Sorry, I don't see that. On the main toolbar at the top of PC Recruiter. It says my PCR company name, position, schedule, and roll-ups. okay you just may not have the option pin do you see like a three-lined icon at the end of it okay click on that and then you should okay I do say how to click on it I do see systems now okay okay so then what you'll do is go down in the upper left section go to email setup mm-hmm and then I have the right you should see alias address list or email alias list. Yeah. Okay that's going to show a card at the bottom which should have your email settings if you click the pencil on it. Okay click the pencil. Mm-hmm. And what type of account is it? Gmail or Office 365? Who hosts your email? The IMAP server is Maxwell email it says. The server port is... Oh, you might have your own? Okay. Yeah, I guess so, yeah. So you might have your own mail server then. Okay. When you hit test connection, what kind of error does it give you? It says server mail.maxwellmanagementgroup.com, 250-mail. Yeah, there's a whole bunch of stuff here. Temporary server error. Oh, is it a server error then? Yeah, sounds like it. Basically what it means is it can't connect to your mail server. So that's why you're getting that message. Okay. So do I need to call our tech person then? Sounds like it. Yeah, you must be running. So majority of our clients are either Gmail or Office 365 as far as email. You must have your own host. and it looks like there's an issue there. Okay, so I do have our IT guys' information, and then I just, yeah, typically I go to PCR first because you guys are always so great, but I'll give him a reach out. Do you have another email app that you would typically use to send an email? Only my personal email. Okay. No. Yeah, with my work email, it's only this one. Okay, because it sounds like you'd probably have an issue. like let's say you had that in your outlook or something like that um you'd probably have an issue there too okay okay all right well i'll give i'll give our guy a call then and um and see if he might be able to support them see what's going on okay and bear with me one second because i have 50 million screens open i'm trying to find the right one no worries what was your first name again charlin c-h-a-r-l-i-n-e yeah okay just in case you're going to call in and we know where things are somebody else comes in i really need to close down some windows today open Sherlyn, Loria? Yes. Okay. All righty. Yeah, I would first check with your IT person and see if there's an issue on your mail server. That's what it sounds like. We just can't get it for some reason. So funny. I was going to say I'm just going to try to email him. But actually, I might be able to email him directly from PCR as opposed to my email. So I'll try that. And then I can always reply to my candidate through the portal as well. and then get in touch with Greg, is our IT guy. So I'll do that right now. Okay, sounds good. Thank you. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye....
