## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling MainSegments Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. This is Amanda calling from Ringside Town. How are you today? Good. How are you? Good, good. I was calling because we, one of our recruiters, for some reason it looks like their RingCentral activities aren't writing, and it looks like they're signed in and everything correctly within PCR. Okay, let me take a look at that. I'll just pull up your database here. So is it the database Ringside Search Partners, Ringside Technology? It's actually the ringside restore. So there it is restore okay and what is the actually let me login as the admin first and check the admin settings on that user yes and then which usernames have in the issue? It would be Q Crandall. Okay. Okay. Okay, it does look like it's set up correctly on the admin side under the user settings. So that's good. And then I'm going to log in as QCrandle. Okay. And the RingCentral status is connected. Okay. Is there a, let's see, Is there a name record that should have a activity written but did not get one that you know of? Let me see here. Well, it's recording zero for all of them. So let me see if I can. Oh, OK. Yeah, it looks like there's no calls, no text messages last week or before that. So I'm going to see if I can find a plan and see somebody that they would have connected with. Yeah, I guess the two things I would troubleshoot or check is I would have the user go to their, you know, myPCR in the main menu and click on that RingCentral status that's in green currently to disconnect and then click it again to reconnect. And that could maybe it just needed a reset. That would be the first thing I would try. And also I would check to make sure that they have the RingCentral app installed on their computer. We have seen some people using like a, like it's almost like a shortcut on their computer desktop that opens up RingCentral in the browser, but we would need the actual RingCentral like actual application installed for the activities to write. Yes, and she does. I just set up myself and I've done the sign out, sign back in as well. Okay. All right. Yeah, so those are the first troubleshooting steps. It looks like you've already done those. That's good. Let's see. That part is good as well. OK, here I'm going to do a test. Let me create a quick name record for myself. Oh, it's already in your database. OK. Resonance added to PCR. Got it. All right, and then let me just. You said the texting isn't working correctly either with the activities? Yes, so it's none of the activities are writing and I did find somebody who looks like she had a conversation with. Okay, yeah, what was that user, I mean name record? Yeah, it was Steven Wilson at Memorial Health. got it yeah okay yeah I just got a phone number. Okay, so I just sent myself a text to my own name and database from the... Am I at the right user? Yeah, signed in as QCrandall. And let's go to... Okay, so no activity is written yet. Sometimes it takes a few minutes for it to even connect to RingCentral to see that, but let me check to see if there's anything in the user settings again that I missed the first time around. on the project entity admin. Okay, yeah, nothing in the preferences that would jump out. Do you have his login information for RingCentral? If we were to just, while we're on the phone, do that disconnect from the MyPCR RingCentral status and reconnect again? Yes, I can get that. Okay, awesome. Yeah, I think just while we're on the phone, test doing that one more time where you go to MyPCR, logged in as the user, and disconnect the RingCentral status. Let me know whenever you're ready. Sure. Yeah. So, are you – so, you would log in as the QCrandall username on your end, and then – That's funny. Yeah, and then just go to MyPCR in the main menu. Okay, now I'm doing the sign out. Perfect, yep. Let's do that Ring Central status. Disconnect and reconnect. Thank you. Oops. Okay, that is done. Awesome. All right, so they're reconnected there. Let me just refresh the activities, although it does probably take five minutes or so for it to load. Yeah, so since we did try all this troubleshooting stuff, I'm going to open a separate ticket, but I'll monitor this for the next, you know, 10 minutes or so and see if that text that I sent to my own name record kind of fills in. If it doesn't, I'll probably have to have a tech team member schedule a time to take a look. Because you do have everything set up correctly on the admin side, and then on the user side, you are disconnected and reconnected, how we usually do there. So it looks like everything's set up right. So I'll just, yeah, I'll open up a ticket and get back to you if this doesn't write in the next 10 minutes or so to my name record. What's your best email address? It would be Amanda at ringsidetalent.com. Perfect. All right. I will get back to you soon. And yeah, we'll go from there. Hopefully, it just needed to reconnect one more ti...
