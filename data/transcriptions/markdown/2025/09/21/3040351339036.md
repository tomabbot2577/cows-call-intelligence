## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Jeanette. How are you? Good. How are you? Doing good. Hey, just have a quick question. We set up the contract staffing stuff that went out in the last week, so that's going great. And we tested the web portal, so thank you for all your help with that. That was tremendous. We tested the web portal, and I called in. Somebody help me. I can't remember their name on, say, if the person, when they download the app to their phone for the timesheets, if they can't do that, they click on the web portal and then click forgot password, right? So that's working. Oh, yeah, yeah. But the question is the subject line of that, when they get it, says password request from search opportunities and apply. Is there any way to change that? Because I think that might confuse them. Oh, okay. I don't even know if it's possible. Password. What was that? What did you say it was called, the subject line? Password request from search opportunities and apply. And it's the email they get if they go to the timesheet web portal and hit forgot password. Okay. Let me check to see if there's, it's like a form letter in the database? I don't know where it's coming from. There might not even be a way to change it, but I just thought I would check. Okay. Nothing in timesheet. Let me see a couple other places. I don't know if it's a default password reset for anything in the database. It could be, yeah, it might just be a kind of hard coded in there because there isn't any form letters I'm seeing that you could adjust for that password reset. But I'll check with the team and see if there's anything that they know of that would be able to change that. Because I see what you're saying. It doesn't really apply. You know, the subject line isn't exactly what somebody would be expecting. So, yeah, I'll make note of that and talk to the team and let you know if we can get that changed for you. Great, because ideally I just want to take off the end of it, you know, and do job.com, whatever, just so they know it's legit. So, okay. Well, thank you so much, Garrett. I hope you have a good day. You as well. Thanks so much. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye....
