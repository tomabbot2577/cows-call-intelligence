## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. How are you doing today, man? Doing good. How are you? Oh, hanging in there, hanging in there. Hey, your system seems like it's been running slow the last couple days. Is there something going on? No, we haven't had any reports or anything. Let me pop in on my end here. My internet speed's fine, so I don't... What the hell's going on? This PC's lagging, man. Let me pop in here and take a look. Everything's moving pretty quick on my end. Is there anything in particular that you're doing that it's running slow? Just anything. I click on a candidate, I click on their resume or different attachment or whatever, it just takes a few minutes to refresh the screen or repaint. It seems like it's taking forever. I check my internet speed, it's fine. I mean it's not running like it's supposed to be, but it downloads 533 mag 41 up, so it should be fine. Everything's loading right away for me. Have you tried clearing your browser cache? Sometimes that can slow things down a little bit. I did it before. I can try it again, I guess. That's the center delete browsing data. Where's the cache? Yep. Yep, and then you'll want it set to advanced, the time range all time, and then the only thing checked is that cached images and files. Yeah, that's why we got it checked, yeah, complete data, yeah. Should I need to open a new window when I do that or should it be all right? Normally you just want to log out and back in. Okay. I'll just open a damn new window here and see if that makes a difference. I'm using it in Chrome, too. That's what you guys suggest to use, too, right? Yep. It don't work very good in Firefox, does it? Why is that, man? You guys need to fix that. It's a completely different coding language. Let me see here. It's still pausing pretty good. Let me see another candidate here. I guess it helped a little bit. It did help some. Is there anything else I can do to... I would say maybe try hard resetting your router. Because even though the Internet's working on most pages, it's kind of like a highway system. Okay. Where... I'll do that in a day. I'll just do that later. I don't want to do it right now. Yeah. Well, I guess I could. I don't lose nothing. It just reconnects when I do it anyway, doesn't it? So I guess I could try that. Yeah. Like I said, it's like a freeway where one lane might be moving completely fine, or every other lane might be moving completely fine, and then there's an accident in one lane. It's causing a slowdown. Okay. So what you'll want to do is just unplug your router for like a minute, plug it back in and let it do its thing and come back up completely. Okay. Alright, I will do that, man. Appreciate it. Yep, not a problem. If you run into any issues, just let us know. Alright, thank you. Have a good one....
