## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning. This is Jim. Good morning, this is Alan. Good morning, Alan. How are you? Good, how are you? I don't know, not too bad. And is Sydney joining us today? There should be a couple other people joining. Okay. That was my next question. Is anybody else joining around as well? So we'll give everyone a minute to get locked in. Hello? Hello. Good morning. Hi, how are you? Very well. Is this Sydney? Yes, this is Sydney. And we have two others joining us too, but they should be here in just a minute. Okay, not a problem, not a problem. And are they dialing in or joining you? They'll be joining me. Okay, very well, very well. So give them a couple minutes to get here. Now, have you seen PC Recruiter before at all? No, just from researching online. Okay. I don't know about Alan, if you've had any experience with... So I just looked at the length and some of the product demos you have on the website is what I looked at. Okay. And as I recall from our conversation, you're looking for something premise-based, kind of self-hosted? Yes. Okay, and I don't know that anybody really has, we do have a version that does that. I don't know if anybody else really does much anymore because for a long time we were about the only one that still did that. Yeah, it's definitely hard to come by. Yeah, but a lot of times if you've got the server and you've got the team to do it, it's fine. You'd need to do updates, backups, and everything like that on your own, but it is available. Ours, most of the functionality is going to be available in the self-hosted version. So I'll kind of show you around that. And as everybody's joined, I just kind of wanted to open up the floor and kind of see what are the main things you're looking for in a software, be it ours or anyone's. What are your main requirements, features, functions that you need it to do, that you need to have, and what are you using now? So currently we use FileMaker, and what we're looking for is just basically – and Alan and Dana, please feel free to interrupt, but we're looking for basically like a resume system, resume database. And we also want to be able to... I don't know what the right term is. We want to be able... Or we're looking for products that will be able to kind of inject all of the resumes and job descriptions that we have and and see who matches with the job descriptions that we have. And the other part of it is the reporting capability and tracking candidates and kind of where they are in the process, kind of keeping in contact with them, just typical applicant tracking system type activities. Right now what we have, because I complain about it the most, So I'll give some of my gripes about it is that what we have is an action. So we have to, so if we write an email, we do it outside of the database, and then we go in and have to go into the database and say we sent an email. And then when they get an email back, if we ever wanted to have the history, and obviously, you know, for posterity, if anybody ever wanted to go back and look and see, we're going between multiple different, whether it's email and then the database. any sort of listings or postings or kind of what's going on, comments and thoughts like that. It's just it's doing the same thing in different areas. We do a lot of tracking via Excel because it's easier to see our current candidates that are in play because it's hard to go in and just grasp that and see where everything stands. Excellent, excellent. That gives me a good idea. So yeah, so with PC Recruiter, we are going to give you the ability to kind of have everything in one area. Within the system, you're going to be able to track your candidates, contacts, jobs, positions, interviews, pipelines, all of that is going to be in one database. You're also going to be able to track emails whenever you send an email. It's automatically recorded in the record of the person to whom you sent it or received it. So you can integrate your email into PC Recruiter as well. So essentially you're going to have a journal with each candidate showing everything that's going on with them. Interviews, emails, follow-up activities, anything like that. So that's going to be very very useful to you there. And if you don't mind I'm going to share my screen and kind of start to show you around. Jump in if you have questions, if that's alright. And this is the on-prem version, right? Yes. Do we want to know about both? Maybe, like we're thinking on-prem, but if you could just highlight where there might be additional if we go with the cloud version, is that what you would say? Sure, sure, sure. And I'm wondering, why are you looking to go on-prem? Why is that of great importance to you? It's sort of what we've done, and most of what we do is sort of internal. Yeah, it's just where we've been at this point. Okay, okay. Y...
