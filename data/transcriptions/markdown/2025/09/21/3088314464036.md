If you go to the top right where the capture tool icon is, top right of your screen, double check that the basic mode is turned off and to the left. Okay, hold on. Then it's turned on. Basic, all of them are turned to the left. Okay, that's good. So it's not the basic mode. Let's see. Let's see. Let's actually get a screen share. I could probably come up with that way. Is it RingCentral or FastSupport? Yeah, RingCentral. OK, hold on one second. Whenever you're ready. All right. One second. Just firing up. Okay, so the meeting ID is 547-827-585.
