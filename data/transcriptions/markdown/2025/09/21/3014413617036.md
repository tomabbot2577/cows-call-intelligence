## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, how's it going? Hey, quick question for you. Here. You're working with Esner Advisory Group, right? Eisner Advisory Group? I think so. Sounds familiar. They just had one of their people ask for their portal serial number, but it's not the contract signer. Oh, he CC'd on it, though. Okay, that's all right. That's all right. Yeah, let me find that. Advisor group, okay. Do you think I'm going to find that serial number? Yeah, you can set it. Do you need me to make sure it's updated to the latest? Let me make sure it's not expired or close to expiring real quick. Okay, that expires in June 2026. I must have just done that. Yeah, you're good to send that over then. I was just concerned because this person's not in Mike's sequel yet. Okay. But Brian Lucas is CC'd on the email. Okay. Yeah, it's all good. And yeah, if I'm training other people who aren't the contract signer, I usually do just give them that portal code or serial number. So maybe I've been doing it a little too willy nilly, but... Well, it's different in a training. I guess you're right. Yeah, that's true. But was there an Ashley in those trainings? Yes She's one of the main people from there That sounds familiar Exactly Perfect Perfect Cool That's all I needed Thanks for taking care of that I'll talk to you later No problem...
