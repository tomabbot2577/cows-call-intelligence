## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi. So I keep running into this same issue, and I don't know how to fix it. We used to have someone that would just be in charge of PCR, but she quit. So I don't know how to fix this, where it says invalid email credentials. Oh, okay. That probably just means maybe you changed your email password and can't connect to your server. What is your name? Oh, okay. Francisco Michel. Can you spell that name? M-I-C-H-E-L. Okay. With Lithco. Okay. Yeah. Let me just check a couple things. Okay. So there's two spots that we might need to have you change. Let's see. Do you know if you changed your email password or anything like that? I don't think I have, but I just use a single sign-on. Okay. Do you log into the database named LISCO Contracting LLC or LISCO Conversion Data? I'm going to guess. No, LLC. The other one is just old data. Gotcha. That's what it sounded like. Okay. What is your username for Peace Recruiter? I don't need a password, just a username. Yes. I'm just using Michelle F. Okay. I think that's what it is. Yeah. It looks like it got in. Okay. I'm just going to check if you're set up not only for sending but for incoming, too, because then that means we have two places. Yeah. Let's see. That does not need to be the word yes. Yeah. Okay. Do you know how to get into PCR mail? Yes. I'm in there right now, actually. It's very top right. Okay. Yeah. It looks like it stopped pulling on August 4th in the morning. So sometime probably August 4th. That's the last thing that's in your inbox, at least. Okay. So if you're in PCR mail, what you're going to do is you're going to click configure at the top. Yeah. And we're going to have to go to two places and have you re-authenticate. And the reason is mail servers is for the incoming and keeping everything in sync. And alias address list is just for sending. So under configure, let's have you first click mail servers. And then go to action on that row that you'll see at the bottom and select edit. Now, two things I'm going to have you do here. One of them is see where it says save sent email to sent item folder. Yep. Flip that to no. So if you've ever noticed, sometimes if you're sending an email, you see two copies in your sent folder. That's why. They do it automatically. You don't need us duplicating that. Yep. So I'm going to have you flip that to no. And then the other thing is you're going to click the black sign in with Microsoft option. and you'll either be prompted to put in your Office 365 username and password, or if you're already signed into Office 365, it might go really quick and return you right back to the mail server screen. Yep, done. Okay, hit test connection. And then if you no longer get the error, Yay, this is okay. Click save. Okay, so you're going to exit the test screen and then save the mail server area. Cool. Okay. So that should fix incoming. It might take a little bit to catch up. It didn't take too long, but it was disconnected for, you know, 11 days. No, 10 days. My math is pretty bad today apparently. Okay. Next thing that we're going to change is up at the top if you see alias address list. Mm-hmm. Let me check this one first. Test. Oh, that one actually says it's successful now. Okay. Did you do the same thing up there already? Yeah, I did the same thing already. Okay. All right. So, yeah, that one's good. And then the emails are starting to catch up. They are starting to download. So you should be able to send but also get your incoming. Yay. Thank you. And you should be all set. Anything else? Nope, that's it. All right. Well, have a great week. Thanks, you too. Bye-bye. Bye-bye....
