## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Brian. Hi, Brian. Is this PC Recruiter? Yes, yes. This is Brian with PC Recruiter. Who am I speaking with? This is Daniel Jimenez. I am – Hey, Daniel. Nice to meet you. You too. I'm having a bit of an issue here. I'm not sure if I reached the right number. This is just a technical support issue. Okay. Were you trying for technical support? All right. So when you dial that main number, you must have hit one because you got sales and you got forwarded out to my cell phone. If I could catch you back, I would. But when you redial the number, you simply want to – when the recording starts, you want to hit option two instead of option one. And that will take you right to tech support. Yep. Gotcha. Appreciate the help. Absolutely. Talk to you soon. Take care. Bye. Bye....
