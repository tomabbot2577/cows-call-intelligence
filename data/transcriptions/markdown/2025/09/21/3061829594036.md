## 💬 Full Transcript

 Good morning, the Everest. Good morning. Is Haley available? Yeah, one second. Let me transfer you over. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Hi there, this is Haley Kremit with the Everest Group. I'm unable to get to the phone right now. Leave me a voicemail and I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Leave your message at the cone. Press pound when finished. Good afternoon, Haley. It's Jim Lombardo with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. We spoke yesterday and we had a demonstration. Scheduled a PC Recruiter today at noon. I wanted to give you a call. I dialed in and I didn't see you there. So I wanted to give you a call, see if you still had some time. It appears you've been otherwise detained, so I thought I'd see if you wanted to reschedule or what. Maybe we could set something up for maybe Monday, Tuesday. I'm pretty open both days. Give me a quick call when you get a moment or drop me an email. Well, you know what, Mark's 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks. We'll talk to you soon. Bye-bye....
