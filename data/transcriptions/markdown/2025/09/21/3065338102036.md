## 💬 Full Transcript

 My main sequence technology, this is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler Scott Shapiro. Hey, how's it going, Scott? Does anyone else work here besides you? There's a few of us. That's like every time I call you, the only one who answers the phone. It kind of goes around, Robin. You're just calling at the right time. Yeah, it's all good. So this is probably an easy fix. So one of my employees was going through a training, and the person that they were talking to mentioned that we have like 90 companies that – Katie, what did he say they were? Yeah, we have like 90 default companies in PCR that we add people into PCR from LinkedIn. So how do we go about fixing that? We can do that with a global change. So let me pop into the database. You're in the MR Charlotte database, right? Yeah. Okay, so yeah, it looks like you have – it's one company that you have set as your default company. It looks like the name might have just been changed, though. Let me – or that was somehow set as default. Now, does there have to be a default company? Yes. Okay. So what we can do is the default company in your database right now is a company called Axonius. Axonius, yeah, uh-huh, right. Let me see if you – because I'm not seeing one. Yeah, it looks like maybe somehow you might have accidentally deleted your regular default company. A lot of times it's called default for candidates or candidates. Yeah. So what we can do is we can recreate that company and set that database as default company. Okay. And then under the names tab of that accident company, you can select the results and move them, do the change company option. Right. Like add them to a roll-up and then do the change company in bulk into that candidates. candidates? Well, I mean, typically what we do is we'll capture a candidate from LinkedIn into PCR. And if the company's already in PCR, which a lot of times it is, you know, it matches, I guess if the company's not in PCR, it has to put it in as a default company. so you can have it either way where if you like let's say you just use the ad wizard and add somebody into the yeah which is we typically don't so typically only we had people into PCR through PCR capture LinkedIn okay I'm just looking at some of the people that are in this company right now. It looks like it might have been this way for a while. Yeah. I'm just looking at their date entered. Yeah, I'm guessing it was probably a while ago. Yeah, everybody in this company is from like... Let me take a look here. Oh, no, there's some recent ones. But yeah, so what we can do, let me go ahead, I'll create that. Do you want to just be called like candidates? Yeah. Yeah, that way we know that we have to change it. Because with that... And then I guess what I can... You can bring people with them. I'm sorry, go ahead. You can bring – like when you capture someone from LinkedIn, if they're – if you turn off that capture to default company toggle, if their company is not in the database already, it will create a company record for them. Right. But will it create a company record of the company that matches on LinkedIn, or it's going to be the default company? it'll be the it'll create one that matches linkedin the only time we want yeah the only time people will go into candidates is if you don't have their company information or if you parse them in from a resume things like that it's kind of just like a catch-all right which we don't like i said we we put people into pcr through pcr capture linkedin hundred percent of the time yeah so but the database does need a default company because it does control a few other things like on the back end right I understand that which again is great we just won't be using it anyway but I understand you have to have that yep so let's see so I just fixed and then I guess candidates is your default company I'm gonna add all these names to a roll up list for you under that other yeah exonius because some of the exonius ones are probably correct. Yeah, so that way you can go through the roll-up list and kind of check which ones, but there's 2,166 name records attached to Exonius. That's crazy. But like I said, this is going all the way back to like 2022 that these names were being used. Yeah. So what's the best way to fix that? Just go to click on the name, click on LinkedIn, do PCR capture, and it will update that way? Yeah, you could do it that way. So let me add all these to a roll-up list for you. Right. So, because then what we could do is if we, so for instance, let's say, for instance, someone is listed as a default company exonius, and I go into LinkedIn, and they're working at Stay Gold Solutions, and I do a PCR capture and update into PCR, it will update to Stay Gold Solutions. Yep. It will match what's on their LinkedIn. Yep. Okay. All right. So you have a roll-up list now called – it's just called Names Exonius. So that's all the names that were listed under – And that's a roll-up list that's under – I put it under your...
