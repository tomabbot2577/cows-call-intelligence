## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Robin. It's Sean Reeves calling from Corrigo. How are you? Good. How have you been? Pretty good. I have a question. When I am exporting either a company record or a name record in either Excel or as a CSB, and it asks me if I want default fields and there's only one option. If I check it, it gives me default fields. If I don't check it, it just runs it. How do I control what fields I want to export? Because where do I go and adjust that? So when you don't check that default field, that's how it's labeled, that just gives you like all of the predefined fields. It doesn't give you like any custom things. I'm sorry, scratch what I just said. The opposite. When you just export and you don't check that box, it does what's in your layout. Okay, just layout. That's based on your layout of the roll-up. Now, if you check that box, it's just all of the predefined fields. So opposite of what I meant to say. Okay, so if you check it, it's just predefined. Right. So if you have, like, custom fields or things like that, like, if you check that box, It's kind of like a set list. Okay. So you have two options, really. You could either further customize your roll-up layout with what you do want, or you could – is it a list of names? Well, I'm working in companies right now. Just to bring you up to speed, I have taught myself to code in Python over the last two weeks, and I have been scraping database stuff, and I have been leveraging all of the AI tools. Like, I think I finally have a piece of cord with ChatGPT. Like, I know how it needs to. Chat sucks at going out and scraping. Basically, I think it's not allowed to, but I went and taught myself how to do Python, so I have scraped up all sorts of goodness. And what I'm doing is rather than going through a thousand of my companies in my database and adding addresses and adding this and adding that, I've scraped it off the websites and I'm just loading it into a CSV and re-uploading it. So I just want to make sure that I have all the right fields, like all of my custom fields and predefined fields so that it's ready to receive that information. So what you may want to do, if you don't want to change your roll-up layout, there is a like an option for names like a name report where you could specify the field that you need oh is that under report yeah but you'd want to first create the report like if you let me go around one of my databases hold on one second I'm in a customer database oops don't want to be there hold on one second no problem so if I want to do it in the in the actual export function if if I have done an advanced search and pulled up companies and I want to throw those on a roll-up and print that roll-up out or export that roll-up, I need to do it by adding to the layout and then not checking that box. Because if I check the box, it's just going to be the predefined fields. Correct. Okay. Now, you could do a name, I mean, a company report if it's based on companies, but I believe that one's more limiting. Let me just make sure. I think you can only get... So company reports, name reports. Okay, so there's just a summary report and a detail report. Yeah, that's not what you're going to want, though. Let me see something here real quick. Here, manage custom reports, company reports. And you get one, two, three times how many rows? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. What is that? Eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Would 24 fields be enough? Oh, God, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure it would be. Okay. So here's what you could do. And I'm going to send you to the Learning Center on this, too. Okay. Okay. analytics and reporting custom reports okay that way you have the instructions as well but i'll tell i'll tell you about i'll tell you about it too though yeah tell me about it address? My email address? I've got a new one. I actually had to restart, and I've got to talk to you at some point in time about switching over everything from being named Corrigo. Everything's fine. Zach and I are still friends. It's send it to Sean, S-E-A-N at Reeves, R-E-E-V-E-S and Victor, E-S, recruiting all one string of characters. Hold on one second. I lost my string again. I have way too many windows open right now. Nope, I do too. My God, it's like a hot mess. Sean, wait. ReevesRecruiting.com Okay. I'll send you this link. Okay. If you go to reports on the main toolbar. Yep. yep yep and then what you're going to do there's a gear icon at the top right which is where you go in to create a brand new report okay custom company reports and then yes you click on the custom company reports tab okay and then first thing that you're going to want to do hold on one second i'm so sorry about this it's all right not that one not that one not that one my gosh waiting for Robin waiting for Robin so it's reports gear icon alright so I'm just going to open up another window because I have no idea gear icon and then I do So the first thing is you're going to want to expand lik...
