## 💬 Full Transcript

 Okay. View. Get out of there. Hold on one second. Okay. Why is this? Okay. All right. I'm so stumped because I can't, like, I saw from your notes where you can, like, go ahead and save it and it would still work. but okay so let's see this I'm going to pull up so we only got through the admin portion can you see my screen yeah yeah okay Teresa let's just go ahead and try this logged in as him now logged in as him okay yeah let me just see if it really recognized anything that we did even though it doesn't look like we did it This is so confusing. Sorry. Okay. So here are the user steps here. So make sure he's logged into his Zoom app and then log into his Peace Recruiter account. Did I forget to do something for you guys? Do I need to share my screen? Okay. Okay, I am looking at World Bridge Overview Team Dashboard. Was that on your other computer? Yes. Okay. That's the other computer. All right. See if it will let you overwrite it. I'm Chris's computer. Go ahead and try to present. Let's see if it will override it. Okay. There we go. Can you do a new share, though? Make sure you go over to entire screen so that we can see everything. Otherwise, we're just going to see that one PCR window only. Hang on. Where is – where was that at? I don't remember. In the meeting screen. Hit stop presenting, I believe is how it's going to be labeled. Does your presenting... Oh. Should be the same icon that you click to present. Oh, stop presenting. Yes. And then do share. Okay, and click it again. Look over to the entire screen. That's what I did wrong. Yep. That's what I did wrong. There we go. Okay. All right. So he's got, is he in his Zoom app? Okay. I see the icon. Can you go ahead and open that up? Let's just make sure he's logged into it. So he's logged in here and then here's the Zoom app. He's logged in here. Sure, okay, pop-up notes are going to appear at the lower right. Can you try the, see the very top right where it's got the gold number one? Yep. Click directly on that gold number one. I wonder if that's our notification we're looking for. Okay, click there. Click sign in. So I think the stuff for the activity writing is why we're having an issue in the other area. Does that sound right, Garrett, from what you've seen before? Yeah. So the setup process, it'll show something like application not found, which is kind of alarming, but it's actually supposed to show that until we get the activity writer. Okay, so allow this app to use my shared access. Yes, right? Yeah, towards the bottom is a little checkbox there that you want to turn on. Then hit allow. Okay. I kept trying to do save, but then it would still say that you're, like, not authenticated. So kind of we're going to, like, half do that, but then really just have the person do this, it sounds like. So technically. Yeah, it seems like there's some false setup. It's like false negatives throughout the setup. But yeah, we should. So do I need to do this lock soft one? No, that is old, old, old phone stuff. I don't even know if we even need that anymore. That was like. So basically, we just need to test. Yeah. Now, the problem is because we still have to get approved by their marketplace, from what it sounds like, they won't write the activities. That's what the application is that's missing. And that's fine. We've got our guys are writing activities themselves and stuff, so that's not a big deal. Okay. And I can explain that to him. I just want to make sure that it's working. Do you happen to have meat in there? like I'm in a lot of databases because I've been around forever try Robin Montoni M-O-N yeah and then hit search let's just see if I'm in here you know I'm not okay uh do you have the company main sequence in there by any chance or any just any name that you feel comfortable trying to call let's see if it works main sequence. Okay. Go to any one of those with a phone number. Oops. Okay. And go to the right of the phone field and click the phone icon. Oh, there it is. Hit the always allow open Zoom. Yeah. and it should be passing it over yep it's calling it looks like it's calling yay excellent thank you Gary I got really hung up on what you're supposed to do in the user area yeah it gives you a lot of messages that seem like you're not doing it right but for now it just is I was thinking like you release portion and hit save but okay alright well Perfect. We got it somewhat working. It's working. That's all that matters. Yeah. Okay. I'm so sorry about this, Teresa, but thank you for your patience with me. No problem. I appreciate your help. Thank you so much. You are welcome. And thanks, Garrett, for jumping in. Yeah, no problem. Have a great rest of your day. All right. Thanks. Bye. You too. Bye. Bye....
