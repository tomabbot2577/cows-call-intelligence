## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. My PCR capture is not working great. What do you mean by not working great? Like, is it not popping up, or is it running slow? Yeah. No, it's not popping up. All right. Can you do me a favor? And up in the top right of your browser, you'll see a little puzzle piece. yep click on that and then go to manage extensions oh shit hang on a second I think I pressed the wrong one puzzle piece upper right corner oh there we go yeah manage extensions go ahead and then you'll see the one that says PCR capture I do and you'll see a little blue toggle in that same box yep go ahead and turn it off and then back on okay And then go back to your LinkedIn page and just refresh the page. That'd be sick if it worked. It did. Look at you. Awesome stuff. Do you leave your computer on overnight sometimes? I do. Yeah, most times. So what can happen is your browser sessions can time out. that capture tool to freeze up but by turning it off and back on it just restarts a new session for it that's awesome that's a quick easy fix i'll remember it yep so you should be good to go awesome thanks tyler i appreciate it yep not a problem have a good one all right you too...
