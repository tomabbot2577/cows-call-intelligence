## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Thank you for calling Main Sequence. Hello. This is Robin. Hi, I need to make a payment. Okay. What is your company name? It is Genesis Search Consulting. Okay, let's see. Is this for John Lipman's office? Yes. Okay. Are you going to be doing it by card? Yes. Okay, because you can pay from within the invoice, and then that would set you up with auto pay as well. Do you have the invoice? I can send it to you. Let me see. Yeah, can you send it to me? Yeah, hold on. Let's see. Genesis Consulting, if I have it. Let me pull that up. come on Robin oops hold on one second okay yeah they go to did he forward it over to you because they do go to John right now no so I have that last email and I know we were on auto pay before. Yeah, so you don't need to redo the auto pay. Okay. So I'm going to send you, okay, the August one. Okay. And what is your email that I should send this to? It's accounting. Same as John's. Okay. Now, should we be using your email address primarily then, the accounting yet? And then maybe just copy John? Okay, let me change this first before I do it then. Okay. So let me go back there with me one second. Okay. And then this way, like you could set up with the accounting portal and all that other stuff that we now have. Okay. So the primary email is accounting at genesissearchgroup.com, right? Yes. And then we'll cc jlitman at genesissearchgroup.com. Okay. Let me update that. Okay. Now if I go to end places. Okay. So I just sent him. Can you let me know if you received him? Let's see here. Yes. So I got 2202-449-4313746. Yes. That should be first. Yes. If you go into one of them, you'll click view and pay. You want to go ahead and start that? and I'll just stay on and then I don't know if it's going to be a three or if not what I can do is just once you set it up with auto pay then I could process whatever Okay, so there's still two left. So I can go ahead and process them because you did turn the auto pay on when you paid one of them. Do you want me to go ahead and use that click here option on the other two? Okay. There were three, so let's see. So the other thing that's going to meet with this billing portal, there's a one of those invoices, there's like a link to sign up and you can use your accounting at Genesis to make the account and then what you can do in there you could always go in there to view your invoices let's say you need to like print an invoice that you paid you can do that but if you ever need to change your card once you create that account you can go into that billing portal and then the vault area is where you can change what card you want to use so it's like something like of expires like you can manage that on your own or if you just want a different one see if these process then okay we'll be pending here because it takes a moment I'm going to try to open this. I'm going to try to open this. I'm I'm Okay. Yep, they're not paid. And I think, did it just send you a receipt as well? Uh-huh. Okay, perfect. Yeah. Yeah, so you should just read the one that you did plus the two that I just processed. Okay, perfect. It is now current. Awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Have a great week. You too. Bye. All right, thanks. Bye. Thank you....
