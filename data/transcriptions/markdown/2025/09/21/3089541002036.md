 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim. Good afternoon. How are you? I'm well, Brian. How are you? I'm good. I didn't mean to get all choked up. I apologize. No worries. No worries. Yeah, thanks for joining me today. I wanted to show you on PC Recruiter a little bit. Just kind of wanted to initially see kind of what you're using now. What are you really looking for in a software package, be it ours or anyone's, so I can know kind of what your main criteria and requirements are. Yeah, great question. So, Jim, I think the best way to get started is to say, hey, I'm a little bit of a blank slate. The last time I was in agency recruiting was about eight years ago. Or no, I'm sorry, rather nine years ago, nine years ago. And I've been a corporate recruiter. I exited the organization I was at and decided rather than get into the rat race of trying to find a new recruiting role, that I would make one for myself. And so I have been actively building, and I have about seven clients right now and 10 roles amongst them. I've got I'm using pin.com for my sourcing solution and sourcing engine in conjunction with LinkedIn LinkedIn premium not LinkedIn recruiter I want to draw that distinction and Google custom search engines that's my sourcing engine and then I'm using the G suite Google and Google sheets to keep track of candidates and that is my ATS and that's my story and I'm sticking to it all right all right so kind of looking for the basics tracking names companies interviews jobs kind of the full gamut you've got it okay excellent actually yes I want to show you on PC recruiter a little bit and and I'm going to show you I think you were referred to us from somebody as I recall yeah so uh Bryant who who's another recruiter in the Atlanta area and he focuses on on sales talent I focus on technical talent and yeah, I just thought that it made sense if something was working for somebody that I admire, you know, don't reinvent the wheel. Just do the thing that they're doing and try to keep up. Awesome. Awesome. That's good. Yeah. So yeah, he's been with us quite a while, quite a long time. So yeah. So let me share my screen and kind of show you around here. If you have any questions as we go through, just jump right in. And I'll warn you, I have another call at two. So I'm going to try and get this done in a half hour, which shouldn't be a problem, but if we need to reach out to another time follow-up we certainly can Jim no worries alrighty so so get logged in I'm going to share my screen you should be looking at my sign in screen for PC recruiter and once you see it let me know you see that screen okay yep we're good let's go awesome awesome so so this is all cloud-based it could be something that's going to run on a PC or a Mac there's a mobile app so you can really access it from from any type of machine anywhere you need to. I'm going to get logged in with my password here and get logged into the system. And once I am, this is going to be more or less how it's going to look. Now, it's very configurable. So you could actually, if you wanted to not use the sequencing piece, you could hide that in the main menu bar. You could rearrange the buttons and where they are. And then you have full control over if you were looking at, for example, a company record, what fields show down there. We have a standard company record that comes with the system, but you can add your own fields, move ours around, make a combination of the two. So a lot of flexibility in how that's going to look and what fields are going to be where. Same going to hold true with the name record, position record. So it's going to be very, very configurable. So you can really make it look how you think it should look and what's most interest, what's of most use to you. Basically three primary areas in the system. You're going to have a primary menu bar at the top. That's going to really be your main navigation. That's going to control this middle area, which for searching search results and lists and the bottom area for the records themselves so if I look at my main menu are this is where I get to my my primary record types like names companies positions so I'm going to have names are going to be the contacts my candidates pretty much any person that I need to track in the system so those are all my people or my names I'm going to have companies are going to be the companies that I'm working with client companies or potential client companies so this is also going to give you a some CRM functionality so you can track other companies you're talking to and your efforts to sign on more clients and then positions obviously the jobs you're looking to fill so those can be entered into here as well cool thing about a PC recruiter is when you enter a job into the system you can utilize our job board tool and...
