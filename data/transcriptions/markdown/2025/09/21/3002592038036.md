## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. It's Ben Williams. Did I call tech support? This is the same number. It'll get you to customers. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I have two questions. Bill Kubicek, is that correct? Am I saying it correctly? Yeah, Bill. I think he's the principal. He called me on the 23rd. I was out of town. I'm trying to return his call. It's about a billing issue. I don't know if you have a way. I tried to call a number back, and it goes to a voiceover that I set up. I didn't know if there's a way to get to him first. And then the other thing is that we still have training hours to be done, and we want to make some changes and some other stuff. So who do I talk to about that? It was Robin, but I don't know if she moved to a different role or not. Let's see here. Let me ask you a question because I know you're a technical support guy. So we moved all of our staffing operations to another company's name. The company's name is Moja. What do we have to do to change the database? Is that a big ordeal or is that just something that can be done on the fly, just change naming and all that kind of stuff? Oh, so you want to rename, like, the dropdown when you sign in to PCR, what database is listed there? Yeah, I can put in a ticket and have our tech team do that. Oh, perfect. So we need to change that. Do you need the address or anything? The URL, I think that you can't really change that part of it, but just the database name when you first log in can be changed. The URL is kind of stuck that way, unfortunately. Oh, okay. So does it, I guess the question is, does it even, because we're going to start, you know, like, like text messaging people and stuff like that. And we want it to come from our Mojo.net domain. Oh, yes. If you're texting, it would be, yeah, the URL to log into PCR won't have any bearing on that. If you're texting, it'll just come from whatever phone number you're texting from. And if you're emailing, you would just set up your, your new emails inside of PCR. so yeah you could you would just be setting up your emails with your new email addresses for each username so when you say setting up emails um can you explain to me what you mean by that like like our users have probitis tech names right now they'll have emails they'll have to have like um different email addresses i'm not sure because right so right now right now i go to URL it's some ww2 PC recruiter and it looks like the points to our database ODBC database for the attack bubble glass that won't change correct right so that's staying the same once you get to the login screen you'll have a different name once I put in this ticket with our tech team when you choose your database and then put in your name oh sure let's say Mojo Incorporated there. Okay. So I just logged in. So where do I get, where do I get the web, the web address? For like, for like, so like when it, let's go to post to our website and stuff like that. So you think inside of PCR, we have a connection to your website called the job board where you can post positions. I would just create a ticket with our web developer to give you whatever you need to get the job board on your new website. So do you already have a new website created? It's in the process of being created, but I want to give it to them now so they can embed the code in, right? Right, the code, exactly. Okay, so I'll talk to Drew. We're going to have a new job board. What's your new website? How do you spell that? M-O-J-A dot net. A dot net. Okay. And so two tickets. So I'm going to have one with the tech team to change the name of your database and then with our web developer to get your job board ready to go for Moja.net. Okay. And then your emails, for each username, you have an email set up where you connect PCR to an email address so you can send and receive email out of PCR you'll have to redo those connections to your new email addresses if you do have new email address so I'm in I'm in the database right now okay okay I'm seeing stationary set up email alias email signature campaign job default all that stuff where do I go and do that is it on the user settings? So there's two things you'll change. The mail server is monitoring all the incoming mail and then the alias will be your outgoing mail. So to adjust both of those, go to the gear icon at the top right of PCR next to the circle that has your profile picture. It's a little gear icon that has a drop-down menu. Then select email in that drop-down menu, the top option. and then that'll open up pcr mail in a new tab at the top left go to configure another gear icon see it and then uh go to mail servers first you'll have in the bottom frame uh the mail servers you already have connected to add a new one we don't go to the oh you don't have any we It certainly don't happen. No. Okay. So, yeah, for your username, you aren't really monitoring the incoming email. It doesn't sound...
