Thank you. you you you you you you you you you you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Brian. Hey, sorry. I forgot all about this meeting, so I apologize for being late. No problem. No problem. I just was waiting a few more minutes to see if you couldn't join us or join me. Is Jonathan on? No. No, he is not. I don't know that I ever got an accepted invite, so I don't know if I was expecting him fully. Let me just quickly text him a second, Jim. Hang on a second. Sure. Because it would be more important for him to be on this call than me. It's better if we both are. All right. I sent him a text, Jim, but we'll see you. We have to give him a call. We'll see if he can join. He's the only one free to call. Are we going to be sharing a screen at all? I may, because I can show you some of the new stuff you don't have with PC Recruiter, if you're interested. So I might share it. Okay. Are you going to – can I – I'm calling you from a cell phone. Can I pull up my laptop and get in that way? That way I can see better. Absolutely. Okay. So I'll be back in just a few minutes, okay? Sounds good. All righty. Thank you. Okay, bye-bye. Talk to you soon. Thank you. you you you Thank you. Hello. Hello, Jonathan. How are you? Hey, good, good. Sorry about that. I completely lost track of time. No problem. No problem, man. Brian was in. He's dialing back in. So he was in on his cell phone. Okay, good. He's dialing back in. Perfect, perfect. Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. How are you? Where are you about at, Jim? Ohio. Cleveland, Ohio. Ohio. Okay. Okay. Okay. How are things out in Cleveland this time of year? sunny and warm. So that's just, it's all right here this time of year. Really the only bad thing we have is snow, and it's not even that much snow anymore. Yeah, well, we're both down in North Carolina, and it hasn't been too bad the past couple weeks in terms of the heat. We've actually had a lot of rain and stuff, which has been good because I've been dealing with a lot of AC issues the past several weeks. That's no good. Luckily for Jonathan, it's only been like 115 degrees here. I'm back on my cell phone. I'm just waiting for my laptop to boot up and all that stuff. When I get out of the laptop, I'll get off the cell phone. For sure, for sure. All right, yes. I wanted to talk a little bit about your PC Recruiter account and talk about some of the new stuff we have. I wanted to see, kind of, did you have any questions initially that led to you originally reaching out, or any thoughts or things you've heard about that you want to see, or anything like that? No, I talked to, we read some past two invoices that were going to an old email account that we weren't using anymore. So as soon as I found out, I go, oh, my God. And then, I don't know, Jonathan, did we have anything in mind? Did we say we had something better? I think it was just the way the invoice was laid out, it was, you know, we have an a la carte service, I guess. Right. And we didn't really know what each of the things we were being billed for were. And we just wanted to make sure, whatever they were, they were things we were using. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Sure, yeah. So let me look. Let's see if I have that. I had the invoice open for a little while here. Yeah. So, Jim, it's just Jonathan and me now in our company. And the more I can avoid PCR, the less it screws up Jonathan. So, you know, he uses it all the time. I use it when I have to kind of thing. but I just want to make sure that we're paying for stuff that we're using. Sure. Sure. Let me see. I don't even have the invoice at hand. Let's see if I can find it here. Yeah, if not, I can probably forward an email we got from your billing person. Yeah, if you can forward that along, that's easier to find because, like I said, I don't have – I had it open and I closed it and I don't even know – I think it came from Robin. Yeah. It came from Robin. Yeah. Jonathan, my laptop's booting up. Do you have that access? Yeah, hold on. Let me see here. Here's one of them. So I will just forward it to Jim. Yeah. I'm Jim at mainsequence.net. Okay. So is Main Sequence still under the same ownership it's been under for years and years? Yep. Yep. Still the same ownership, but no changes there. So is he still surfing? Yeah, not as much, I think. He's been here for most of the summer. All right. I just forwarded it. You all run an older antiquated pricing system. Actually the pricing that you're paying per user for I think it was literally one nickel more per user per month. You could get the premium plus with PCRM, our new product. You could get everything the PC Recruiter offers for a nickel more than what you're paying out per month per user. Let's learn about that and see i...
