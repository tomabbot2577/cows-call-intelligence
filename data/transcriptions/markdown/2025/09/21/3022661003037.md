## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, good morning, Garrett. I have a couple different things that I need help with on PCR, and I don't know if it's at your level or, you know, it has to be extradited higher. First and foremost, I'm getting ready to do a large data dump from a company called MindScope through Mr. Lombardo and a guy named Mike on the back end, I guess. But my question is, in order to prepare for that, like, terabyte of information going in there with attachments, CSV files, all that kind of stuff, is there a way to compartmentalize company data in PCR? Like under my database, Healthcare Match Now, is there a way to compartmentalize groups or organizations so that they can kind of view and use their own information separately? Oh, so like siloing? Maybe. So like you want them to be able to only see certain records when they log into the database? Correct. Yes, there is a way to do that. It's called the groups feature. It's a security permissions feature where you would assign, you would build out a couple groups in the same area that you would build out new usernames. and then you can assign the group to be, you know, anybody in this group only has permission to see records assigned to that group. And then you would go record by record and assign them to that group. Okay, so if we're doing like a mass CSV or something like that, obviously there's some field mapping and things like that that can go in there. which field would you match a map to the group to like isolate it to that group like i understand first name last name email those are all relatively common sense right um it would be the username field actually on the record would be switched to the name of the group that you created in your database and then it would fall under that group and then any username is um you know attached to that group will be able to just see those records that are attached to the group. Got it. Okay, so I create a group, call it like, I don't know, Company A, whatever. Right. I assign users that already have seats in PCR to that group and then restrict them to see only those groups. Would that be correct? Right, exactly. Okay. And then when I bring in either new data or old data or whatever, I can assign that to username slash group company A, and they will all map or whatever you want to call it with all the additional fields and name, resume, and all that. But they'll map under that group company A. So everybody assigned to company A will have access to and manipulable of that group of data. Right. Yes, that's one way people do it. Kind of more often, though, you could just build multiple databases. There's no extra charge to have multiple databases with PCR. So you could just set up a whole separate database and then have them log into that. Sometimes that's a little less tricky than the group's setup. But if you were intent on just kind of having that one database with everything in it, then you could use the groups feature. I'm curious about the database, multiple databases. I never knew that was even possibly an option. Yeah, absolutely. So, would it be possible to have something like, okay, one, let's say, massive database that has everything, right? I mean, just because of the historical data or whatever. And then create like two more like sub databases with a slice of that database assigned to that so that that particular sub database, let's say, can grow and continue to emerge or whatever. yeah um definitely so you would it wouldn't be like a sub database where um it it won't like update the large database as the sub databases get updated they'll just be kind of separate so you'll have maybe that old one with historical data like you said the mass giant database and then you can create two separate databases and put in whatever you want in those but they will They will not be linked where, you know, I make a change on this record. It only gets changed in that database, if that makes sense. Ah, okay. All right. So talk me through that, or you can do it for me if you like, but try and learn as much as I can through you guys so that you don't have to keep doing stuff for me. No worries. So actually, to create an additional database, that's something our tech team would have to do. So we would just open a ticket and have them build you an additional database. And yeah, like I said, there's no charge. And then, yeah, feel free to start filling that up. But if you are working with Mike Keyes on doing like kind of a conversion, like you mentioned from MindScope, maybe that would be something to bring up to him so he could actually bring the data in to kind of create the database. Yeah. So he might actually be the best person to create the database and move it over. I can check for you. One second. I don't know what his schedule is. I mean, you guys obviously are doing stuff on the backside there. And I have one other thing I probably need your help wit...
