## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling META Engineering and Technical Services. For the dial by name directory, press 9. For the operator... Thank you for calling Michael McClain. Please hold while I try to connect you. . . . AI is taking notes. Hello, Mike? Yeah, hello? Yeah, it's Jim with PC Recruiter. Hey, Jim, how you doing? I am well. Your AI lady answered first before you could even speak. She interrupted and said, AI is taking notes. It's taking notes, yes. Yes, through our Ring Central, we have AI notating. Can you hear me okay, Nick? Real well, real well. I sometimes am a little quiet at first, just with this headset. Well, I went to put my earbud in, but it's not seeming to connect. So all good, all good. Yeah, well, I wanted to follow up on... Go ahead. Can you hear it? Okay. Yeah, I hear you. So I got your email earlier this week and kind of wanted to circle back about the AI. And I understand you had some interest in PCRM. So kind of wanted to talk and answer questions, see what you were thinking you wanted to do, and help get that moved forward. Yeah, yeah. I see Nick sent a voicemail yesterday, I don't know, 4 or 4.30. I haven't got a chance to get back to him today yet to talk about that PCRM. Yeah. But I was working with Garrett earlier last week and earlier this week with that AI stuff. So they were supposed to, I haven't heard anything yet, but they were supposed to upgrade all our databases to the Lucene. Okay. And they were going to enable the AI search feature for all the databases. But they said that was a trial thing. and then yeah just to reach out to you to get some costing and details of timelines and all that so yeah for sure for sure and yeah so that that AI search they didn't put it in everyone by default because they needed to be Lucene do they see are some of your databases Lucene I would have thought some of them would have been I don't know I got back to Garrett he said he was going to reach out to the tech team and let them know. And there was a little bit, he said there was a little bit of issue with users not able to use certain functions while the new database was indexing or Lucene was indexing. So I had asked them if they could try to do the changes like at night or over a weekend or something like that so that it indexes and we don't have any issues with our users. Yeah. If they kick that off, it'll like as soon as they kick it off the keyword search doesn't work and then it'll slowly as it re-indexes it'll work you'll have more and more data and the pool of searchable data will grow as that goes so it's not that anything doesn't work okay yeah okay when you're doing a search like if you do a search right as it started it's going to kind of be searching on the re-indexed new pool of data so it's small and then it's going to increase as it goes so it might take a little okay i misunderstood okay i thought it was we were completely we wouldn't be able to have certain search features until it completely indexed. So as we've seen indexes, it, okay, okay, I got this. Yeah, and your search would look a little bit different once it's done. It's still going to work the same, but it has a nicer display. It allows for searching of attachments, so it gives you some additional options there. Okay. So I'll check with him and see kind of where things stand on that. If you were looking to, so the AI is included and rolled into the PCRM package. So if you went with the PCRM, it includes the AI. And what that's going to do, how it works now is we would create a whole separate link for all of your databases. So you'd actually have a PCRM link. You would still have that, but you'd also have the piece or you'd still have a PCR9 link, but you'd also have a PCRM link. So you could actually have people using the same database from both versions because it's not a conversion or an overwrite or anything like that. So it's kind of neat. It just gives you the PCRM so everyone could use it or they could still hunt back into 9 if they felt they needed to. Now is 9 something that you guys are going to continue to keep and upgrade and apply all the features and stuff to? Or eventually will 9 be faded out and PCRM will be taken over? Well, as of right now, 9 is, there's no end of life even forecasted. And many of the updates that they're putting in, they're putting in both versions. So nothing at all. Now, that's not to say that five, six, seven years down the road, we find that most people have migrated on their own over to PCRM, that they might eventually end of life it, but there's no plans to do that right now. Okay. Okay. So to do it, what would be the cost to do it? There's a setup of 350, and that is the one-time setup that create the PCRM link, and that also includes four hours training. So four hours training on the new piece. That would also include the AI. So the AI would be there. And the AI also works in 9-2. So that's going to work in both capacities there. So $3.51 time, and then it's an additional ...
