 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, just press pound to continue. you. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, this is John. How are you? I'm well, John. How are you? I'm doing well. All right. Yeah. So I want to show you around a demo of PC Recruiter a little bit. And I think you said you used it in the past. So you're somewhat familiar with it. so just kind of wanted to see did you have any specific questions or areas of interest or yeah yeah I think there's a couple things um that I was curious about to see if things have changed it's been two to three years since I've last used it um but when I was using it prior to that I had been using it for about five years straight so definitely familiar with what I know but if there are any changes, there was a couple of things I'd be curious to learn. One being when it comes to like linking email addresses, things of that nature, and just sending out like marketing emails, does it cost extra to like link my Microsoft Outlook email with PCR so that it goes through that email address? Or I guess how do I go about doing that? Okay, certainly, certainly. Yeah, That would be, I don't know, did you use our email campaigns and or sequencing back then? Sequencing, I don't know. Yeah, we used the email campaign. Emails were around. They were a little newer than that. Perfect, perfect. So, yeah, let me share my screen. I'll kind of roll through here as I answer your question. So there is no cost to hook PC Recruiter up with your Outlook. Okay, so when you're utilizing the system here, and let me get into my database here. Do you see my screen okay? Yep, looks good. All right. All right. So if you're looking at the screen, when you email out a PC recruiter, be it individual, in bulk, even as part of a sequence, when you go and you send your email, you would have to set up an alias. Yeah. So you would need to set up wherever your email is coming from. In this case, I have a Gmail account showing up in there, or I might even have an alias, maybe a different one that's Outlook. So you could hook that up. Sure. That's something that you need to do, no extra cost to do it. Part of the setup is we would help you to set that up. So, yes, you can hook that up. There is an Outlook integration if you're on a PC. There's an Outlook integration that some people use. It used to be a separately billed product, but now it's rolled into all of our packages called the portal. Oh, okay. So that is the piece that you can open up, and you can actually open PC Recruiter inside of Outlook. So it gives you a little extra, syncs your calendar automatically. But the biggest thing people want to do with email is simply be able to email out of PC Recruiter from their Outlook address and then have those emails that come back in be tagged into the database. So if I looked at, for example, your record in my database, I use PC Recruiter, and I can see any emails I've sent right there and any emails you might have sent back are going to come as email received. So they're automatically right there. Okay. So that'll work with Outlook or any other mail-compatible program. Now, if you're emailing out a PC, you could be sending an email campaign. You can also opt to utilize another, like a send grid or something like that. If you wanted to be able to email it, it'll still come from you. It just doesn't come from your actual Outlook address, but it'll return to your Outlook address and it'll appear to come from you. So in that case, when you send your email campaign, you just pick your other, your send grid alias or whatever other alias you wanted. Maybe you want to email it from an inbox ad or something like that. So you could do that too. Yeah, perfect. Yeah, because that was actually part of my next question when it comes to setting up like a roll up or something of that nature. What does it look like to, I guess the big things I would want to be sure to, I guess, just see and understand to make sure things make sense on my end is to, one, what does it look like to import contacts from like an Excel spreadsheet? and then from there creating a group or a roll-up of those contacts and then last you know previewing a bulk email or something of that nature for sure for sure so so yeah so as you know we have a generic file importer so anywhere you might have a file you can go to the quick add up here and you can pull in a list of companies whatever so we'll do names for now i would simply go to import list now the nice thing about this is the very first thing it does is it requires you to put it on a roll-up list so your roll-up list is either already there or you can create one down at the bottom you can add roll up and I could date it today's date let's say so okay if I create a new role since I could do that or maybe I want to add them to my bulk test I can just go...
