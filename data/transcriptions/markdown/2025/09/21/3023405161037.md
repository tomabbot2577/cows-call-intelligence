## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hey, I'm trying to get the – hey, this is Gus Cawley with Staff Financial here in Atlanta. My resume inhaler is not working off my inbox. I was wondering if you could help me with that. Okay. Inhaler working off of the portal inbox? You're using the Microsoft OLIC portal? Yeah. okay this could be an issue with either the inhaler credentials or perhaps the outlook portal credentials do you use the outlook portal for anything other than inhaling not really okay uh well that tells me that you're probably not using the portal so maybe it's the maybe it's like an issue with the portal maybe we just need to like re-look at your portal connection because like the inhaler once you're once the inhaler is set up and doing a thing, it's kind of like you have to go in and change it in order for it to change what it's doing, right? Well, I get it to inhale files from a folder, and I just got a new laptop, and after I got my new laptop, I never could figure out how to set up the inhaler on the Outlook. Okay. All right, well, let's take a look. I guess we could do a screen share. I could help you get set up? That would be awesome. Thank you. Would you like to go to meet.google.com for me and I'll give you a 10 letter code to join my meeting? Sure. Go ahead. I'm pretty bad at the phonetic alphabet. So hopefully we can do this without it. But So the 10-letter code, when you go to meet.google.com, in the middle of the screen, it says enter code. It's going to be S-R-K-A-O-N-C-G-U. And when you join, make sure to mute yourself and turn your camera off. We don't need that. We just need the screen share capability. Okay. I will admit you to the meeting and then from there if you could please go to the share screen button at the bottom of the screen there we go and it is share your entire screen so I could see everything not just a window all right great okay okay all right what first thing I noticed is that you're using Outlook inside of the web but but I've got another one here okay good okay good great okay gotcha yeah okay that's what we're looking for all right is this oh is this a newer version I see I think I'm kind of I'm not as savvy on the phones as many of the other support members but I think that this version of Outlook is not currently compatible with our current version of portal. You need to use like a legacy Outlook. Let me see if I can find information. Yeah. Just tell me where to go and I'll go get the legacy. Okay. Let me see if I can find that. We provide a legacy download for that. Downloads. I might have to ask a colleague of mine to... Here it is. The PC Recruiter for Outlook plugin supports classic desktop versions of Outlook from 2010 to 2021 in Office 365. Maybe it lied to me. Man, you found that quickly. Where did you find that, if you don't mind me asking? Google. Oh, that was just, you just, Google AI has us figured out already? I said legacy Outlook that works with main sequence PC recruiter software. Oh, does it give you a download link? That's amazing. Resume inhaler. So let me just do that. I'm going to do that. And then PC recruiter for Microsoft Outlook? No. Let me go back and ask it again. Do you mean legacy Outlook that works with main sequence PC? Yes, yes, I do. But these are PC recruiter downloads, not the... I need a download link for the old Outlook app. Thank you. Thank you. I'm trying all the avenues I have at my disposal right now. It is from 5 to 6, so I am like the only one really on right now. So it's kind of tough. No worries. I appreciate your help. Microsoft. I'm searching in my Discord here. Yeah, I got all these emails coming in, and I've been having to manually import them one by one. It's no fun. Yeah, the portal will help definitely with that once we get it figured out. It should be this one. How do you find that? It's here on the Learning Center. Okay. Installing PCR for Outlook. It's on our Learning Center apparently. it's on the the PCR for Outlook Learning Center article on our page PCR for like FOR Outlook should be the title of it I think PCR for Outlook main sequence and then Right here. Right? Oh, sorry. I'm not looking at your screen anymore. Okay, I'm back. Okay, I can see you need to sign in as Gus at stafffinancial.com. The screen, I don't see. I don't see any download screen or download links currently on your screen. How do I log in here? You mean in Outlook? I see Outlook. I go to the Learning Center. Do I go to the Learning Center? I don't see a screen that is showing. uh the learning side oh hold on two seconds i'm over here yeah yeah okay that makes sense all right so yeah okay so yeah search for um what was it pcr for outlook and then on there that will give you a bunch of different they're all for pcr for any of those works those are all part of it uh so then scroll down to the like the third or fourth section under I think you went past it. It'll be right under that ...
