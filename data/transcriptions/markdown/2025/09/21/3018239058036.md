## 💬 Full Transcript

 Please hold while I try to connect you. Hello, this is Jake with Sanford Rose IT. Hi, Jake. This is Robin Mantoni with Main Sequence. You left a message. I'm going to help you with. I'm having some technical issues. that needs help doing setup activities, how to monitor them, how to, we got somebody who when they send an email, it tracks like seven different times and it's like, fuck that. Sorry for cussing. It's been a long day. But we basically I've had that and I get it. But yeah, we basically just wanted to get it to track properly and I don't even know if she's around to be honest with you since 4.30. So let me message her and see if she's even still here. Yeah, maybe I do. Okay, so is it like one of the offices. Do you know who we're talking about? I can see what's going on. I don't know. It's Allison Boyson, but let me... Let's hold off on getting her real quick. Let's just see if we can figure some things out. Oh, it's Sunnyside. Music team integration. Does that sound right? B-O-Y-S-O-N? Yes. Okay. Let's see. Do you want to know her username? Her username should be A-Boyson and it should be MosaicTeamIntegration.com but I don't know what their PCR would be. Let me see. Why am I not getting in here? Okay. I'm going to close a bunch of windows so I don't confuse myself. Okay, so system users. Oh, she just used this admin. Okay. So what did she describe the issue as? I'm going to check her. uh the issue was that like uh emails and phones and the way they track um stuff it's like over tracking like if they send like an email it tracks like five times and they just want like a good way to like you know yeah okay all right so let's see let me see something here i wonder if Okay, figure, there's one mail server. Okay. So, see send email to sent items folder. Okay, that's fine. Okay, wasn't what I was thinking there. So they send one email that writes multiple activities. Does she give you an example of any chance? Yes, she did. Give me one second. So basically, like, with emails, like, if she sends one out, it's like she sends an email out at 7, and it says, here it is, 7-15-2025-12 a.m. Email was sent from Allison Boyce and email was sent from Allison Mosaic team. Email was sent to this. Email was sent from Allison Mosaic team. And it basically just got like six entries for essentially one email. And what we're wondering is we don't want that because it gives the impression that like a lot is being done when it's really just one. So it's the writing of activities though, right? Okay. Yes. Who is the person she emailed? Does she give you an example or what was the date of it? The date was 7-15-2025. Yeah. Okay. Let me go. Let me do an activity search for yesterday. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. And I can give you one of the emails that was sent to. Oh, that'd be perfect. Okay. Tichellem at gmail.com. So T-L-S-C-H-E-L-L-E-M at gmail. Say that again. T-L-S-E-L-L-E-M. Did I hear that right? Tango, Lima, Sierra, Charlie, Hotel, Echo, Lima, Lima, Echo. E-M. Mountain. Yeah. T-L-S-E-H-E-L-L. Let me try doing a search that way, see what I come up with. Thank you. tomorrow okay interesting let's see do you know by any chance if she happens to have the same date does she also use the outlook portal added I assume so, yes. Okay. I wonder if she has PCR mail set to write activities and the Outlook portal. Because I'm only getting two activities for that one email. But that possibly, because one does have an Outlook ID and the other does not. Do you mind if we loop her into this call? Sure. Yeah, I think we just got to turn off a setting in her Outlook portal. Okie dokie then. Let me go ahead and get her added to this real quick. Okay. Perfect. Not a problem. Hello. Hi. How are you doing, Allison? Pretty good. How are you all doing? Oh, I'm ready to go home. but I think I know what could be going on do you also use the Outlook portal add-in the piece or critical and I look okay like when you're when you're in your Outlook like are you able to like do you have the ribbon where you could right-click parse the resume oh I think okay I think I think it would be better if we get a screen share going because not just the email she also had some questions about the calls as well. I thought I forgot to mention that, but I honestly think it'd be better for all of us if we get in a screen share because I think she can show you better what she's seeing and that should give you a better idea of what we're trying to correct. Okay. Yeah. I'm pretty sure. I think I know at least for the emails why it's happening. I think you have your, it sounds like you have the Outlook portal because one's writing with like an ID number and the other ones do not. And so I think one's writing, you have PCR mail and the Outlook portal and in both writing activities. So if we turn one off, then you don't have those duplicating each other. Do you guys have RingCentral? We do. Okay. So if you want to open up your RingCentral app and select video and then g...
