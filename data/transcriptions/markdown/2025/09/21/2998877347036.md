## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Yeah, I was hoping you could help me. I'm signing up to use SourceWale, and there are some settings and some customizations I think I may need to make in PCR. I'm not sure where to make those. Are they asking for an app ID and API password? I did that part already. I'm beyond that. I'm at like setting up like contact stages and contact fields. And there are, I'm not exactly sure where to add some of these like contact stages. Yeah, I'm not sure what they use. Are they referring to activity types or? So I think that's what, I think they're custom activity types maybe. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure on what they do for setup, but they're trying to use an activity type. Then those would be created in PCR under system. If you go to database setup, and then there would be a section called activity types. This database setup. There's activity. I see activity but not activity type. Oh, there's activity types. Okay. Okay. And then, like, the ones that we already have, like, I don't see those listed anywhere. So there are some things that are generated automatically. So, like, add name, edit name. But then you could do, like, custom ones, like left message, things like that. So that would be, like, if you're in your add activity screen. Okay. Can I just have somebody, like, connect to my computer and show what they're asking me to do and what we have? Yeah, I mean, we could do that. You might need to go back to Sourcewheel. I'm not really sure, but maybe we could figure it out from what they're looking for on their screen. Do you have a RingCentral? Do you prefer a Google Meet? GoogleMeet. I have RingCentral, too. Okay, so if you open up RingCentral. Open up your RingCentral app and you go to video. Give me one second. RingCentral. Open. Sign in. You guys are the only ones we use this for. Thank you. Okay. open ring central okay it's opening sign is Okay, I'm in RingCentral. Okay, so when you go to video up at the top left, you'll select join and it's going to ask you for a meeting ID. Let me know when you're ready for that number. Video, join, text. Okay. Meeting ID is going to be 050 394 810. 050. Okay. All right. Perfect. Okay. So since we're on the phone you don't need to join with computer audio you might want to mute that if it starts giving you kind of like a little echoing um but what i'm going to have you do is click share at the bottom of your screen and then it's going to pop up a window asking what to show so you want to make sure you're under entire screen and if you have more than one monitor make sure you select which one you want to share with me. Yep. And then click share with a net pop-up. Okay. So what are they asking you for? Just activity types? So, yeah. So whenever you... Contacts can move through. You can map them to stages in PC Recruiter. Source stage, click stage, reply stage. Well, let's go in that drop-down. I don't know what they're referring to for stages. Called, can't find, contact email. Okay, so these appear to be activity types, or they roll up stages. Let's see. Throw down a little bit more. Yeah, they're not the – so these are the ones that we have in our roll-ups. Okay, so maybe that's what they're looking for. I don't think they are because... So let me... Roll ups. so that list I think mirrors this list okay but they're not looking for the roll up stages are there that's a contact field okay so This context stages, I think they are looking for roll-up stages. So in case you're using their source wheel integration on a particular list, it can change stage icons for you. So I believe that's what this is looking for. And then the other things at the left might be something else. So if you wanted it, it sounds like it doesn't have to do anything, but it's optional. this section because they say this section is optional you don't need to map everything to a stage so that appears to be optional so yeah like she was saying that um like the source stage is not one that we'd want to use but like message like if we send somebody a message through source whale we would want that to i assume you have to use a roll-up list to kind of initiate someone in SourceWheel. So that's what I believe. It'll show up in the activities. So that appears to be something different, though, because that looks like it's looking for roll-up stages. Because it also said stage 0 or stage 10, which would not be an activity type. So that appears to be roll-up stages. So let's go back to your SourceWheel integration. so this appears to be looking for roll-up stages let's look at right above that under activity notes so this is probably your activity types which you don't have any so if you did initial email and you wanted it to write a specific activity type seems to me you'd have to go under where I just had you under system, database setup, activity types, and create something that would complement these if you wanted to write an activity in PC Recruiter. Yeah. So...
