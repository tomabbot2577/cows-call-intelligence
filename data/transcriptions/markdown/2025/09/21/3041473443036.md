## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hey, Mackenzie. I'm Connie Rose. I'm on the system under Connected Services, and I'm using the roll-up function. Okay. I want to try to track how many calls a day, because when you get calling and calling and calling inside your database, by the end of the day, you're a little punchy, you know? and I went into I did some research and I went into roll ups and I went into activities but I can't see when I look over at results it just shows how many is in my roll up I can't really find exactly how many I called on a particular date is that available? I mean I know the admin can see it but I want to be able to see it because I have a goal and I don't want to have to count one, two, three, you know, down the list, because I make, I'm coming up to speed, and I'm making a lot of calls now, so I don't really want to have to hunt it down, you know. Sure, give me one second. Let me get to where you're at here. I can look, and I can see a lot of the ones I called today, but then at the very top, I see Grace Reagan, and I don't think I called her today. I know I called her, but it was Monday or something. What is the username that you log in as? I don't know. Zerose or something like that? It is. Maybe just where's PCR? You're on here somewhere. Username is Connie. Okay. Password is, you need the password? You don't have to tell me that. I didn't figure, but I don't care. It's just work. You got all the information anyhow. Yeah, we log in. There's a way to track who logs in, and I log in with my password as a main sequence employee. So you could actually track me logging into your database with that. So I don't log in with your username and password. I log in with your username but my password. It's like an over. Yeah. Are you there? Hello? Hello? I lost you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Sorry. Yeah, I'm here. I lost you for a minute. Hello? Yeah, I'm here. Oh, my gosh. One second. I really despise RingCentral's controls for this. One second. Because it's connected to RingCentral, and I came over here, and I'm like, okay. Let me just pause. Okay. I'm so sorry. Because you can look for something forever, and it's late at night. I can hear you now, and you can hear me now again. Sorry. Right. Yeah. All right. Sorry, I always get mixed up. The audio settings are so frustrating in the RingCentral app. Tell me about it. We had trouble today. I noticed that RingCentral wouldn't dial out the first time. Like, it would dial, but I wouldn't get a voicemail or I wouldn't get a person. I'm like, hello, hello. And it did that two, three times today. And then I get a message from my admin, the administrator on the account, and he goes, this guy with this number you called him but somehow when he called back he got me and i left my mobile number for ring central i mean i left that number i don't know about that for me it's the cord on my microphone like i i'll hit it and it'll short and then it just completely loses the microphone and then i have to re-establish it but the screen is just annoying right three different there's a there's a speaker and microphone combination setting but then there's a microphone setting and a speaker setting like we don't need all three of those you could just have two one for microphone one for speaker keep it there and i changed the combo setting and like my microphone is not a speaker my microphone can't be a speaker it's a microphone so i select that and then i can't hear you and then i you know it's just so it's just frustrating Sorry about that. Anyway, so I'm logged in as you. I'm on a roll-up, and I want to ask this again. So you're trying to find out how many people you've called today? Today. That's your goal? That's it. Yeah, I mean, I see the different options. Call, but we don't want all because I've been calling a lot since I got here. Miss, I don't want that. And it says edit. Miss outgoing or incoming. But if I do that, but, you know, it looks like it's going to tally everything I've done from day one, and I don't really want that. How do you, what clicks do you take inside PCR to see that, like that you're talking about now? I want to see like what you're doing and adjust it. Well, in PCR, I have a roll up. And I just go to the person's name and open up the profile and I just go to their cell phone and dial it straight from the PCR platform. And it rings the ring, you know, dials out the ring central. but I don't see anywhere I can track my daily activity. I mean, it may not matter to some people, but it matters to me. That may not be a functionality that I make it say to be, oh, well. Would you want to see like every name that you have an activity for today? Is that something that would, like no matter what activity it was? no matter what activity it was. I mean, I know what the activity is because I'm choosing the activity. So I just want to know the number of people I've called, whether I had to leave a ...
