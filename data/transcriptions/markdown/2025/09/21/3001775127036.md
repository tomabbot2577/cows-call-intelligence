## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, Mackenzie. This is Melanie. I am calling because I'm having difficulty with PCR linking to my LinkedIn account. I'm sorry, PCR capture. Okay. Sure. What seems to be the issue when you're trying to log in and it doesn't log in? Or is there some other issue going on? I am, I had put it, it's up here on my browser right next to the URL code. So I can see PCR capture and then I click on it. I put my login information in there. And for some reason, you know, everything in here, capture, match, everything looks good. But then when I go into LinkedIn, it's not, I don't see the button, the PCR capture button on the right hand side. like it's supposed to show up. Okay. Interesting. I'm pulling up my capture tool here. So you are logged into the tool. Like when you click on the tool in the browser, it no longer shows you the login screen. It shows you like there's a tab that says capture, a tab that says match. There's a bunch of toggle switches. And then it'll have what your, it says current user at the bottom, current database at the bottom. So it is logged in. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Did you change any of the default settings when you installed it for the first time? No, I mean, I put Chrome as my default, but that's the only thing that I did. You said LinkedIn was having the issue. Yeah. I'm on, I'm trying to get it on the LinkedIn over here. So it shows up on the right-hand side. Are all of the toggle switches for LinkedIn turned on to the right and blue? In Capture, yep. And then in Match, same thing. Both LinkedIn and Indeed toggle switches are both on in those as well. Okay. Are you like a LinkedIn recruiter account? Are you paying for like the premium version of LinkedIn? Yes. I have LinkedIn Recruiter. Okay. That could be a reason why. Okay, let me get everything about... I might have to open a ticket for this because the capture tool is something that companies like LinkedIn and Indeed and those websites, they don't really like it. because it's, you know, like, LinkedIn does a lot of work in providing their service and their data, and, like, we're just, like, coming and scraping it, so they frequently change their website. Like, it's honestly, like, an ongoing battle of, like, our developers versus theirs, where our capture tool will work, and then, like, they'll make changes to their website, so our capture tool can no longer, like, find the elements on the page to, like, scrape the data from. And so then our developers have to go back and like re find like where, like what they did. So it could just be that it's been long enough to where like they finally pushed updates and change that again. And I have to look at it. And the problem with this sort of thing is that we don't have a LinkedIn recruiter account to log into. So, um, a lot of times, uh, like it's like, it's like thousands of dollars, right. to get one. And we don't, I mean, I guess we have a decent amount of people using it, but we really don't get the value of like having one. So sometimes we ask for access to the LinkedIn recruiter crowd just so our developer can like log in and see the page and like find the elements that they're looking for. Would you be open to that? If they did need to, like if they did, because I don't know if that's the case right now. I have to do more troubleshooting, but okay that's like all the thoughts that come up with just like what you said so what i want to do now is make sure i have all your information um i have a good description of like the issue and then i i think we i need to go back and like actually try and troubleshoot more with you um to make sure just yeah just to make sure that because like you've said you've done it but i actually see it um yeah so this is my this is my second day of work and my boss she's on teams me here i muted her but um she they all use this pcr capture um in their on their linkedin so this is something new for me so you have to walk me through because i have no idea i have a question but i was using microsoft edge and i put it in chrome do you think that matters I think Chrome is the preferable. Okay. I think we, like, our default mode is in Chrome. Like, everything we do is in Chrome here at MST. So it probably works better in Chrome. It should work in Edge. We support Edge, but Chrome is preferable. I am in Chrome. I do have an error on the top right hand of my screen in Chrome, though. I wonder maybe if that could be the issue. Yeah, there could be a lot of stuff. You said your name was Melanie. What company are you with, Melanie? Susan Graham Consulting. Yes, Susan Graham Consulting. You said it's your second day of work, so you haven't called here before. No. Okay. I'm going to put you in our system just so I can log the call and if you call again we have you Melanie would you like to give a last name Tanner it's T-A-N-N-E-R okay and do you have an email address or your work emai...
