## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling me. Tyler, how can I help? This is Bryant from JTL Services. Are you guys having issues with things being incredibly slow? We haven't had any reports yet this morning. Is there any particular thing you're doing within PC Recruiter that it's running slow? No, it's just navigating. I just tried to capture, and it's taken forever. I don't know what the deal is. I haven't tried using another browser, but it's just like I'm having no problem navigating through Chrome and doing other things. Oh, yeah, I'm seeing it on my end for your database, too. We're just trying to let me check with you. What's a good phone number for you? I can check to see if there's an issue going on. 919-995-2742. All righty. I will give you a call back as soon as I have an answer or as soon as that is resolved. Thank you, sir. Yep. Have a good one....
