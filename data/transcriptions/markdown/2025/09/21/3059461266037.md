## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you, technology. This is Eric. How are you? Yeah, this is Patricia Capanna. I was having trouble with PCR capture, and someone sent me an email saying uninstall it and reinstall it. Well, I uninstalled it, and now I can't reinstall it. Okay, yeah, that was me. I just replied back to your email. so that initial link I sent you just click on that it'll take you right to the installation page and then you'll hit add to Chrome okay that's what I didn't know because it said it's going to change my website if I added to it so I I did add it now it says removed from Chrome but I don't see it anywhere I don't know where to go it's already added I finally clicked it because I couldn't get ahold of it I didn't know what to do so I added it but it doesn't show up anywhere. So now I don't have that little corner up on my... Yeah, the next step would be to sign into the tool. So you would go to the top right of your browser. There'll be a white puzzle piece icon. Click on that. Wait a minute. Oh, way up at the top. Yeah. I've got one, two, three, five things. I don't know what it is. That's Dropbox. then I've got PCR with a C on it. Is that what I do? No, it'll, it'll be in your browser. Um, so are you using Google Chrome? Yeah. So, um, it's like a little white puzzle piece. Yeah. If you click on it, it'll show you your extensions in a list. You just want to pin the capture tool with the pin icon. Okay. There it is now. So am I, am I logged in then to it? If you click on the capture extension logo next to the puzzle piece, it'll either ask you for a PCR web address or if you're already signed in, it'll list a bunch of websites with toggles. OK. Oh, see, it does nothing. I click it and oh, there we go. Finally to PCR recruiter dot net. I got to log in again or what? This is my I'm already logged in the PCR. I don't get it. Enter your PCR site. I just take them forever. I can't get it to click to log in. Oh, so there's, yeah, if it just says my company, that's placeholder text. You'll have to actually replace that with your real web address for your company's login page. Oh, let me see where I go back there for that. No, dang it. I lost it. Oh, where, I need to start. All right. PCR. Yeah, no problem. Okay. Yeah, just open up PCR, copy the web address. All right. And then it's like the username again. Oh, my gosh. Yeah. So you're logged in on the PCR website, but we're just logging you into the PCR extension now so we can connect you with the extension to the right database and username. All right. Let's see. Incorrect username. Oh, great. Did you select a database from the dropdown in that third slot? Yep. MRI Madison, Maine. That's my main database. Incorrect username. My username is PAC. Okay. So it must be a password. I, I, I, incorrect username. Shit. Oh, God. Is it case sensitive? The password is case sensitive, yeah. Okay, there. I'm in. So what do I do with all these capture and matches? Because I have so much trouble with PC capture. It keeps creating new companies, duplicate names. What am I doing wrong? Should I be under match or capture? So what you're looking at now is just a menu. It's the capture menu. So nothing in there really needs to be changed except for when you initially opened the ticket today, it was about everybody was going to your default company. So there is a toggle at the bottom right that says capture to default company. You might want to turn that off so people aren't automatically... Okay, good. It's off. Basic mode and dark mode are both off. And then what is the match? Match, that's just letting you know what websites the capture match feature works on. The match feature is just a little icon that'll appear to the right of somebody's name to let you know that they might already be in your database when you're looking through LinkedIn. So this can work then now? Like if I go to... Yeah. Yeah. Close that menu at the top right and then go to LinkedIn. And there are some steps that you can take to make sure that a duplicate isn't created. So maybe pull up somebody on LinkedIn that you think already exists in your database. All right. That's me. I'm already existing. Awesome. So you'll see it says click to update on the right instead of click to add. No, it says click to add. It says click to add. It doesn't say click to update. I got the link right out of my database. Oh, gotcha. Okay. So if you click on that, what do you see on the PCR capture tool? Hold on. It takes forever. Okay. I see search possible matches. Select duplicate to update merge. Use default company is off. I mean, I see my name there. That's a possible match. Okay. But it doesn't ask me to match or, I mean, it didn't. So, what? So, if I click that, it says use Patricia's company is off and use default company is off. Okay, yeah, so what you're looking at is the duplicate checking screen in the capture tool. Up top, it's listing different records in your database already that might be a match. So you would just click ...
