## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Integrity Bookkeeping. This is Melissa. Can I help you? Hi, Melissa. Is Kathy available? Just one second. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello? Hi, it's Robin. How are you? Hey, Robin. I'm doing okay. Do you have a moment to chat? Or are you in the middle of something? It's okay. Yeah. What's your name? So I'm kind of getting my ass chewed up. but a little bit of an ass-chewing about international cut. Well, not really. It started sounding like that, but then I don't know if it's really me. So Bill was saying we have to get this stuff addressed with the international. And I'm like, well, I don't really know some things. And it was kind of like, it's been three months. You should know by now. So when I said, well, some things are like a little weird, and you're like, I don't care about that. you know so don't want to hear about how anything was done before and I just have to learn how to do it right it was kind of the tone I got in so many words so let me pull up what did I need to ask you so as far as um these international people when it comes to somebody wanting to pay international because like most of them i'm finding now like the country drop down is throughout so i think i've got a good handle on those except for that gabby i don't know maybe it was just her card didn't like us i don't know yeah but for other people i it's better than it was like remember how country drop down was missing in many places so so far those are okay now let me see what was i supposed to ask you about though Not that one. Next up. This is it. Okay. So this Laboratorious Saval, S-A-V-A-L is the easiest way. I guess they normally would like to pay by wire. And then what I was saying, well, if they want to pay by wire, I think Kathy has to generate that. And it's like an encrypted link. Is that correct? Yeah. Yeah. Because that's what I've been doing recently because we have to actually send them the actual bank routing and account number. And it's not safe to just send that in a regular email because you're basically just opening up your exact account information to the World Wide Web, basically. You know, anyone that can intercept that message from here, you know, to their place and anywhere in between. then can get your banking information. So I've been sending it with a secure and an encrypted email. I don't know if you can do encrypted email on your end or not, but my secure document management allows me, you know, to send encrypted emails through Outlook. And so I've been sending them that way so that I make sure that I'm not exposing main sequences account information to somebody that, you know, could intersect a straight email. Okay. Is it possible, I guess? So, I mean, I don't know the limitations. And I'm like, well, I think some of them were because of the situation. So I'm just kind of like going blind here. Okay. So is that like for every payment unique or is it just like one thing that's? like no i just have to send it i just have to send them the the the banking information so they can set it up with their bank to send an international wire okay so so once they have it they have it would okay once have it now we can also though we can also send them um if they had paid previously in QuickBooks, we can send the invoice directly from QuickBooks with a link for them to pay. And QuickBooks doesn't seem to have any problems with international payments. So we can switch those. Now, I guess they were always a wire. Would that have been done? Because I never took care of the wires before. Yeah. And this is where I start getting in trouble. Well, you've got to figure it out now. Like, I never did the wires. Like, I don't. Yeah. That's not your, that's not your, that's not your, you're not in the finance. you know, stuff. That's not something you would have had or been responsible for. So I hear that they're, you know, they're kind of grouping jobs and stuff like that because they're just trying to, you know, to get through. But you don't have access to the account. I'll see, check on those things and things like that. And why would you want to place that burden on you? I don't want to either. Okay. I'm just trying to, like, not be in trouble. because I had to do a call with Tino who does some of these international accounts and I'd be like, well, what's the email I'm supposed to be sending it to? I don't know. It's not the most pleasant call. What was that one with L? It's a name. Yeah, just say Saval, S-A-V-A-L, and then you'll find it. Laboratorios, I don't even know how to say that. I know, I don't either. so yeah they're bouncing from like one to another I'm like they were making me dizzy in the call I'm like no let's talk about one at a time yeah okay yeah this one overdue partially paid forty dollars and then so I'm not the and then then I also brought up I go and I think she was also wanting to do something about the wire fee because otherwise, like, oh, Bill, you lose $20 or somethi...
