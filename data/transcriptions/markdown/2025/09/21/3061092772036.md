 hello hi Courtney yes it is hi Courtney this is Robin Montoni with main sequence hi Robin how you doing I'm good you have some kind of billing question but I don't know any details sorry about that well I mean yes I do have a billing question so I've kind of just been on auto bill for about the last year so I haven't really even so much as logged in I'm not really working currently and so So, and it was when I turned it back on, it was from an old contract. So I don't even really know, like, my terms. So I'm calling to find out what I would need to do to be able to give notice on my contract and what that looks like. Okay. Let me see. I know I just had I think it's the 12th or the 15th is my billing date it all depends on the agreement though your agreement is it goes and they automatically renew What the heck did they do here? I don't know. It's probably really old. I haven't seen anything in years. 2021. But I think whoever did this made a little mistake, and I'm trying to figure it out. Initial term disagreement is, will begin on November 12, 2021 and terminate, how does it terminate the same day and have no term? What do they do? I'm going to have to look into this one. What I recall, I think I had to give a month, it was like a month's notice or something, but I didn't know, like, you know. Yeah, and normally what they do is they go, this is an initial license agreement. Normally they're one year or three years. now your original one unless that was literally something else that maybe just an update the original one was a one year agreement I'm going to have to ask Jim Lombardo about this or probably should have you talk to your account manager Jim Lombardo I'm not really sure there was an agreement in 2014 and then something like a re-sign in 2021. But I'm not sure on the wording with this what the duration is because it looked like they, at least by accident, put the same dates in. I'm not really sure what to do there. Can I have Jim Ligardo reach out to you? Sure, that would be fine. Yeah, I mean, I'm not working. We've had a death in the family. Like, I just need to close things out, and I just need to know what to do. And you can look at my usage. Like, I've maybe logged in once or twice just to look up a piece of it. But, like, I'm not using the product. And you can, you know, you'll be able to see that from a user log. All right. In years. All right, let's see. I'm going to have him reach out because I'm not really sure on that. I don't really do the contract so much. I kind of know how to make one, but let me figure this out, and I'm going to have Jim reach out to you. That sounds fine. Thank you. All righty. Thank you....
