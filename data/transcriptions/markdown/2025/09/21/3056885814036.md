## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. Otherwise, you are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good morning. This is Jim. How are you? Hey, Jim. How are you? I'm pretty well. Hey, Digit. Okay, I think we're just waiting on... Hello, Sean. Hello. Rough morning, eh, Sean? Honestly, it was a rough night. It was a very rough night. It was, you know, top three worst moment as a parent, you know, so far. Yes. But she avoided surgery so far, and we're good. Jim, his daughter got injured last night. I don't know what the circumstances were. She likes to drag a kiddie slide over to climb the tree in our backyard, which she's pretty good at, but not as 100% as we learned last night. when she fell on her right arm and broke it and dislocated her elbow. Oh, no. Please. Yes. So. That is no good. Not great. She'll be starting kindergarten in a cast. But she's a lefty, thankfully, and she broke the right arm. So we've got, you know, she's got that going for her at least. Well, at least that's good. That's good. I don't know it was oh there's Brian now okay so yes I think as I understand it you are joining KVIC and you're going to be converting your bullhorn database into PC recruiter that's kind of right okay okay that's all I know so I am more the more information the better Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll, because I think the details will matter here. So, Higher Minds was acquired by Starfish Partners. and a portion of our team, specifically our life sciences group, is and has already merged with the Kay Bassman, what they call the alliance team run by Michael Petrak and Jim Brennan. And so those folks are looking to take their legacy data from Bullhorn, migrate that over into PCR, so that they're not flip-flopping between the PCR database that they're using as part of the Alliance team and the legacy data in Bullhorn. That said, there are a number of us who are staying as Higher Minds branded employees and we'll continue to use Bullhorn. And so what you're going to be working with us on is we're going to send the whole database and then we'll figure out how to, you know, we're going to use you to help us figure out how to parse out the pieces that they need for that life sciences team. And who knows, maybe over time, the whole team will migrate, but right now it's the life sciences group. Okay, perfect. So we'll take that Bullhorn data, we'll convert it all in. I would presume it's going to be a separate database for starters, and then once it's converted, then you can kind of decide what you want to keep or delete or use or anything like that. Brian, you're with us, right? Yes, and that's correct. So a separate database will parse out what needs to be moved over to the alliance group, and then we can hide that database at that point if we want to. Yeah, it'll be on the same URL, so you can easily just copy it on your own once you know what that is through roll-ups or anything like that and then hide it once it's done. And Brian, would you be signing for this one, the KBICS plan, the normal discount rate and everything like that? Yes, sir. Okay, so I'll get that drawn up and sent on over to you. And then once we get that signed, we'll get my keys on the job to get the data here and get everything started with the map and everything like that. So we can do that. And then did you add any users? Are you adding users to KBIC? Or I'll just work with Jessica on that as we do every month. Just with Jessica. I think we added two or three. But yeah, Jessica has the updated list. Yeah, every month when she gets it, she pops me a quick email. I send her a report and we kind of compare it. So that usually handles itself. That is good. Okay. And any other questions or anything around that? I think it's pretty straightforward what needs to happen, and I will get that over with. Well, Sean, I'll tell you what. Yeah, just in who we are. So I was the founder of Higher Minds, but Sean is the brains behind how a lot of the operations run, and he's our bullhorn expert and understands the mappings better than anybody. And so I've asked him to join us because I'm sure that there are going to be some judgment calls we have to make around mappings and things like that. And he is he's our resident expert. OK, so he would be the primary point once we get everything signed, get the data here. Sean would be the primary point for mapping questions to work with our team here to get that to get that going. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. That's good to know. And I will note that in the ticket. Mike Keys on our team kind of coordinates the data conversions. So he is the one who has the maps, has our standard maps, works to customize the maps and everything of that nature. Yeah. Good. Very well. Okay. Well, that's all I need on my end. I can go ahead and get things started today. Do you have the Bullhorn backup? Is it already pulled? Is it something you can easily get? I've already pulled it dow...
