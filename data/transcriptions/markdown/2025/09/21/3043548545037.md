## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I'm calling because one of the – I'm going to try and start an even thing. And I'm warning you, I am trying to describe something where my vocabulary does not meet the needs. No worries. Or my technical knowledge does not meet the needs. Okay. So I'm just going to warn you there. Did I lose you? Hello? Can you still hear me? Hello? But in this case, two users in question. And when I send a form letter as admin, the sender shows up the way that it's supposed to, which is it just says Shelly Herman, and then it says Shelly Herman, or it says her email address. And then when I send a form letter as me, the non-admin user, it shows like, you know, Outlook, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, crazy string of numbers sent on behalf of. And then it says my name and then it says my actual email address. And so the sender shows as this like cuckoo Outlook, you know, fabricated email. And then the reply to does show correctly. and I like to think of myself as somebody who, like, knows to, you know, turn it on and turn it off or, like, check the email settings. So I did that, you know, before calling you guys, and I noticed that the admin email setup in the database has, like, a different – Basically, there's like one thing where she can have the SMTP be directed to our server. And then for the outgoing, there's like a way to authenticate through Microsoft essentially. And then when I log in as me, I only have one little window where it says like email alias. And I only have one place to put an SMTP where the only way it'll send is if I send it through the Outlook SMTP, which is totally fine. and we do want to authenticate through that, but I want it to not show as that, you know, I want it to look like I'm just sending it, me personally. Okay. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? Yeah, let me sign in. It's your username, Margo? Yeah, and it's with a silent T. It's M-A-R-G-O-T, and I'm with Sally Herman and Associates. Perfect. Okay. And I'll just log in here and check on that. So we'll go to email, set up, email alias list. And I'm certain I just don't have something set right. But once I saw that I didn't have the same ability to even put in the same information as the admin one, I thought I'm out of my depth. Okay, yeah. Let's take a look. So let's get on a quick screen share and then I can kind of see the differences that you mentioned there. If I just maybe fire up a meeting with RingCentral here. So if you just want to go in a new tab in your browser to meetings.ringcentral.com. All right. I'm ready for an ID or personal link name at your... Perfect. The ID is 378-144-065. Awesome. I see join there. If it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. Perfect. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. Sorry, it's Chrome. Chrome doesn't think I should do this, so I have to go to my settings. I'm sorry about that. Okay, no worries. I'm going to have to quit and reopen the browser. Is it okay to just do the Chrome tab? Sure. Yeah, and if – yeah, we'll try it that way. That'll work. I'm sorry. Yeah, I mean, I will do that. If that doesn't work, I'll quit and relaunch and all of that. I just didn't want to make it. Yeah, this might work here. Okay, so yeah, I'm seeing your PCR pulled up, that tab. So let's jump over to where you were in your settings for, yeah, we'll go to system. Perfect. Would you like to, you're probably faster than I am. I actually don't have like mouse control or anything. I'm just. Got it. Okay. Sorry about that. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Okay. So system and then email setup. I'll go to email alias list. Perfect. Okay. I. I wish I had taken a screenshot of my screen, but I promise I called. like maybe, I don't know, a couple hours ago, this didn't exist here. Oh, outgoing mail settings? Wait. Oh, because I'm not in – oh, because I'm in admin. I'm so sorry. Let me log in. I think I know what the difference is. So outgoing mail settings specifically is for your database overall, to have an email address to send just general notification emails. The outgoing mail settings is not tied to any username. It's just your database uses it to send things like somebody requests a password reset. The database needs an email to send through. Your username is tied to your email alias list. That's specific to your... Okay, in that case, the difference that I identified is not the problem. So I will show you, so this is the email alias list that, this is the email that is currently working the way that we want it to work. Okay. Got it. So the mail. Okay. You know, here's all of that information. And I have, let me, so I will go ahead and log in as me to PC Recruiter. And you can see what... Okay. Oh, I felt so clever seeing that difference. Darn it. Okay. No, sorry. So then basically you see this her...
