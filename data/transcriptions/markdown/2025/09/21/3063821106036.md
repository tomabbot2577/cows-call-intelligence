## 💬 Full Transcript

 Scott Hewitt. Hey, Scott. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. Hey, Jim. Hey, how are you? I was about to call you. I happened to glance down and realized I had missed it by a couple of minutes, so I apologize for being a few minutes late. No, you're good. I couldn't remember where we – I was just looking at my email to see if I was supposed to call you or you were supposed to call me. So, no problem. I was just finishing up with the IT department on the setup exchange and different things I need for a new job. So let's go for it, PC Recruiter. Excellent. Yeah. So I just want to kind of see what you're doing. So you are kind of rolling into the KBIC family, kind of rolling everything into them. Yeah. I work with people that do that. You're the third one in the last month or two. Really? And let's see. So I still have you as a current paid open PC Recruiter account. So I was confused by that. So I wanted to kind of see what was happening there and see what data you wanted to transfer or what. Okay. So I wasn't aware that we were still paying for it, I think. So my dad was the one that was in charge of the finances. He passed away in April. So we are still up to date on our payments, or where are we? I have no idea. Well, what it likely was, as I was looking, it looks like you all paid annually. So it may have been an annual invoice that was paid like last November. I don't know when, but that would mean it was paid for the period. Let's see if I have any activities to that. I don't, but I'll check and see. I'll check and see when it was paid. Okay, no problem. Yeah, because it's current and it's active. So I was able to access. I can't get in because I don't have a password, but the link is up. So I didn't know if you thought it might make more sense for us just to take the data that's in PC Recruiter right now and just move that because it's quicker than doing a data conversion from the – I think you went to LOXO, did you? Yeah. Okay. Or if you have added a lot since you went to LOXO, when did you leave? Five months ago. So, you know, we – let's see. We – yeah, it would have been February. So February, March, April, May, June, July. Yeah, so six months basically. But I was wondering if there was a way to just convert a few of those, a few of the candidates and sources that I have in there and put them on a file or something and then put it in with the old data from PC Recruiter. Well, easiest thing to do. So we could either convert the whole LOXO database or move the whole PC Recruiter database over. But if we move the PC Recruiter database, obviously that's not going to include anything that happened in the last six months. So probably, since you've been using the LOXO, we would most want to convert the LOXO database, which we can do here. KBIC covers the tab for that, and they would just need to get a data backup from LOXO, get it over to our conversion team here, and then they could do that data conversion. it's tricky to try and merge or share data or anything like that so we don't really want to try and take like just just the new data and merge it with the existing old pc recruiter data or anything like that so we'd want to do either one or the other and i would presume it sounds like you'd want the data that you put in the last six months so we probably want to just convert the lock so yeah i know how much of a pain in the butt that is uh but i actually felt like a lot of stuff that got converted over from PC Recruiter isn't that valuable because it was, I don't know, it came in a different format. And I think about Luxo, it was very strange. You couldn't, when you put in like a phone number, let's say, you would have to just come in as one number, basically, and you'd have to like space it out and redo it, reformat it. And then you'd also, a lot of the stuff that came in, came in under the same company name and it wasn't right. So it was, I don't know, maybe it would just be better for us just to do a piece of Recruiter, move that stuff over. I know that stuff is accurate. And then I guess I can take some of my stuff, can I put it into, like, Word or just the way to copy and paste it into Excel maybe? You could do something like that. You could do something like that. So what we could do is we could move, just basically pluck the database off of the Huey, enterprises link push put it over to kbic then that would all be there uh then you i don't know if you can work with locks with to get data out of into like a csv because you could map a csv into that database there's no cost to do it you could do it with the guidance i know brian knows how to do it but the crew at kbic knows how to do it um so you could map that in you could even update existing records but that's only going to be field data it won't be any like activities or or anything like that. It'll be primarily field data, if that might work. Okay. Hmm. Oh, man. I don't know. How long do you think it would take to do Luxo? They've been running about...
