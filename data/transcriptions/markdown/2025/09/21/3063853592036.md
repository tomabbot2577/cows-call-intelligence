## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. My name is Tom Henderson. I work with the Marine Group, and I have a recruiter that's having issues parsing a resume or opening any attachments that are anything under the attachments tab. I wasn't sure if it was that bug where you have to clear out the cache and everything. I did suggest she do that. It didn't seem to help. She hasn't been able to do that in the past, so it might be that it's just not sure what product to use to open it. Gotcha. So specifically for opening attachments and using the parsing tool, you'll need Java and PCR Launcher installed on the computer. Those two programs kind of work in the background to make those exact functions work. So I can email you a link to install both of those, and you just basically have the user click the link, download it on their computer, and then open each of those two files to run the installer, which is just like hitting next a few times. Yeah, I mean, I usually have done the installer. I didn't know about the Java. Usually doesn't that load all when you first launch up PC Recruiter? I mean, doesn't it automatically load the launcher? No, you'll have to install the launcher first. But when you have it installed, probably the first time you log in, it'll say, do you want to open the launcher? And you would just check the box that says always allow so that you don't get bothered with that question over and over. But yeah, let me email you the links to download those two. um all right let me um oh yeah go ahead and send it to me and then i'll forward it to her just so it's always okay to have it yeah also all right i have tom at shepherd sg.com is that the best email yes perfect okay i will send that over now and then if you do get stuck on any steps or the user does uh just let us know okay um is there a way in case it's not working and she needs to give you guys a call to walk through it on her computer. Because like I've done, I log in on my side and I don't have a problem. But again, I'm not on her computer, so I don't know what's loaded. Is there a number that I can give for you so that you know what's going on? No, yeah, just call the support line. And you could even ask for me. My name's Garrett. you could just say we had an issue previously and just kind of talk to Garrett. That's totally fine. Okay. Okay. I will do that. I appreciate all the help. No problem. Look out for an email from me soon and reach out if you need anything else. All right. Thank you again....
