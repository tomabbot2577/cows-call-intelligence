## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. Happy to help you. Hey Tyler, it's Jeanette from Job.com. How are you? Good. How are you? Doing pretty good. Just had a quick question about timesheets. Yes. So we just started using timesheets in PCR and we're getting ready to email out all our new people because we're switching over from another ATS. Yes. And a question came up. So we know we send them the email, they download the app, then they don't open it, then they activate the account, then they can open the app and do it on their phone, right? So we were like, what if a person can't do it on their phone or they don't have a phone? And then I saw there's a web portal, right? But the web portal means you already have to have activated it on your phone to get a username and password. Is that right? So it should – let me pop open the web portal on my end here. Because I was wondering if they got the email, if they tried to activate it without downloading the app, would they then get a username and password there? I haven't tested it, to put in the web portal. I know somebody's going to have this issue. Yeah, let me take a look here. I can actually test it right now on the phone with you. Thank you. One second here, I just re-sent myself the email and I'm going to open it up on the web here. Okay. Because when I look at that email and when I tried to do it, because I thought that was the way around it, it says once you've downloaded the mobile app and created a password, then you can use the timesheet web portal. if they don't have password they can't get in and then I also tried just clicking just now the activate account without downloading it and then it says download the app yeah I'm getting the same thing Yeah, let me see here. Give me two seconds so Just testing something here to see if there's another way in. Okay. That might be why. because there is like you can give them the link to the web portal I'm just trying to see if put just putting in their email and password but they wouldn't have gotten the power yet because putting in there putting in their email and saying forgot password what's oh okay okay great great so giving that a try right now so that does work so okay thank you is send them the link to the web portal and then they could just put in they could just hit the forgot password and they'll put in their email address and their last name and it'll send them a link to reset their password okay oh does it ask for last name too I haven't yes okay Yes, let me just try it with an email address that hasn't already registered before. So just crossing T's and dot and I's here real quick. Oh, definitely, yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and do that. All right, so we'll send the invite. Now if we go to the contractor. password Thank you. I'm sorry. Yep. Oh, great. So let me... All right, thank you for testing that. Yeah, let me just make sure it works after I reset the password. Yep. So the way you get that link to is you'll go to the system menu in PC Recruiter. Oh, I have it from the email too. But yeah, if you want to tell me where it is there too, that'd be great. So go to system and then you'll scroll about halfway down. You'll see where it says web extension classic. Okay. Yep. And then in there, you'll see where it says PCR website links. Okay. And then you'll see two contractor hour collection. It'll be the second one down. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. This helps a ton because I know it's going to happen, so it's perfect. Yep. So yeah, if that does happen, just give them that website. Tell them to hit forgot password and enter their email and last name, and it'll send them an email to reset their password so that way they can log in. Wonderful. Thank you so much. That's just what I needed. Yep. More than happy to help. Great. Have a good rest of the day. You as well. Thank you. Bye-bye....
