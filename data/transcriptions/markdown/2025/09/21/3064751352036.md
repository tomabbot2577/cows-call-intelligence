## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Tina from the room. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. It's been a while. I know. What have you been up to? Just working my butt off. How about you? Oh, pretty good. Let's see. What's going on? What do you need help with? I have a contact, like a company contact in the system that is set to manager, well, hiring authority. I tried manager too. Okay. But it can't get into the portal. It just says that the username is wrong or the password is wrong. Okay. Let me see what it could be. Let me know when you're ready for the name. let me get to your database is this in the recruiting emotion database i assume yep yeah the usa one's gone now okay now they're trying to go to the employer portal is that what they're trying to use okay Okay. What is the person's name? So the name is Yvonne, Y-V-O-N-N-E. Okay. Last name, Azaglo, A-Z-A-G-L-O. Oh, you know what? I'm realizing she has two emails. Yeah, so she's going to have to use the one that's in the primary email field, the Gmail address. Is that the one she's trying to use? I'm assuming she's trying to use her work one. Okay, so what you might have to do is flip that. Yeah. Under record. Let's do that. Okay. Okay. So I just did that. Let me just test it. Yeah. Any kind of field other than the predefined email address is considered custom and it wouldn't be used for anything else. So it's got to be whatever's in that primary email field. Perfect. Yeah, that worked. Awesome. Thank you so much. Oh, no problem. Have a good week. You too. Bye-bye. Alrighty. Thanks. Bye....
