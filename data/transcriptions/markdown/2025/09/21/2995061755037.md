## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett, and I hope you... Hey, Garrett, good morning. I just have a question. I know there's a way to do this. I just haven't figured it out, but I need... I want to just kind of make a global change where I can select what activities are actually visible in each record when I pull it up instead of seeing all the system and logging all the stuff. You know, there's only certain ones that I want to see. Is there a way to make that change? Yeah, absolutely. So if you go to any name record and then go to the activities tab, you'll be able to see at the top right in the action menu. You'll probably have to click the three horizontal lines. There's a default filters option. This will be a gear icon in the action menu. and that'll open up a pop-up window where you can take the activity types from the left and add them to the selected items on the right by clicking the plus sign next to each one. There's a user up above. There's like a user filter as well, but it sounds like you just want to adjust the activities type filter down below. Yeah, exactly. Okay. All right. Got that. All right. Perfect. That's all I needed. All right. We'll reach out if you need anything else. That makes that change globally, right? Not just for that record? For all your records, but it's only for your username that you'll have this filter applied. It's not global to all users, but it is global to all your name records for your username. Because on the right at the top under selected items, it says zero. So should I add my username over there then? No. for any time you have the selected items blank it'll show all the available options so you'll be able to see activities by any user if you leave that blank okay but what if I put my name over there does that make any did it that'll hide any activities created by any other user okay so if the right the top right is blank it says zero selected items that's that's fine right that's good yeah that's the recommended setting for that all right perfect all right awesome that's all I need to know my other question for you too is and I don't know if you make a recommendation or not but I'm looking to maybe just grab a new phone over the next few months one that I can because right now I do all my calls from my cell phone and the ring central app on there but I'm I'm wondering if there's like a desk phone that's still voice over IP that I can plug into my computer that works directly with, you know, PC Recruiter. Oh, so yeah, our only integration is with RingCentral. So if they have, maybe if RingCentral has a certain model of phone that they recommend, but most would probably work desktop phone. Okay. Yeah, as long as it can connect to RingCentral, you'll be good. Okay. All right. Gotcha. All right. So when I'm ready then, so you're saying just maybe best to reach out to them? Yeah, or if maybe they even have a recommendation on their website somewhere for a good desktop phone. But yeah, as long as it can connect to your computer and talk to the RingCentral account you have, then you should be in good shape. All right. Awesome. Sounds good. All right. Thanks so much for your help, Garrett. I appreciate it. All right. Have a good one. All right. You too. Bye-bye....
