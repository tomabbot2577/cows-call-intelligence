I just got your email back. one thing I wanted to tell you and I didn't want to do it over email is I do see that you have two cards stored and I don't even know if like maybe the other one is one that you want to use so I figured it'd be easier for me if you want to turn off out of page delete any cards and then wait that way you can basically like reset it up but we can do that over the phone it might be easier that way give me a call when you have a moment 440-946-5214 and I'm at extension Thank you.
