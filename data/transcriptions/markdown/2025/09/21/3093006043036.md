## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Tyler, what's up? Hey, is there a serial code for candidate match? Yeah, it's AI embeddings. Ah, that's why I wasn't seeing it. Yeah. Are you meaning in your database? Yeah. Yeah. So when you do that, you have to run a reindex after you add it because it needs to go through and embed all of the resumes, I think is the only thing that it does. Because that's how the AI, whatever, that's how the AI candidate match can work. That's why if you go onto Trunk, the, like, test one or whatever database, that one will bring back your record for every match. Oh, because it's not indexed? Yeah, because yours was added after the serial code was. How am I going to test this, then? Is it in what database? I don't have it in it. The only one I could test it in is Garrett's, then. Oh, okay. I think I had it. Yeah, because I can't re-index databases either, by the way. You can't re-index what? Databases. Why? I don't have access to the Lucene servers. Oh. Or those other two servers that cover some cancellations in the downloads. So I can literally put people on new pipeline right now. which I know I know I'm preaching to the choir but like what's the point of bringing out another tech if you're not going to give me fucking access to be able to help Mackenzie do anything that's how you can make my day better my job easier Nick fucking access I need but here's the thing Garberstone's told me twice that you already had access so I don't know Mac has been having issues with it too, though. So I'm wondering if there's something else going on because... Where the fuck is this? What am I looking for? Yeah, I go to mine. I have the shortcuts for it on my desktop, on .10. And then it just yells at me that I don't have access to cancellations. or when I try and log into downloads, it tells me no. And like re-indexing, so you can't even get to the, like can you get to the database creator? Yeah, I can press the up to Lucene button, but then it never goes up to Lucene because whatever PowerShell that runs requires access to the Lucene servers. Uh-oh, oh, there's my key in there. Hmm. Good. Do you know what server your database is on, by chance? Well, would Mew2 be a different one? I don't know. I don't know if those are different servers or not. let's see oh you're aren't you isn't it T problem is that not yeah yep Oh, there we go. Hmm. There's two of these here. You have this one and this one is new. Yeah, I don't know what that new one is. Okay. So do you have GDPR legacy pipeline? Yep. Your 10 sequencing? Okay. What database do you want it in? I do the PCR 10. Do I have to put the new dashboard? All right. That'll do it for new too. Index for that too, right? Yeah, it should. because... I'm not making it three. There we go. Oh. Yeah, it should. Let me put that code in. You said it's AI embed? Like E-M-B-E-D-I-N-G-S, I think? Embeddings? Let me... You know what? I'm not going to do that. I'm going to copy it out of my thing instead because I... I spell it like a third grade level. You're all right. I have to visually see it. Otherwise... Oh, I already had it in there. You did? Oh, okay, cool. You're not on nine. Oh, no. TCR 10. It is on nine. Yeah, let me try it in here. Yeah. If it works for one of these positions. Hey, there we go. I got it. I thought I had Matt go through and add that for everybody. And I think that's the one that you sent me. So cool. All right. We don't have to do that. OK. And then there is. That's good enough for me. Yeah. But when you go through and do it, there is an icon. I think that's probably still. Oh, no. I needed an oopsie, and I needed them to... Do we have that stupid import issue with Truett? Oh, yeah. So I asked them to... I was like, oh, can you index... Or can you restore the database to my thing? I sent them the... I sent them the database ID for the test database I normally use so that it got overwritten instead of into a new database. Which is fine, I got the check back, but I was like, oh, why did I do that? Sample position, okay, I guess so. Yeah, so when you go through, when you do look at that, the icon is super teeny tiny. There's already a bug to get to that. Does that AI candidate match me? Yeah, when you pin the icon, it's like super teeny tiny at first until you like reload. which I have no idea why it was like that but oh interesting oh yeah yeah oh interesting but okay I think it's up thank you and then of the rest up tomorrow I've kind of just been keeping a notepad going through each one I think that all of these, yeah literally everywhere opens. And the company. And then, and then. Oh I forgot to set this up. I wish they would make the description summary at the top resizable. And I think, can we have this next? Oh, okay, clicking on those does not do anything. Good. Oh, the Roll of Bliss tokens, right? Let me just... Oh, cool. That's all I had. I'm going to hop off because I have that import call in five minutes. but let me know if you run into anything else with that, ok...
