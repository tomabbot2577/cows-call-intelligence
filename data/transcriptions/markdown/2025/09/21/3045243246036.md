## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Robin. It's Deb Oaks from Royal Bridge. How are you? I'm good. How are you doing? Good. Are you aware of any issues that are happening between LinkedIn and your capture tool this morning? We had like a URL that was yesterday morning, but that was fixed. What are you experiencing today? Well, all of a sudden, everyone in my office, their capture tool got toggled to capture default company. And then Pete brought a couple people in this morning, or actually yesterday afternoon, he brought some people in. and their LinkedIn profile is in their attachments, but the LinkedIn URL is not on their page. Is that what happened yesterday? Yeah, what it was for some reason, I don't know what they did, but instead of saying it's social underscore LinkedIn, which is where we always stored it, it was like social underscore LinkedIn recruiter. It's an easy fix. I can fix that. But I don't know why it would automatically have captured a default company turned on because I'm looking at mine. I don't know. I know there was an update that went through yesterday and all of a sudden, you know, Pete sent me a message this morning. He goes, I don't know why, but I just realized that the last five people I've put into Mesero are all in candidates. And I don't know why that happened. I never toggled it back. And I went into my LinkedIn today and saw, Yes, it's showing that it was, you know, and when I switch databases, it does the same thing. I have to do it for every database. I have to move that slider. I don't know what would cause that because I'm looking at mine, and it's only connected to one database. You would have to log out, log in. But mine is still, like, set where it would go to the company. let me I'm going to log out and try going to Boise and see what comes up because that's the only one that I haven't accessed today I've already fixed it on the main and the Warbridge one let's see what it does that one's fine It's just so weird. Yeah, I haven't heard of that one. I don't know. I mean, that one is okay. It's just, but yeah, I'm both on me. The one yesterday was a URL. They both were slid over, and I've never had it set up that way. Yeah, that's kind of weird. I haven't noticed that, and I haven't heard of anybody where that was happening to. What database were you importing to yesterday or using capture for yesterday? She was putting it in the main database. Main, okay let me see. Yeah and it was it was P ransom that did it. Okay let me see how many records have that different URL. Let's see different field names. And there's probably only three of them, unless he puts them in other positions that I'm not aware of. Okay, let me just do that. But there's three that I haven't gone and fixed yet. And after a second, I'm like going, okay, why is the LinkedIn address not there? Because I figured I could just go to it, click on their LinkedIn URL and update their company. And it's not there. I'm like, that's weird. But yet when I go into attachments, it shows that he was brought in from LinkedIn. You know, I mean, there are pictures there from LinkedIn. you know and so I have to go into their attachments and open their profile in order to get to their LinkedIn profile okay let's see there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten okay answered some for other okay well this is just 10 in the database could be anybody and the other days I'm just looking at who has now here's the thing where they update or just do these one by one I think it's safer to do that I mean I've been going around doubling up so let me see yeah because what I've been doing is I've been going and then I've been just going and doing a click to update from their LinkedIn profile and then it puts it in it I think of it I didn't even notice if they added that and I did why Frank's waiting or this one the other one that I did at Slavia noon she's another one that I did but it actually she came in and then I did Gregory Brodeur. Okay. Those three this morning. Show off field. Okay, I'm going to move this to the regular one. Okay. Pam West is fixed. Next one here I'll tell you where you can kind of see not that you really care Dallas Faye is that the first name I guess so Dallas Faye Geraldo that could be because we have somebody in our company his name is Dallas Downey so and he's no relation to Jack either okay oh it's switched okay on their profile they must have it switched okay if you go to the name first name is gerald and last name is dallas a d-a-l-i-s-a-y D-A-L-I-S-A-Y. D-A-L-I-S-A-Y. Oh, I. He's in Houston, Texas. Okay. Yeah, John Fisher brought him in. Okay. So if you are on his name record, on the same toolbar we have like resume, activities, there's that three-lined icon. Click on that and select details, which is kind of like where all the custom fields are.
