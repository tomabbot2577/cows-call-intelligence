## 💬 Full Transcript

**[0:01] Speaker_00:** Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology.

**[0:04] Speaker_00:** This is Garrett.

**[0:05] Speaker_00:** How may I help you?

**[0:07] Speaker_03:** Hi, Garrett.

**[0:08] Speaker_03:** Actually, as a matter of fact, I believe it was you who had given me a call back earlier this morning.

**[0:13] Speaker_03:** I had left a voicemail yesterday regarding a couple of questions I had had.

**[0:17] Speaker_02:** So I wanted to follow up on some of those.

**[0:21] Speaker_02:** Sorry, excuse me.

**[0:23] Speaker_02:** I was expecting to be on hold a little bit longer, so I am still pulling up these notes here, if you'll bear with me.

**[0:28] Speaker_00:** Not a problem.

**[0:50] Speaker_03:** Okay, so the main thing that I wanted to ask about, I had seen, I can't remember where I thought initially, but then I had seen also a link on a PCR website that mentioned something about tags or tagging and that it's separate from custom fields.

**[1:09] Speaker_03:** I'd actually asked my PCR administrator about that.

**[1:12] Speaker_03:** He's like, yeah, I'm not sure about that.

**[1:15] Speaker_03:** He even said, you know, it doesn't sound much different than custom fields.

**[1:20] Speaker_03:** So I wanted to one kind of call and, you know, potentially learn a little bit more about that either from you or if you guys have like some sort of training or video somewhere that I can go consume in that regard and kind of how it's different from custom fields if it is and then to how to get it enabled and start utilizing it.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** Yeah, absolutely.

**[1:42] Speaker_00:** So custom fields are more of you just want to store data on the edit name tab.

**[1:51] Speaker_00:** When you're looking at a record, you have the edit name tab where you have all those various fields.

**[1:56] Speaker_00:** So that all lives there.

**[1:58] Speaker_00:** You could create a custom field and store special data that's not already in PCR.

**[2:04] Speaker_00:** On the other hand, we have another tab on the name record called keywords.

**[2:10] Speaker_00:** Sometimes these are called tags in other softwares.

**[2:13] Speaker_00:** We just call it keywords.

**[2:14] Speaker_00:** And basically, you can add in keywords to make names more searchable later on.

**[2:21] Speaker_00:** not just names you can do this on company records as well position records yeah but so basically you just add in some keywords and then when you're using the keywords box in the basic search or even the advanced search you could enter that keyword and anyone who you've saved the keyword to under the keywords tab will come up as a search result that that is kind of the first layer of keywords, you can just type them in there, add keywords, however you want there.

**[2:57] Speaker_00:** This next layer would be to create a uniform list of keywords in the system settings so that anyone on your team can choose from that list when adding keywords.

**[3:10] Speaker_00:** So things are more uniform across the team.

**[3:14] Speaker_00:** Okay.

**[3:16] Speaker_03:** And that was one of the questions I had as well.

**[3:18] Speaker_03:** So essentially, the idea that I'd had was kind of creating a master list or roll-up within PCR for just basically anybody that had been meaningfully engaged with in the past to kind of re-reference and segment away from, kind of having separate from, okay, these are people that we've never called before or that we've attempted but weren't managed to reach versus like, hey, anywhere from, hey, we sent this person on a send out to, hey, I just talked to this guy for, you know, 10 minutes and talked shop with him, kind of putting that in a list and then being able to tag or keyword it based off of that activity like, hey, this person is referral given keyword or this person is conversation head keyword, et cetera, et cetera.

**[4:12] Speaker_03:** So I'd seen something about saved searches as well, being able to search by roll-up and then being able to go and essentially say, okay, who has this tag or keyword that hasn't been contacted in the last 45 days?

**[4:26] Speaker_03:** I think you can do a custom field for date of last contact.

**[4:30] Speaker_03:** It's kind of hooked up to that activities tab as well.

**[4:32] Speaker_03:** So that was kind of the macro idea.

**[4:36] Speaker_03:** So I was trying to learn a little bit more about both tags and optimizing the custom fields in order to make that happen, essentially.

**[4:45] Speaker_03:** Yeah.

**[4:46] Speaker_00:** So, yeah, what you're speaking of right at the end there was the last activity.

**[4:52] Speaker_00:** That is a field that's already in PCR.

**[4:54] Speaker_00:** It's called the last activity, and it'll record a date of their last activity.

**[4:59] Speaker_00:** So you could do a search, either basic search or advanced search, and say, show me everybody with the last activity greater than this date or less than this date or something like that.

**[5:14] Speaker_00:** and then yeah so so you can based on what you just said you can add those specific keywords into a list in the system settings that you were mentioning about frequency of contact or that you've had a conversation with them then you can start applying those two records in their keywords tab and saving that there.

**[5:40] Speaker_00:** And then you would build a search that says anybody that has these keywords and has a last activity date of this date or further, any other criteria you want to add in there.

**[5:56] Speaker_00:** This is probably going to be an advanced search.

**[5:59] Speaker_00:** But yeah, and then you can save that search so that when you pull up advanced search next time around, you don't have to rebuild all those criteria in.

**[6:10] Speaker_00:** You can just open one of your saved searches.

**[6:13] Speaker_00:** Right.

**[6:14] Speaker_03:** Kind of build a table of contents, if you will, of specific searches that you'd like to come back to.

**[6:19] Speaker_03:** Right.

**[6:21] Speaker_00:** Exactly.

**[6:22] Speaker_00:** There's also the option of, you know, when you're in that advanced search area, there's a heading at the bottom called query and if you expand it you'll see that as you add in criteria to your advanced search it generates a code or a query at the bottom you can actually copy this code and paste it into your my pcr dashboard so that when you first log in you're usually seeing in the bottom frame the my pcr dashboard you can always get to it by going to my pcr in the main menu but you can add a just a one-click button to run that search that you've copied the code for and so it's just sitting right there on your on your dashboard anytime you adjust your dashboard it is user specific so you can have different searches on your dashboard than someone else on the team but there are there's always ways to just copy certain settings from user to user and the MyPCR dashboard is included in that.
