## 💬 Full Transcript

 Gary, you there? Okay, there we go. My headphones fell asleep. What's up? So you were able to recreate the issue? Yeah, with that user, yep. It's just looking like... Because the database's international settings are set a little bit different than that user's. The weird thing is the J-E-N-S, maybe Jens, whatever, their username matches the faulty username's international settings and time zone settings. and the JENS user can make the placements. So they're going to what, the company or the position? Position record, clicking on placements tab, and then going add permanent placement in the action menu. Now is it for all positions or just this one? All of them. I think I've tried a handful. Yeah, I tried a handful. God bless you. God bless you twice. So they're negative six. Oh. Did they copy the settings from someone? Oh, like their user setting? I'm not sure, actually. Would we have that in the user logs or something that they copy? Oh, I see it. Hold on. Okay. Thank you. Do they have a position where the placement's been made before? By this particular person or by anybody? By anybody. Yeah, let me see here. Oh, wait. Let's do this. Yeah, so position number 961, GTE Ventas. It looks like a user named Susanna made some placements on this one. Thank you. So, once you get to the edit placement screen. Okay. I didn't even look at that part. So, yeah, I can edit. It's looking like... Oh, no. Okay. Never mind. Yeah, I'm not sure on that one. It's a little strange. Just that one user so far has reported it. Okay. Maybe ask Mac if, like, removing the user and then putting them back in. Oh, okay. Might do something. yeah I'll add that to the note I tagged Mac in it it's a good suggestion at least a starting place there yeah alright that's all I had cool well thanks for taking a look yeah no problem see ya...
