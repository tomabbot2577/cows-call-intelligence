## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. Robin, this is Farah DePasquale from Management Recruiters. We got like an invoice that paid and I think we were billed for four seats and we have been only using one. Okay I'd have to see if there was a we do not go based on what the usernames are in the database because sometimes they're test users so we have to be notified when you were from before we have been okay you want feet and then all of a sudden ah we paid okay I said why don't they change okay so I believe there was a consultant going in and doing some like review for taxes like making sure people were paying taxes and it's possible they went to an old invoice and then updated the template what is the company name how do we have it listed on the invoice it's management recruiters of I think it was named under management recruiters of Somerville so mm er vi le right mr Somerville but it's under management it should be how is it listed on the invoice because that's how you have to look up the company let me just see this bluestone advisors for certain advisors okay okay the previous Robin it was only one oh yeah your old invoices used to be that okay no that's the new yeah right yeah they used to be change that is probably yeah they probably actually updated replaced your recurring looking at an older invoice okay so let me see how do we want to do this and it's already paid okay so do you want that refunded or do you want to just skip you or do you just want to skip the next nobody what do they charge it will be more confusing we just want the difference here refunded okay so what i'll have to do is i'll have to go to our bookkeeper i don't have the access to do any kind of refunds so i will reach out to her now back to the card like that like yeah she'll have to yeah that's not anything i can do but i can reach out to her to have it done in the meantime what i'm going to do is i'm going to fix your recurring template it which is basically i thought that was what was it it was yes it was some reason probably it reverted back to the old one yeah i have an old system or changing a system something okay so what was happening is we have like a consulting like a book company company and they're going in and applying the tax rate whether it's out of state chicago's got or like people in illinois they have some weird ones so they were going through and doing that and I think what they did is they went into a previous invoice and adjusted it to be out of state and then they overrode the template but they overrode the with the amount there was a couple customers where that happened too so I know it's not completely a surprise you're not the first one but I'm going to have that fixed and I'll have that difference refunded so let me see it was not there anymore no no we have a team still there yes okay yeah so okay so the amount you charge was 208 60 and it should have been 52 12 so the difference that we need to refund back is 156 48 okay so I will reach out and I will have that done and then let me pull up your information Okay, this is for Erin. And you're Farah DePasquale. Is SD at MRI Bluestone still the correct email for you? That's correct. Okay. Can you confirm that in the email, Robin, that this is what we discussed? I'm actually going to make a ticket instead. way I have more tracking on it if I do it as a ticket so I'm going to do that for you right now but I'm also going to reach out to our new book keep our bookkeeper company and have them send that back to you. You will CC me on that? I'm gonna make it with your name I'm gonna make it with your name okay so yeah you'll get it and as soon as I have confirmation that it's done I'm gonna reply in the ticket and then close that out for you okay perfect and what happens here you will just refund is the difference of 156. yeah one yeah 156.48 48 okay and going forward we should not be charged for that yes i've already i went in i am able to adjust your next invoice and i have that back to 52 15. okay because like the only um user there should be a william samba yeah So, yeah, whenever your user account changes, you have to let us know, which you did at one point. It's just they overwrote the template. So I just have to – I fixed it. Yeah. Okay. So I fixed it. I adjusted the users for your next invoice scheduled for August 17th. What I can't do is the refund, so that's what I need somebody else to do. Okay. And then I will be CC'd in the email or whatever. I'll get something in the email. You are the best, Robin. Oh, thank you, everyone. 156.48. Okay. So let's see. I'll put in a little details just the way it works. I'm trying to see if I get it. Because if I keep relying just on emails, as you know, emails are overlooked when I get lots of emails every day. So by making a ticket, I know at some point I've got to close it out to make sure it's done. Okay. So I'm creating a ticket now. Perfect. As long as it gets corrected going forward....
