## 💬 Full Transcript

 Oh, hi there. Good afternoon. This is Ben. I'm calling from RingCentral. I'm trying to actually get in touch with the person in charge who handles your RingCentral phone system for main sequence technology. I'm not really sure who that would be, like in what aspect. That's okay. This is something to do with the entire account. We're doing an account review. Yeah, that's okay. Let me see if I can because I'm actually seeing several contacts here. Yeah, I'd probably reach out. We would not be handling that here in support though. Okay, got it. No worries. Well, thank you for taking my call. I'll try again. Okay, take care. Okay, bye-bye....
