## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Matt. Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I got your email. You're having trouble with the activities? Yeah, hey, Garrett. I really appreciate the call. I probably should know how to do this already, but I don't know. It's just whatever button, I can't find it, so it's eluding me, and it's a pretty simple problem. No worries. So here's what I got going on here. One of my coworkers, David, brought this up to me. So when you do an action or when you click on a stage to change it, they have – let me look in my activities here. Where is my – so in the activities screen, when you do like a search of, let's say, a person's activities for the day, one of the headers is ACT type, activity type, slash result. And underneath that, like when we change it to stage three, it says stage three. You know, and likewise for like stage one, it says stage one. But if I change it to stage seven or another stage, it just says activity. And I cannot, for the life of me, find where I could redefine what happens when I change it, like, to stage seven. And I want that to come up in my activity search screen as stage seven under activity type. Okay. So in the result column, you mean, when you're on the activities tab of a name record? Well, yeah, like when you click on, you know, you can search the activities for somebody for the day, right? Oh, yeah, if you're going to activities up in the main menu. Yeah, in the main menu, yeah. David just brought up because, you know, we got to count like sometimes what we do and this and that and whatnot. And it's just easier, like, to count it through if it'll just say, you know, stage seven, you know, under activity type, you know, in that column. But it doesn't. And I must have set it up wrong originally. And so I just want to change it. And I don't know where that is. I've been through, like I thought, like every scenario in the system settings, and I just can't find it. Okay. Yeah, I'm seeing. Okay, so it's writing activity. Interesting. Activity is a custom. Here, let's do this. I'm going to take a look at your custom activities you've created in your database. It seems like the activity type called activity is a custom one that's been added to your database. that's not one that's normally available. Let's see. Oh, okay. There we go. Hmm. Okay. This doesn't have any results with it. Closed seven, stage seven. Hmm. Okay. So I'm going to pull up a roll-up list and see. Or if you could call, like, who are you logged in under? I think I'm under your username, MK. Okay. Let's see here. I'd rather you look up activities, you know, as opposed to a roll-up. Are these activities being generated as you change somebody from one roll-up stage to another roll-up stage? Yes. Yes. OK, I think that's where the configuration is set up incorrectly in the roll up stage configuration. The roll up stage can be set to automatically write a specific activity. And so if you're moving somebody to, like, say, stage seven and it's not set to automatically write the stage seven activity, that's where the disconnect will happen. And so I think it's in that stage setup. And I'll just go. So when you say stage setup, you're in probably database setup? Yeah. So there's some rollups that are set up using global rollup stages. And it looks like, yeah, it looks like your database requires the global rollup stages. So that actually narrows it down. So if we go to System in the main menu and then go to Database Setup on the left, just like you said, Database Setup, and Roll-Up List Global Stage Setup on the right. Yeah. Oh, that's on the left on mine. Let me – hold on. Maybe I'm – hold on. Global List – Roll-Up List Global Stage Setup, right? Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, your computer is just – your monitor is – yeah, it's on the left for me. but that's okay oh gotcha um so once that yeah i went there yeah um you'll see the various stages there and what they're called in the description field directly to the right and then in the field directly to the or the column directly to the right of that it says default activity type at the top of that column this is the activity that will be written when somebody's moved to this stage. So let's see. So for example, there is one for stage seven and it is writing the activity for stage seven. If they're moved to stage zero, it's just writing the word activity rather than, okay. And the same with closed. Yes. And same with clear, just write the activity one. Okay. Yeah, that just doesn't seem to be right, though. Could you re-log in to David's thing? Sure. Or is it too... No, yeah, I could try that. Let me look at David Lopez DL. Yeah. Since these are global stages, I think they'll look the exact same. Yeah, they should be. But he just had more stuff today. So I actually have both of ours pulled up into the same thing. but perfect. Yeah. Okay. So I just researched it just so it kind of probably matches. So like if you look under, once you just do a, just a general ...
