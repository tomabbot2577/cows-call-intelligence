 Hi, and thank you for calling the all-new Ken Ganley Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, mentor formerly Painesville. Please listen carefully to the options below. Please press 1 for sales, 2 for service, 3 for parts, 4 for our hours of operation. Ken Ganley Chrysler Service, how can I help you? Hey I wanted to see about getting a service appointment. All righty have you been here before? Oh yeah. Okay. There are different phone numbers that might be under? Oh yeah has nothing to do with the number I'm calling from. It would be under 440-339-9107. Alrighty, I see this on that Pacifica or the Wrangler? The Pacifica. Gotcha. What are you looking to get done? Well, our air conditioning has broken and it broke last summer, then over the winter it miraculously worked again and it worked all summer until last week and now it broke again. We had our mechanic take a look, he couldn't find a leak anywhere, he recharged it, there's a leak somewhere that is yet to be found. So we need to have a look at it and it needs an oil change too. Okay. So it is just blowing hot, correct? It's not blowing air at all? It still blows. It just blows hot air. Perfect. Perfect. Did you want your tires rotated as well with that oil change? If they haven't been done in a while, but I don't really notice it. Okay. So maybe, if they desperately need it. gotcha alrighty so my soonest availability would be Wednesday the 30th I have 1.30 and 2pm left that day okay well my question would be can I leave it all week with you next week is that a thing because I'm not in town next week I could drop it today or tomorrow and then leave it there all week or it'll have to be when I come back after August 4th which it would be ideal to leave it there most likely they wouldn't start until the Wednesday just since that's what I'm going to book it for but I can let them know that you're going to leave the vehicle with us it'll probably just sit here Monday and Tuesday that's really all that is even better because we're going to be out of town and we won't need it so that we won't be missing a vehicle because we wouldn't need it anyway so let us drop it off today or tomorrow and now let's book it for the 30th at 1pm gotcha and then we will be back to get it on monday the 4th if that's all right i would imagine it's gonna take a day or two to get everything done yeah it'll probably take about a day or two um let's see here all right i have noted that and i will let my service advisors know that you're gonna leave the vehicle with us uh here for about a week yeah that would just since we're not in town we don't need it and if i didn't think you all charged like storage fees because i wanted to clear it ahead of time that you could we could keep it there just work on it on wednesday and keep it all week and then we'll get it when we come back yeah i i do i will just clear with my service advisors um unless they say something different which i don't see why you wouldn't be able to do that um i will give you a call back if they say something but i'm going to shoot it out to my service advisors um and if you don't hear back from me just assume you're all good because i have a feeling they should be fine with that perfect perfect time well then we'll be by later this afternoon or early evening to drop it off how late are you there uh we are there until 6 p.m tonight all right awesome thank you very much all right you're welcome you have a good one bye...
