## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Tyler. How can I help you? Hey, Tyler. It's Heather calling from Harbinger. How are you doing? Good. How are you, Heather? Great. Thank you. I've had a few people message me or call me to say that PCR is pretty slow today. Is there anything going on in the background that you're aware of? Not that I'm aware of. We haven't had any other reports of it. Do you know which, are they in the Harbinger network database? Two people are in the Harbinger Network database, and I think one is in the sales database. All right, let me pop in and take a look. I haven't been in the system very much today, so I haven't experienced it, but I haven't done much. Do you know which users? S. Davies and C. Hamer in the Harbinger Network database, and then J. Ruecker in the sales database. all right let me take a look here I'm just walking in with those users to take a look around yeah everything's working really fast on my end here are these people like what do they say like specifically what parts they were doing that were running slow? Oh, you know what? Jocelyn was in the main database. She was in the positions, in some of her positions and just reactivating them. Like clearing the date posted and then saving them. It seems to be fine on my end. I just thought I would call in because now I've heard it from three people. Yep, understandable Everything's seems to be running fine on my end here too Yep Now are all these people in the same office or are they all remote? Remote You guys are all remote, correct? Yes, that's right Yeah, I just asked in our support chat as well. No one else has heard any reports of it. One thing they can always try doing, too, is clearing their browser cache. Yeah, I did suggest that to Shannon earlier, that'd be F. Davies. I'll mention that to Jocelyn as well. Yeah, it's because what the cache does, essentially, is it stores images and files to try and help web pages load quicker that you visit frequently. But if that cache gets filled up quick, especially when it's trying to load pages that change, if that cache is full, it can cause some slowness because it's trying to load old files that are no longer relevant. Right, right. Okay, no problem. I'll mention that to anybody who asks for now, and then we'll just keep an eye on it and report back if we see anything else specifically. Yep, perfect. That's exactly what I was going to suggest. Okay, perfect. Thanks, Tyler. Yep, not a problem. You have a great day. Thanks, Claire. You too. Bye-bye. Bye....
