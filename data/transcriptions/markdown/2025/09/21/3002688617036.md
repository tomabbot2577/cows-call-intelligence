## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hi, is this Larry? This is Jason calling from Maine. Yeah. How are you doing? Hi, who's this? This is Jason from Maine Sequence Technologies, where we provide you with PC Recruiter. Yeah, hi. I have been, since 9.30 this morning, pulling my hair out, trying to figure out why that went wrong. Yeah, absolutely. go ahead apparently a couple weeks ago i was getting the suspicious emails from microsoft and uh exchange saying that my uh what do you call it was uh almost at maximum uh emails and then when i looked at the the domain, it looked suspicious, so I ignored it. And then today, I couldn't send any emails. And then I called the Geek Squad. And after many, many hours speaking transatlantic, it didn't get resolved, so I started looking into it myself. and I think I might have resolved this, except now it says that none of my apps are going to work because I authorized a two-step authorization process. Okay. Have you tried sending an email from PC Recruiters today? Yeah, I just did. It works. but now I run into another problem after all these hours I finally got the email working but now what the problem is it tells me that my apps are not going to work because it requires a two-step verification do you know anything about that? I wouldn't know I know PC Recruiter but outside of that I'm not entirely sure so I'd be able to help with anything related to PCR but outside of that I'm not entirely sure yeah I think I've got the PCR component let me just think through if there's anything no I think I've got that figured out do you know what an authenticator is? authenticators a lot of the time are like you download an app on your phone and it'll ask you to put in a specific number into your authenticator app. So like when you go to authenticate, it'll show you like the number 42. And then you open the authenticator app and you would put in the number 42 into it, basically verifying that you are who you say you are. Okay. Yeah, so that's what those typically are. Is your email host Microsoft, correct? yeah yeah so it sounds like they might want you to get the authenticator app which you just you basically just download the app and sign in to your email account on the Microsoft authenticator app and then it pretty much walks you through from there so you just want to get that authenticator alright thank you absolutely you have a good day Larry I finally got this thing figuring it out. Thank you. Yep, absolutely. Bye....
