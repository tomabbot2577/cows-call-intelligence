## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is McKenzie. How can I help you? Hi. So this is John Hickerson with Survival Systems Staffing. I guess I talked with someone on the team a couple of days ago about reindexing our database under Lucene so we can use the AI functions and just haven't seen it pushed through to our side yet. Sure. Let me take a look. Let me pull up your account. Give me one second. Thank you. What was the last name? How do you spell it? Nickerson, N-I-C-K-E-R-S-O-N. Ah, okay. I heard something different. Okay, that makes sense. Gotcha. John at survivalsystems.com. Yep, yep. Okay, I was spelling John wrong and I heard a different name. All right, so now I can find you in our other ticketing system. Give me another second, sorry. Okay, I can take a look at your setup. I can do the upgrade to Lucene right now. It takes a while to complete, but I can kick it off for you. So let me see. Your database and your database. And it's going to be the one that's labeled uploaded data. Because I guess we have like four in there. We've got a sandbox and some other stuff. Gotcha. Okay. so I just kicked off the update it does take a bit there's like a process that has to I just basically updated some contents of the file and then there's an automated process that checks every so often about these files and if there's any changes and if there are they update the databases so it might take like till tomorrow but that is just something it's going to do and then let me make sure that you have the actual upgrade feature in there. The person you were talking to on the ticket might have already added this. I think it was Garrett. Okay, no, he did not. So once the Lucene index is over, you should be good to go. So anytime within the next probably 10 hours or so, you'd be all set, ready to go with the AI search and everything else AI as well. And you guys probably have this already on your website. Is there, switching to that different indexes, there's differences in, like, I know a lot, you know, while we're doing it is so that the AEs don't have to run their own list, I guess, or we don't have to run them for them as much. Are there differences in, like, Boolean, like, search strings? And do we use, like, different, you know, like right now I use capital AND or for different functions. Is there anywhere I can look up if there's any difference for the Lucene? I would think the Boolean commands would be the same okay it's just accessing a different index than it would be before because the keyword index is different than the Lucene index but they should I don't think you'd change the behavior in the Boolean okay I just figured I have some saved searches and stuff but obviously you know, I got to change those if we're trying to move forward here either way. Right. So, all right. Well, thank you so much for your help. I'm glad, you know, I'm glad you were able to take care of that for us. Yeah, no problem. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's it for now. Really appreciate it. All right, John. All right. Well, glad we can take care of that for you. Have a good rest of your evening. Yep. You too. Thank you....
