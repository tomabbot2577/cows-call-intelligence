## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hey, Ms. Robin. This is Tom Zellany calling from Denver. How are you? I'm a little sore, but I'm good. You're a little less sore? Sore. I had a rough weekend. I had a buddy who bought tickets to go see Metallica, and the girl that he was going with couldn't go. And these were like pit passes, like $1,500 a ticket. He's like, hey, man, do you want to go see Metallica? I was like, is there a mustache in Mexico? Let's go. So, yeah, that was Friday and Sunday. And I'm getting a little old to be mixing it up in the mosh pit, but I did. And this guy in the mosh pit, he kneed me really hard. It was totally by accident. But I had my phone and my keys and my like earplug container in like my fatigue pants in my pocket and they jammed into my my thigh so hard. I have a bruise that's like six inches by eight inches and it hurts to walk. So anyway, you have to tell. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, it was great. So let me see. Friday was suicidal tendency. No, no, no. Friday was Limp Bizkit. They opened for Metallica. And then Sunday was Suicidal Tendencies. They warmed up the crowd. And then Pantera was the opener. And Metallica was the closing act. So it was fun. It was fun. But I didn't get back until Monday morning at about 2 o'clock in the morning. So yesterday was kind of rough. Today is doing better. So I'll be good by tomorrow. By 4th of July, look out. I'll be ready to go again. Wow. So anyway, enough about me. How have you been? Pretty good. Pretty good. Excellent. Hold on one second. I just got a reply. One of my coworkers is messaging me about setting up a comm like I already got on schedule. So what's up? So what can I help you with? Okay. I know you're really busy. So one of my users cannot access roll-ups. She got an error message, and she forwarded it to me, and it's really small. Let's see if I can see it here. Access denied for resource pipeline templates. So I went into systems users, found her, looked at permissions, and I can't see, like, where she's not approved to see pipeline templates. hmm access denied for resource pipeline templates I'm gonna be I'm gonna receive in a particular position okay so the database is Aspen Associates right yes I'm gonna even just go in as a different user an admin user I'm going to do you can go in as me she's not an admin Is it one particular job she's going into or what's her username? Let me look at her security. It's BPO I think it's BPOW. Okay got it. All right let's see what their securities are. She's got access to positions. Position attachments though. I wonder if that would have anything to do with it. If you want I can forward you the error message. I don't know if that's helpful. Oh I see why. She doesn't have access to interviews. So interviews is kind of like the old word for anything that happened the pipeline so that that is probably what it is so if you go to system yeah security yeah and then rex it's not um under security you're going to go under other okay that's at the bottom so in the first column under others like four down no three down um for In interviews, you'll probably want to at least do, I mean, depends. Is she going to be moving people in the pipeline? She could, yes. Okay. So I would at least do add, save. If you don't want her deleting people out of the pipeline, then just do add, save. If she can delete somebody out of the pipeline, too, then do add, save, delete. No, we'll just have add, save. Okay. Perfect. And then the other thing you might want to do is placements. which is in that other section, but it's in the middle and towards the bottom. Because right now she wouldn't even see if somebody's in that placement panel. She wouldn't even see the placement panel. So I don't know if you want to at least do read only, or if she's going to be adding placements too. Okay. And that is the first column? Second column, second from the bottom, but still in that other section. placements okay so we'll do add save okay okay and then that should fix it she just didn't have access to the pipeline okay well I didn't I didn't know interviews were pipeline stuff so yeah we got it we literally throughout peace recruiter used to call it interviews and then And then we did the redesign with a new pipeline. But that's when we started going to the word pipeline because everyone would think, so like interview is as truly only like a face-to-face or phone interview. It's really like any step in the interview process. Got it. So we're trying to change the terminology, but it's not changed everywhere yet. I understand. Well, perfect. Well, that's exactly what we needed. So I've got it saved, so she should be able to access everything. and if anything blows up in the meantime, I'll let you know. But I hope you have a wonderful 4th of July. You too. And that should fix it. If not, give me a call back, okay? Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, Robin. All right. Have a good week. Bye-bye. You too. Bye....
