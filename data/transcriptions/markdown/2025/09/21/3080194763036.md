Let's see. Building control integration, right? Correct. Yep, you got it. Okay. All right. You're currently licensed for one user. You want to go to two? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Let's see. I'm so sorry. All right, I'm not going anywhere. You want to add two or three? Okay. Here's a ticket that will have your billing adjusted. Did you need any help setting up the user? Are you comfortable doing that? I've never done it before. Okay. Probably best we do a screen share. Okay. Let me. I see you there. I'm going to send you a meeting advice. Meeting advice. Okay, in a moment you should get an email from me. It will be Robin Montoni. Hi, Robin. And then when you get the link to join the meeting, it's going to ask you about joining with your camera and microphone. You don't need to do that. You just need to click the link and we're just going to screen share since we're already on the phone. I've got the link on. Opened it. Okay. So, if you like join the call or... Being processed. Additional users, reply. I don't see anything else. She's got another one for me. It would have come from Robin at Main Sequence, though. I said a support. It doesn't. This says assign to Davisha Perkins. Yeah, that's your ticket for the increase in users. but you should have got another email from me too. So far just one. Okay. I wonder if my direct mail is being a little slow. If I can send it again. Our computer is slow too. We went from server-based to cloud-based a couple weeks ago. Boy, was that fun. Okay. I thought I at least hit it. We'll see. We'll do it again. All right. I haven't seen anything. that's really odd okay anything new in the mail jayhill at bci controls.com right spell it right b-c-i-c-l-i-n-g yeah okay and nothing's getting blocked like or going to spam or anything like that i don't see it there Okay. I could possibly, we have an external company that scans this. And I think sometimes when they catch it, I don't get it until tomorrow. Oh. Do you have any of Chrome on your computer? Computer? Or the Google account? The Google account? Yeah, I have Google Chrome. Okay. Do you have the option where you can go to the, I guess they call it the waffle, with all your Google apps? And do you have meat up there? The waffle and all your Google apps. Yeah, the top right of your Google account. I don't know if you'll have that unless you have an email account, though. I'm not really sure. I don't see anything like that either. I'm being difficult. I'm sorry. Okay, no worries. Okay, I could try just reading it off to you. Try this. Open up your browser and go to meet.google.com. and then a slash and then this is where it gets a little tricky here. Well, not as clear. You're going to put in P as in Peter F as in Frank. Hold on a second. Okay, meet.google.com. Yeah, meet.google.com. I didn't put a dot in there. I think you just go to there. Slash. Meet.google. Hold on. I'm going to see if it doesn't ask you. Okay, when you go to meet.google.com, Does it say enter a code or nickname? I don't see anything like that. Okay. Let's try this then. All right. Okay. Okay, so aftermeet.google.com with a slash, the code's going to be P-S-W. Hold on. I can't type this late in the day. I should call you tomorrow morning. All right, go ahead. Okay, so meet.google.com slash PSW-PQJM-VDW. And let me know what you got when you hit enter. What you got when you hit enter. One second. Google Meet interop dash cloud video interop for Meet.

I'm not sure what that is. Why are you not getting the invite that I'm sending you? That's what's kind of weird. Sounds like that would be easier, huh? Yeah. I wonder why jhill at bcicontrols.com, right? Right. I got your first one you sent. We could wait until tomorrow and see if it shows up in my spam. I'm going to try a different email to you. I wonder if you're just getting blocked for links or something. because basically what you'll want to do as an administrator you have to go to system users manage users and add the user so you also want to make sure as you're adding the person there's a copy settings from username and if you don't do that then um they don't get like the right layout I'm going to do another email let's see let's see if we get this I guess I've ever had an issue with sending messages to anybody.
