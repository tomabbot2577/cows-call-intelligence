## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, Robin, what's up? Hey. All right. Okay, I swear to God, it was somebody that was in collections because I was looking through activities or something, and it was like an email that they sent out. Okay. What was the activity? Oh, maybe it was Peterson Consulting. Hold on one second. because there's some I think this is where I found it yes they emailed Jim Lombardo asking if it was like legit like is this like kind of spam email and basically what did they write this was an odd email and I just want to bring your attention I don't know who they are or how they got my email address. And what is this for? So BMC Consulting, so Brian Michael Cain, has been providing consulting and technical services around Peer Secreter for over a decade. It's now IT Logistics, whatever. And we were introduced by two of the longest-serving experts behind Peer Secreter, Brian Cain and Jared Yusmani. so together at IT Logics we continue to support PCR clients like you we know the PCR recruiter inside out we answer the phone, we solve problems, we care because we've been there since the beginning whether you're looking for support guidance or just some help to help you navigate the path forward so that's the only place I've heard or seen of that, nobody's told me that I just saw it in an email if you go to like Peterson Consulting Group you don't even have to go to the person just go to company and go to activities just some recent activities dated 5-22 Peterson So, I guess it was sent to Todd Schall. You said it's under their email activities? I don't see anything here. Under Peterson Consulting Group. I just went to the company activities, but it was sent to Todd Scholl. S-C-H-O-L-L if you want to go to his name. Yeah, it'll be easier if I go to Todd. But that's how I thought it was going to the company activities. And I don't know why I had a dream of that. I don't know why I thought of it the next day. I'm like, did I have a dream or did I really see that? Remember what I was telling you? I am stoked. Oh, that's funny. Oh. We know many users may be experiencing difficulties with support or more things questions. I'm assuming I mean I know we have some kind of like deal with Kane on that because he technically is I don't know he's like a contractor he's like a contractor I think but I don't know if they should be aren't you like not supposed to be I don't know he definitely has something signed with us I don't know about Jared. I don't know what the deal is with that. I don't think you can limit somebody from working. I just think the direct thing without saying anything is a little questionable. What is the... I'm just saying sending out emails to clients when... I don't know. But if Brian's done stuff with them before, then that's fine. Whatever. I'm just like weird I don't know I'm a little weirded out by all these people that just like quit one day aren't you still weirded out by that with us you mean with us yeah like any time at the time so I like I don't know what did they know that we they were all like one day like boom um i think the i mean like the receivership is like a big thing that's like yeah that a lot of people decided based on that and we were like uh the money stuff and getting paid a lot of people choice based on that um which makes sense i like to understand why they did it when they did but got bills to pay, yeah. Yeah. I don't know, it just seemed like it kind of, yeah, it happened, whatever, it's not as bad. Like, you know, it kind of resolved decently. I wish some of these good ones didn't, like, let's say like a Sean, you know. But I guess when you don't know, you're going to just try to take care of yourself. Yeah, but also, I think Sean had been, he had been, well, he had been looking because of the like paycheck stuff that we had all basically all year um and the job that he got like it was too good as an opportunity to pass up oh really no yeah he got it was more pay um the hours were a little bit better and he got like the benefits were there he had like stock options and stuff like that. Good for him then. And obviously we lost our vision and dental. Oh, both. I'm on my husband's insurance. I was annoyed. We lost it right before I had a dentist appointment. It was super annoying. And dental stuff is not cheap at all. I can get my own plan i just haven't looked at it yet um but i went i used it a lot last year so i'm not super super worried about it um but at least it's not yet i just got close and they said something about steve said something in the one email about looking at the other options although i don't know that i really believe that but whatever like i don't think they're yeah i've been on my husband since we got married. It's been a long time. I just got to worry about that. Although even his insurance has changed. The first year we were married, I think it was... Let's see. He fell off our roof and had knee surgery and then I got pregnant with my son. So in that first year, yea...
