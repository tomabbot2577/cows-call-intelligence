## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, Garrett. I was hoping that you could help me. I am a new user on PCR and Outlook, and I need some help getting my PCR and my Outlook connected. Okay. No problem. What's your name and what company are you with? My name is Dawn. Last name is Conwell, C-O-N-W-E-L-L. The company is TransDirectUSA. Oh, there we go. Perfect. All right. So let's jump on a screen share that way. You better see what your outlook setup is. So in a new tab in your browser, go to meetings.ringcentral.com. OK, one second. I got like so many screens open. So in my browser, go meetings. Yep, meetings.ringcentral.com. Okay, so let's join the meeting. Perfect. And it'll probably ask you for a meeting ID. Right. Okay, that's 837-889-580. It's amazing that you guys can do this. It says join audio or continue with audio. I guess it doesn't matter, huh? I guess continue without audio since we're already on the phone. That'll work. And then just click that blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. I have two screens open. I guess just choose one and we could drag anything over to that screen if it's not on the right one. Okay. Perfect. I can see that. I can see the screen that has RingCentral pulled up. Perfect. All right. So first off, we need to make sure that you have Outlook Classic installed on your computer. Outlook New is not compatible with our portal add-in. So to check that, go to that search bar down at the bottom. Okay, yeah, so this is outlook new, but you still might have outlook classic just look for outlook in that search bar there Classic yeah, there we go. Go ahead and open up outlook classic While we're waiting on this, do you remember at any point installing Java or the PCR Launcher? Those are two programs that kind of run in the background. You know what? I had been with this company back in March, and I just came back, and I had to bring my computer over to my boss's house and drop it off because I am so bad at this stuff. Okay, cool. yeah let's getting it ready to go she did everything on it Garrett so I'm not really sure not a problem we could do a quick test to make sure that those are installed if you want to well okay this is ready now is that the correct email account? Yes, it is. Okay, go ahead and hit connect. Okay, and then uncheck the box that says set up Outlook mobile on my phone too and just hit done. Okay, we'll let that load for a second there. Okay. All right, go ahead and minimize Outlook that we just opened here and open up PC Recruiter. You have that in a tab up top there in your browser all the way at the top left. Yeah, I got you stuck there though, so. Okay, there we go. Oh, I'm sorry. I was going to leave. Okay. Perfect. So then click on the lightning bolt at the top right and select name. And then click parse from resume. And then start at the bottom right. We should see a window pop up here if you have a Java and Launcher installed. If nothing's popping up, looks like we're still going to need, yeah, it would have popped up by now. So let's work on getting Java and Launcher installed on your computer. Go ahead and close this pop up. open a new tab in your browser I got you up there can I move that okay there you go yep and then go to java.com j-a-v-a calm perfect click on download Java for desktops towards the bottom there again Yeah, I clicked that again.
