## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello. Hello. I'm going to mute in the meeting. Otherwise, I guess I'll get a little echo on my side. Are you training with Garrett? Yes. Okay. I'm just going to head back. Well, I have two other people in my office that are training, too. So should I do that and then do this? Because I don't want to make them late. Let me just say real quick. Go to where it says add or remove programs. So down your window search. type add okay pick that I had to remove perfect click on that and it'll come another year which that's not the window search okay that's the wrong one then okay okay go to apps up at the top let's try that go to again that's me in the control painting okay go to settings go to settings they keep moving around and try programs and features it just depends on your version of Windows try programs and features maybe. Why is it not alphabetical? Third column. Third column programs and features okay. If it's not there. Install or change a program. Let's go out of here then. I don't like that view. Let's go to type settings down at the bottom left. Microsoft keeps moving this around. So go to system settings. First, where it says best match for the top. Okay. Everything goes on the other one. Okay. Let me type. At the left. Hold on, let me tell my team that we're a minute late. I'll let Garrett know. Yeah. Okay, so I texted them. So where do I go here? Okay, go to Apps. And go to Installed Apps, first option. Is this a new computer or anything? Yes, it is. Oh, that's why. So you probably need Java and Launcher. Okay, go down to the Js. I probably need to work on that. Okay, missing that. And then go to the P's. And you look for P's Recruiter Launcher. Okay. I know you're running late. I'm going to send you the two links of apps that you need to install. If you have any trouble running them, my phone number will be in the email, and you can give me a call back after your meeting. All right, perfect. Thank you. Oh, no problem. Have a good meeting with Garrett. Thank you. Thanks. All right. Bye....
