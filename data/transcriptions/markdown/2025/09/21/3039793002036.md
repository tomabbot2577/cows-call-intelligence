## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Mackenzie. How can I help you? Hi, it's Jeanette from Job.com. How are you? Hi, I'm fine, Jeanette. How are you? Doing pretty good. I have a question for you about we just switched our contractors to timesheets in PCR. and some people don't use cell phones or can't download the, you know, the thing where you download the app from the app store on the cell phone. So I called in last week. I can't remember who I talked to, but we tested the web portal. So if you didn't know the password, you click on the web portal for the contractors and then it clicked forgot password. And he tested the whole thing while I was on the phone with him and it worked. but we have a guy now who says it doesn't work and it when he clicks forgot password he never gets the email after that and i just tested it on the separate gmail account and i've done it three times and when i've hit forgot password so you put in your email address and your last name i still haven't gotten the password and it's been like 30 minutes do you know if there's an issue with that uh yeah let's take a look uh there could be a couple things that are the issue so let's let me pull up your account and i tested mine on a gmail i tested mine on a gmail account that i'd not used before um check the junk mail folder nothing like i said it's been some time and i've tried a couple of times but i stayed on the phone with him the whole time and and when he tested it uh there last week and it worked so i'm not sure something's going on All right. Give me a sec, Jeanette. I've got to catch up to where you're at because I have to, one, verify that I'm looking at the right person. Is this – well, I can't say it unless I know. Hold on one second, Jeanette. it's my name's GINNETTE but if you're looking under job.com I would be under there probably and I could even email you the contractor letter we send out it's got the link to the timesheet web portal in it. Jeanette Jamerson, okay, found you. Sorry it took me so long to find you for some reason. All right, well I found you. I'm going to log in here. Are you logging into to the job.com database? Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep. Okay. And Robin set this all up for us. Yep. Okay, all being done out of the job.com database. Okay. Mm-hmm. Would you want me to forward you the email? It's just the regular email that was in there that goes to the contractors that's got the link? I do not need that, actually. Okay. I am seeing one thing. Are you an administrator inside this database? Yeah, but I use a different admin. OK, it's fine. I use a different admin module. Inside the PCR database, could you go to the system menu for me and then search out just the word outgoing? And there will be one thing that pops up called outgoing mail settings. Do you see the outgoing mail settings? Yes, it's logging back in. Sorry, because I was logged out, so I didn't screw up this user thing. So give me two seconds here. No problem. No problem. So systems have been going. Yeah, outgoing. Okay, outgoing mail. Yeah, outgoing mail settings. If you click on that, a window will pop up. You'll see a bunch of different fields, mail type, SMTP server name, SMTP server password, stuff like that. So this is the credentials that are used for the automated emails that come from the system. If you hit that tab connection button, it appears that the authentication is failing, which means that at some point since it was working, the settings were changed and these settings are not correct. So as soon as you remedy this screen, then you should be good to send them out again. Because this would be the settings that that email is being sent from. So I don't know what they were before, but these current settings are not working. Okay. I can find them because I set up the other stuff. So if you send individual emails out of PCR to users in the database, does that use something different? Yeah. So this is like the whole system's email address, or you could say the PCR sends these credentials out if it's like an automation or something like that. But if you want to edit your personal email settings, then you have to search out email alias list. And you could have multiple aliases per username that you send email from. And those come from like if you go to the compose email screen, you can select from your alias because it's coming from you as the user. But yeah, any automations or anything like that will come from the outgoing mail settings. So yeah, there's kind of two areas to set up email. and the one that's definitely the issue I can like almost guarantee it. Yep I think it is because we had to change the SMTP password because we use SendGrid so and nobody knew what the other password was so this is it definitely. I think it's the username field API key is not a SMTP username or maybe I'm wrong I you know what maybe I'm wrong because I don't really I'm not really familiar with SendGrid. But typically, I enter in an email a...
