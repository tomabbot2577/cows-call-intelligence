## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Garrett, Randy Fawcett, Veil Search down in Sarasota, Florida. How are you? Good. How are you? Good, man. I got another dumb question for you, Brainiacs. Can you help me fix something in my Canada? Yeah, sure. No worries. When I pull up and just hit name record, it comes up first name, last name, city. every single time. I got to switch that from city to state. Ah, okay. Yeah, if you switch it to state and then down below that under basic search, there's a little checkbox that says save as default. You can check that. See, I swear to God, you guys should run the freaking world. You know, every... God damn it, it worked. Look at that. Is there anything I can do to help you? No. Like a bottle of wine? I mean, I think I've dealt with you like four times. Last four times I've called in, you know everything. You should be running that place. Do we need to get you a bonus or some type of promotion? no no i'm happy to help anytime and um another cool thing with that feature too let's say um you're searching for people in the state of ohio over and over again this week you can actually put a value to the right of state and save that as your default you know temporarily um so it doesn't just save what's in the drop downs but also any values you type in will be there by default okay Okay. All right. Well, that's going to be my pay grade. I'll play around with that, but I appreciate the help, buddy. Thank you very much. No problem. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye....
