## 💬 Full Transcript

 This is Gina. How can I help you? Hi, Gina. It's me, Mackenzie, again, at PC Recruiter. Yeah, hi. I'm calling back because I'm making your ticket, and I realized we didn't try one thing, and I was hoping you had another five minutes or so to just try something for me real quick. Sure. Okay, great. So we don't need to hop on a screen share. I'm just going to walk you through it. So could you please for me go to any capturable screen? So a LinkedIn profile or a Zoom info profile. You don't have to actually capture them. Just bring up a profile and then bring up the capture tool. Okay. I have somebody on my screen right now. Okay. And then click to capture them so that the capture tool actually appears in the right side of your screen. My goal is to see if this works. We're going to add, if it's okay with you, I would like to try adding fields to the layout of the capture tool because the capture tool will always show you all the information that it's capturing. So in order for these fields to capture, you might actually need to add fields to the layout to capture them, right? So we're going to add the fields work phone and work email, if you don't mind. and then I'll ask if you try to capture a Zoom info if those populate. Because as I was writing the ticket, I realized we didn't even try this, and that would be the first thing that the developers ask. Did you even try to add the field? And then it was like, oh, yeah, duh. So, yeah, let's try and add them. So do you have the capture tool on your screen? Yeah, hold on. Let me switch you over to my headset. Hold on one second, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry if I'm too loud or something. I don't know. Or not loud enough? No, no. Hold on. OK, can you hear me? Yeah. OK, perfect. So let me just capture this person, find this person first, because I was literally going to add him to at .. Hopefully this person is there. Of course not. Okay. Okay, hold on. So we're not really capturing, we're just adding someone, right? Yeah, you don't need to capture anyone yet. First, I want to add fields to the layout of capture tool, which doesn't require that you capture anybody. OK, fantastic. So I'm there. Yeah. So we need the capture tool like appearing on the right side of the screen where it's showing the actual fields. Sure. Yeah. It'll say, you know, overview contact information. Yes. OK, so at the very, very top on the top right, there's a button that's like a square with a pencil. and if you hover it, it says edit field configuration. Okay, clicking. Yeah, okay. So then that will put the capture tool into like the edit mode. And so under contact information, could you add two fields to that widget and select work phone and email underscore work? Okay, one second here. uh, plus sign. So add a plus sign. Okay. So contact info. Yeah. Another one will appear down below, change the dropdown to the field you want. And you're hoping to capture to like the work email and the work phone field. So try to add those two fields there. It'll be, I guess, phone underscore work and phone underscore email or email underscore work. Sorry. I was talking too fast. Okay. So under contact information, you want me to hit the plus sign and you want me to add what again? Yeah, the plus sign will add another field to the layout there. And then you can change which fields appear. So the third one down, because I think you only had two fields. So you could have added a third. So the very bottom one, you can change it and try to change that to email underscore work is the work email field. OK, so hold on one second. I need to get rid of this. I have all this little tools on the side and it keeps popping up. Come on. Hold on. Hold on. Bear with me. I know what I'm doing. Bear with me. It's okay. I'm not rushing you. Okay. It's gone. All right. So, okay. So, there was only two now. When I clicked the plus sign, it added another field. and now I'm clicking on the drop down and then I will be selecting what again? Scroll down to email underscore work. Okay, got it. And that's the work email field. And then add another field and try and find your alternative phone field. For you, it might be called work phone. Okay, yeah. And then save that. Once both of those fields are added, in the top corner of the capture tool again, there will be like a floppy disk icon for saving this change that you've made. Okay, what? Phone. And after you do that, I would kind of want you to close the capture tool and refresh the page so that it opens fresh and make sure those fields appear again. Like, make sure it's saved, you know. Okay, so. Okay, I'm refreshing now. Then I'm going to go back, click to add. I want to make sure that it's there. Okay, so contact. Oh, yeah. Okay, so contact information now has email address, cell phone, email work, email underscore work, and then work phone. okay cool so now if you could capture a zoom info profile and just tell me do those fields that you just added do those populate with any...
