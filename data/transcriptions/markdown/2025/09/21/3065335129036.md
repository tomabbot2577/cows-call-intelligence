So I might want to adjust that for you. So we had a billing system. We've changed billing systems, and we've been sending the invoices to Melanie underscore Kirk. Mm-mm. No? Okay. Okay, so is it the end Kirk? Okay, let me fix that for you now. Okay, let me fix that. The other thing was is I got this note that said, I think it was in the mail, and it's something about people were trying to get your receivables or something yeah that's real longer it was kind of it yeah we've resolved that now what I'm going to do here though I'm going to take off because a couple late fees were added so I'm just going to clean that up for you hold on one second So that's going to adjust this total. This one only. Okay. Fix that one. And then there's one other one where there is a late fee. Yeah, so we haven't received payment in five months. Okay. So it's about $150. I can't remember the rate. So let me see. I'm going to give you a new total because the new system applies late fees after 30 days. So the total owed is $365.05. My goodness. Yeah. So it's five months of $73.01. Do you want to give me the card over the phone and then I can set it up for auto pay for you? Well, I don't want to pay that balance for it today because I don't have it. Okay. So what we can do is we can pay on my next payday, but let's not get behind. Make sure you're sending me those invoices to the correct email address. Yeah, I've got that fixed for you. Is there anything that you could pay today so that we can get it turned on? I could pay about $150. Okay. Why don't we do that? Okay, so let me go over here. I think we have an Apple. Let's call it. Is that where I am? No, no, no. No, no. Let's go to PayPal. Let me open up. Empyrean. Okay. And please send it to our address. Yes. I've got that all fixed. I have the late fees off now. Okay. So here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to take. Okay. All right. I'm going to add your name in here. Hold on one second. I'm going to clean things up a little bit. I'm going to add your name. Oh, darn it. How did I do that? Okay, so they gave me this virtual debit card because my other card had fraud on it. And so I see the last four digits on it. I could pay you for PayPal. Do you have PayPal at all? I don't think we have PayPal on this. there's a credit card on here I just add your PayPal debit card to your favorite stores because I don't have the physical card with me because oh that's my problem I'm going because I can pay you right now I would just have to let me see what add bank cards add store cards add cash card let me go to this and see if I can get a routing yeah this this one is it's a it's a asking for a card number you're right i understand what you're saying you understand what i'm saying yeah i can't yeah i need like the full number of the expiration okay yeah get the most out of your card activity okay man if i wish i just had my freaking card. Apple wallet. Let's go here. Okay, it's active. And then I request a physical card. Oh, damn it. Okay. Oh, you're all set up. No, I'm not because I can't see it. Yeah, usually they kind of mask everything for security. I mean, I understand that, but when you're trying to get to it and own the card and own the money, it doesn't help, you know? I'm the one who owns the money. Yeah. Don't know what to do. So y'all don't have a bank account I could transfer to? We could do ACH. I could send the information over to you. that.
