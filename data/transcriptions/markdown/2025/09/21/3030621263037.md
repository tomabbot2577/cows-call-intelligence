## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hi, I have an open ticket with you guys, and I'm just wanting an update on when I should be able to get support. Sure. Let's take a look. What's your name and what company are you with? So I'm creating a ticket on behalf of one of our clients. My name is Lainey. It should be under my name. And then their company is Qualitech. Qualitech. Okay, let's see. All right, let's see if there's any tickets open under Qualitech. Let's see. Okay. So I see a ticket open here, PCR Outlook Plugins. No, that one was resolved. This is a different issue. Do you have a ticket number at all for that? Oh, I found one. Let's see. This one, what's this topic here? Jason replied about three days ago. He said, can you provide me an email address from the bounces that are sending? So this one about bounces then in Outlook? Yeah, so the client, he sent an email to about 300 people. from PCR and he's only seeing three bounce back messages in his Outlook. Usually it's like way more than that. For bounces, okay. All right, so let me take a look here in the database itself. I'll just log into the Qualitech database. Do you know the database name? There's a few under Qualitech. Let's see, there's Banking, Engineering, Houston, Optics, QTSI, a few more. No, I don't, but I can try and get him on the other line. Okay, yeah, let's try that. All right, do you have a direct line in case I lose you? We don't have direct lines anymore, but you can call back in and ask for Garrett if you use that same phone number you called. Okay, let me try and add him now. Just give me a second. I'm going to put you on hold here. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. . You have reached the office of Mike Vineyard. I'm either on the phone or out of the office. Okay. I can leave him an email real quick. He usually responds pretty fast. Gotcha. All right. What was your question, though? Maybe I can just… So, yeah, if I'm trying to log into PCR as that user, they'll first have to select a database. There's maybe about 14 or so databases under Qualitech. I just need to know which one. Okay. Let me look. Do you see one titled Qualitech? No, yeah, so Qualitech is kind of like the overall account, and then there's about 13 or 14 databases underneath that. Oh, I think it might be under like Pinnacle FES. Oh, instead of Qualitech. Oh, I see. Okay. Let me look up Pinnacle. Yeah, I believe I just recently had to find this out for helping them with their Outlook PCR plugin. I think it's under Pinnacles and then it's Qualitech. I don't know if that's the one he uses specifically, but you should be able to see him in there or not, right? Yeah, I could log in and see if there's... So, what did you say the company was, Pinnacle? What? Was there extra words there at the end? Pinnacle FES, no space. F-E-S. F as in Frank? Yes. Okay. Okay, so we don't have an account with Pinnacle. We have Pinnacle Search, LTD, Pinnacle Sales Recruitment. Yes. Pinnacle Search Professionals. Pinnacle People. Okay, what's the customer's name? Maybe I have their first and last name in our system. Okay, so it's Mike Vineyard. M-I-K-E-B-I-N-E-Y-A-R-D. Okay. Okay, he's coming up under Qualitech Group again, that original database there. Okay, try Houston then. Do you see that? Oh, yeah, I see the Houston one. Okay, let me try that. And I can log in and get a customer list to see his or a user list to see his exact username. Put something like in there. So it doesn't have Mike Vinyard listed in here as his own username. Let's see, is there any other database you would guess? Maybe SEL. Okay, let's try that one. No, yeah, not seeing them. Mike Vineyard listed here. Okay. I could actually just kind of start going through them. Yeah, I believe it's going to be under that. What is it called again? Pinnacle FES. What if I give you the exact name? It's C-O-B-C dot P-I-N-N-A-C-L-E-F-E-S. Okay. Okay, so is that like the database ID there? Maybe I can try this. Let's do ODBC is going to be Pinnacle. There it is. Okay. There, yeah, I do have Pinnacle FES as a part of a web address to get to the login screen. I got that. And then Qualitech is underneath that. Okay, this is getting us in the right place. Okay. Okay, and this should be under there. The usernames I have are admin, copy, Gina R, and Sam R are the only usernames under Qualitech. there is a second database there's only two databases under Pinnacle FES one's called Qualitech and one's called Config maybe he's in Config no okay nothing Config so he might be just under the username okay a different email he uses but this is not what that mass email was sent from Yes. Oh, Mike Vinyard at QCGLP.com. Okay. Yeah, I'm not sure. He's not listed in the user list here. So yeah, basically the information we'll need from him is his PCR login web address, the database he uses, and his username. And then we can check all the settings for email and make sure it's all connected and...
