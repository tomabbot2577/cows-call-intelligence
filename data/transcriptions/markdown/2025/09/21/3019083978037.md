## 💬 Full Transcript

 Yes, they send me a voicemail. Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Gary. How may I help you? Hi. I have a question on some functionality. Am I in the right place? Yeah. Can you help with that? Okay, awesome. I need to... Basically, I have a roll-up list, and I need to mirror the quick comments and the statuses. Is there a way to do that? what do you mean by mirror the quick like I want to put them on another list I basically copy them over but but whenever I copy the statuses and the quick comments do not come with it is there a way I can like mirror you know what I mean I see what you're saying yes so the quick quick comments yeah those are specific to each roll-up I don't think there is a way to copy those over to a new one. I'll double check in my test database right here, but I don't remember there being a way to copy. Like I know when I move people from one list to another, the quick comments move with it. But if I copy, they do not. So I'm wondering if I can make like a duplicate basically of a roll up, if I can just kind of duplicate it and then I can take that duplicated list and move them over and the quick comments will go with them. Let's see. Let's jump on a screen share so I can see kind of what you're working with there. So if you go in a new tab in your browser, just go to meetings.ringcentral.com. Meetings.ringcentral.com. Perfect. Uh-huh. And it should be prompting you for a meeting ID. Yes. Okay, so that is 072-125-704. Okay. Okay. Okay. And if it asks about joining with audio, you can say continue without audio since we're already on the phone. And then just click the blue share button down at the bottom and select your entire screen up at the top. It's saying it would like to record. You can allow that. That's fine. It will basically require that to just share the screen. It won't actually be recording. Okay. It's asking me to open up my system preferences. Oh, okay. Hopefully, they gave you a clickable alert there, so you can jump right to the right place just by clicking on it. Okay. It says Google Chrome will not be able to record the contents of your screen until it is quit. Do I quit and reopen or just say later? If you say later, let's try to share your screen again, but if it blocks you, then we we can just quit and reopen. Okay. There we go. I can see that. Okay. So if you are, yes, you're opening up a roll-up list. Okay, so let me let me open up an example for you. Okay, so let's say this one. See how there's all these quick comments and statuses? Right, okay. Yeah, I see what you mean. I need to mirror this. Yeah, I need to merge a bunch of lists together, but I need all of this information to go with it. it. Okay and did you try the select all and then going to copy up in the menu at the top? Yes I can copy it over no problem but none of this information is going to go with it. Right yes so you just need to yeah in each quick comment those are roll-up specific I don't really think there is a way to copy this over. It's just set up for each roll-up individually. Now is there a way I can copy this exact list, like make a duplicate? The only way to really do that is to select all and then go to copy in the action menu. Okay, so there's not a way. Okay, yeah that's what I was talking about. Yeah, sorry we couldn't help you out there. It just doesn't have that functionality, unfortunately. unfortunately no worries okay thanks a lot thanks have a good one you too bye...
