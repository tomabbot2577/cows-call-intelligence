## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence Technology. This is Garrett. How may I help you? Hey, Garrett. It's Ryan at KBassman. Hi. Hey. Question for you. In analytics, when we look at communications and look at outgoing email, it's showing not just emails sent to people in the database. it's showing all outgoing emails that are sent regardless through PCR or through Outlook. How do I segment those so that I can see, you know, just regular emails versus emails sent to people in the database? The PCR analytics is only built on activities, those metrics. So when an activity is generated, that will add in a metric. so it can't show any metrics from anything sent to like people who aren't name records because an activity needs to be generated for an analytic metric to appear okay can you look at a user for me and tell me maybe I'm just reading it wrong this is for what is our DBC album The Sunny Side LLC. So T-H-E-S-O-N-N-I-E Side LLC. Okay. And the user is A. Boyson. Let me try that. So the O-D-B-C is T-H-E-S-U-N-N-I-E? S-O-N-N-I-E. Oh, it was the O. Okay. There we go, Sunnyside LLC. And then what was that user again? Allison Boyson. So I think it's A. Boyson. Okay. How do you spell the last name? B as in boy, O-Y-S-O-N. A. Boyson. That didn't work. Let's try Allison. Here, I'll log in as admin and then take a look at the username. I was going to say maybe she's using admin. Oh, she is using admin. Okay. All right. So let me go over to analytics then. And the only reason I'm questioning is because there's, in the analytics of the outgoing emails, support at dimensionalsearch.com is in there. and I would severely doubt that there's a name record for it. Oh, okay. I'll check on that. If there's a name record, then call me an idiot and I'll leave you alone. That's all right. Let's see. So I'll just go name. Email. Oh, wait. Actually, let me do a quick search. That's probably better. support at dimensional search. Let's see if I can spell that right. Dimensionalsearch.com. Okay, yeah, it's not coming up with somebody with that email address. All right, so let me jump over to analytics and look at what you're looking at. So you went to metrics communications on the left. And then what is your... And then pretty much just any of the outgoing. Okay. emails going email sent sent to support at the initial search I see that top one there record Allison activities Okay. It looks like Allison has her own name record in PCR. So any emails that are sent or received. because her email address is attached to her name record yeah exactly okay that makes sense okay i'll have her remove it then yeah i would take that out and then it'll be more private anyway uh excellent yeah yeah okay perfect that's an excellent answer and i don't know why i didn't think about that so thank you very much and have a great rest of your day you too thanks...
