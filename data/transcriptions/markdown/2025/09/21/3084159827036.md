## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hey, thanks for calling Apollo Technical. This is Jacob. How can I help you? Hey, Jacob. Is Ryan Bradshaw in? Bradshaw, he is out for lunch until about 1 p.m. Eastern. Would it be all right if I told him to call you back? Is he a voicemail I could go into? Yeah, let me see. It'll ring to a voicemail, I believe. Give me just a second. Okay. Let me transfer it over to him. Yes, sir. Awesome. This is Ryan Bradshaw with Apollo Technical. I missed your call. Please leave your name and number, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Please leave your message after the tone. When done, hang up or press the pound key. Hey, Ryan. It's Jim with PC Recruiter. I wanted to give you a quick call. I got your email about your trial for the PCRM product. When I went back and did a little research, it looks like that they were trying to turn it on, but they couldn't for some reason get the deals pipeline turned on. I don't even know if you even looked at that with Jim Wise because it wasn't around when you demoed it. So they didn't do it and it kind of got put on hold and I've emailed them to try and find out where things stand with that. I also asked to turn it on without the deals pipeline if at all possible so that we could just Good job. And then looking at it and seeing, that's like a sales funnel available on PC Recruiter there. But I wanted to kind of update you on that. If you have any questions on this, give me a call. I'm going to try and get that turned on. Obviously, we'll do a two-week trial whenever it's on. But we will get that going as soon as possible. Give me a quick call. Let me know if that deals pipeline is of great interest. Or I'm trying to get them just to turn it on regardless. Because I don't know that deals was really a big area of interest for you. My direct line is 440-856-0314. That's 440-856-0314. Thanks....
