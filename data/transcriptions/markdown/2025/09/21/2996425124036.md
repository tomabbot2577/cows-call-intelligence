## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID followed by pound. Enter your participant ID followed by pound. You are in the meeting now. There is one other participant in the meeting. Good morning. This is Jim. Hey, this is JP. How are you? I am well, JP. How are you doing today? Doing good. All right. So I want to take you in here and show you a little bit around PCRM and also the sequencing piece of PC Recruiter. Initially, did you have any questions or have any preference on which one we look at first? So, I, you know, we use PCR, just the standard version of it. And I spoke briefly with your colleague yesterday. You know, we're going, we're looking at SourceWale. and I saw that you guys, it looks like you guys have some like sequencing and outreach stuff that's built into PCR. So I started like poking around with PCRM and like, I'm not exactly sure what it is. So like, it may make sense to just kind of start from the beginning and explain to me what they, what they both are. For sure. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, Let me kind of start with the sequencing because that was brought out before PCRM was released. So the sequencing was a piece that was added to our premium package after you bought the premium package. So you had the premium package. Notably, what it included at the time was email campaigns and the analytics reporting. But what we found is when people were using the campaigns, they could see clicks and opens and replies and all that. wanted to be able to do something with a click or an open or a reply or whatever. So we worked on and built the sequencing piece of PCRecruiter which essentially does very much what SourceWhale does in their sequencing piece but it's built into your PCRecruiter database. So it's not a separate product, there's no export, there's nothing like that and everything is handled inside a PCRecruiter in one area. So what the sequencing does, it gives you the ability to build sequences out within PCRecruiter and you can say usually they'll start with an email and then based on what happens with that email you can say if they reply to it maybe that adds them to a call list as it to a little task list I have within the sequencing screen that I can go ahead and and call or maybe it sends another email and then maybe if they don't acknowledge the email in three days it sends yet another email or something like that so that was set up and added on so it It was something, it wasn't any upgrade in price over what you have now as far as monthly costs. It was like a one-time $250 to set it up and install it. It includes a couple of hours training. And when you have the sequencing, I'm going to show it to you in the current version of PC Recruiter. It actually adds just an additional button at the top of the screen for sequencing up there. And when you click that sequencing, it actually opens a whole new tab. So the sequencing is kind of a whole new area of PC Recruiter, and it's going to have initially your task list showing what you have as far as calls or LinkedIn tasks or items to schedule or anything like that. But then it's also going to have the area where you can go build your templates. And these templates are what I was just talking about where you are able to set up a bunch of different branches within your sequence. So your first one is going to be an email is sent. It's this specific form letter. and then if the email is replied to that's your condition then they're done the sequence is completed but if no interaction occurs within three days you could make it two days one day nine days whatever that continues to the next step which is add them to a call list okay so then for the call you have a number of different conditions that you can mark when you make that call you can select out of a drop down I'll show you where that works but you can mark it connected That means they've completed the sequence left message continues to the next step. That's a second email So no answer would be the next step as well so you can kind of work through this process as many steps as you wish and Some people will set up merely a drip campaign. That is only email campaigns Email pause three days email if they answer it they get another if they don't they get yet another so It might be only emails or it could include things like calls LinkedIn related items it just puts it on a task list it doesn't do it automatically also SMS if you have ring central so I can do some different things within that and the sequence runs on a roll-up list so if you happen to have a roll-up list in your system that has a sequence running on it like my second one does you'll see that little sequence icon is showing there's one running there and there's one running on that one too so that lets me know there's a sequence running on that roll-up list and what's cool is that if If I added someone to the roll-up list right now, they would start that sequence right at the beginning. Or if I added that sequence to this June...
