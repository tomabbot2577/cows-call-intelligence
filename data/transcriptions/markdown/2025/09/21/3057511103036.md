## 💬 Full Transcript

 Welcome to Zoom. Enter your meeting ID. Enter your participant ID. You are in the meeting now. You are the first participant. Please stand by. Thank you. Good afternoon. This is Jim. Hey, Jim, can you hear me? I do. Doug, how are you? I am well. How are you? I'm pretty good, pretty good. Thanks for joining me today. So, yes, I wanted to show you around the PCRM piece a little bit. I wondered kind of what you've heard of it. Have you seen it? Have you heard of any of the features included in it or anything of that nature? I don't know anything about it. As a matter of fact, you mentioned it this morning was the first I had heard. But I had been hearing for the better part of two years how, you know, PCR was going to revamp. and sort of remold everything and all the releases right around the corner. And, you know, here I am, whatever, two and a half years later, looking at pretty much the same exact thing that I've looked at for 10 years with rounded corners. And I thought, I wonder if I'm on that version that everybody's been talking about for years. The new release. So that's what prompted my call. Excellent. Glad you did. Yeah. So this actually has been in development for three or four years. They were kind of working with different things here. And it was originally going to be PCR10. It was originally going to be a new interface for the PCRecruiter9 package. It was going to replace and migrate everyone to it, and that's what they were doing. But it kind of, as you know, got delayed, and we were even told many times, it's right around the corner, right around the corner. They actually ended up adding things to it and kind of developing it, and then they added a lot of CRM functionality. They improved the sequencing feature. They added the deals pipeline. There's some new reporting coming out on the deals pipeline as well. So they actually decided in maybe April of this year just to spin it off kind of into its own product that shares the same PC Recruiter database. So it's PCRM is the name of the product. It's a CRM. So PCRM is where they get that from. And that is going to be something that runs off your same exact database but gives you a whole different interface. Now that being said, it adds some new features, but it also contains almost everything that the old PCRecruiter has, just in a new interface, new screens, new format, and everything like that. A few of the things you're going to notice as I show you around here are going to look the same, like the sequencing and the analytics, if you use either of those. Because when those features were put into PCR9, 10 slash PCRM was already in development, so they kind of built them to look the same way in both. why you might notice they look a little more modern than the PC recruiter you use now because they were designed to fit this piece here so yeah let me show you around just kind of give you a walkthrough of what it's going to look like and how it looks and works and everything like that okay great okay so you see my site in screen here you know so this is the PCR I'm log in what I'm going to do I'm gonna log into my exact same PC recruiter database so if you add this you're going to have the same username same password same databases same data all the integrations still work because it's running off of the same sequel database it's just a different integration a different interface actually a different link from which you can access your data and you'll notice right away we've actually gone away from the up and down top and bottom frame we've actually gone and added the menu down the left side of the screen many of the things are going to be the same terminology like you still see names, companies, positions, roll-up schedule. All those are going to be very familiar so that's going to make it a little bit easier to use. There are some new things like the files workflow and some of the things look quite different. So for example, if I go into names I'm going to be able to look at the new names search screen. It's going to show me the last number of names I looked at so that's going to be my recently viewed records right there. We've added the ability to edit in line so if you needed to edit or change anything from this menu you can do that here and then we've also added the ability to perform actions right from this main menu so I could go contact and send them an email or contact and call them dialing with RingCentral or send them a text or something like that or I could even add an activity a note add it to a roll-up list submit a profile throw some feedback create a presentation so you can do a lot of things right from kind of the main menu here you click on that that note selection for a second Jim right there yeah if you wanted to add one okay all right so that looks the same yeah some of that's gonna look the same so some of the things too like if you look at your schedule schedule looks almost just the same but they haven't changed that it ma...
