Thank you. Thank you. Hi, Jim. Hi, Brittany. How are you? I'm good. So sorry for my tardiness. I just misplaced my time, and I don't have – I need to get, like, notifications on my Google Calendar. Our team always kind of reminds me of the time. So sorry about that. Not a problem at all. Not a problem at all. Well, it's good to meet you. Glad we could talk. Yes. And, yeah, so I wanted to kind of chat with you a little bit just about the general setup of PC Recruiter. Initially, did you have any questions out of the gate? I think you've seen a demo with them. Was there any questions you had before we kind of just talk it through here? Yeah. I don't think so at the moment. Yeah, I guess I've just heard a lot of the value that it brings, so I'm excited to leverage it and use it for my business. Very well, very well, yeah. So what we are, we are the software that comes with a dimensional search office agreement. So you get PC Recruiter, and we are your ATS. So we're going to be the software that's going to track all of your contacts, candidates, jobs, there's email mass marketing capabilities so everything you do is going to happen inside a pc recruiter it'll also integrate with outlook and ring central a few other pieces too so they have special discounted pricing with with us so your pricing is there's a 750 setup that's one time and then 50 per user per month you can add users at any time and i would assume you're just one user for now? Just one for now, yep. Okay, perfect. So you can add users at any time. And are you in the training class October 6th, is it? Yes. Okay, perfect. So what we do is we get you set up on PC Recruiter, and part of what that 750 setup includes is 10 hours of training with one of our trainers. So you actually have two entire organizations supporting you to get trained up on PC Recruiter and recruiting in general and everything so what would happen is we sent over the paperwork so today I'll collect your company name and your street address and your phone number and all your contact info and I'll email you a Panda doc basically just like a DocuSign agreement and once you sign that then I will send over the invoice for the setup in first month so that's 800 bucks that's the upfront due and then we just set up the additional $50 per month to just kind of bill recurring on your credit card. Once that's signed and paid within a day or two you'll get your link. So that's going to be a URL that's going to be your personal PC recruiter database. Once that happens we'll also get you assigned to a PC recruiter trainer. So you would have one person on this end who would be your point person for training, how to's, and they're going to go ahead and get you at least two hours. I think they standardly try to get you set up two hours of training prior to your dimensional search training. So we have a few weeks to get that in. So So they'll kind of give you some basics of the PC Recruiter software itself, help you get it set up, kind of configure some things, and then they have a full integrated training process with Dimensional Search. So you'll get just enough to get you up and running on the system here, and then we'll hand you over to Dimensional Search for that training, and they do a few hours, and then they kind of put you back over to PC Recruiter Trainer. They'll do a few more hours. So they kind of bounce back and forth. So you're getting trained not only on how to recruit and everything in general, but also how to use the system, all the ins and outs of PC Recruiter. and you'll be able to put data in. You own all the data. Everything is yours. And I would be a point person if you ever needed to add users, if you had contract questions, anything like that, or if you didn't know who to talk to about anything here, I can get you to the correct person. So what is going to be your company name and your street address? Yes. So Camber North is the company name. And did you say street address? Yeah. We need it just to make sure we don't have to charge a tax if you're not in Ohio, which you're probably not, but we always have that for our paperwork. Okay. Yep. I'm not in Ohio. I'm in Minnesota. Street address is 2916 Crestwood, one word, Drive, Northeast, Alexandria, Minnesota, 56308. Okay. And the company name was Camber what? North. Canberra North. Two words? Yep, two words. Perfect. And C-A-M-B-E-R? Correct. Groovy, groovy. And I've got your email address. Let me make sure I have that. I think I do. Is that Gmail still going to be the best email address for you at this time?
