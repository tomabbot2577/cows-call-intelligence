## 💬 Full Transcript

 All right. So I have Tyler here. He's part of our production issue verification team. And then we're talking with Ed. How's it going, Ed? All right. How are you? Not too bad. Not too bad. All righty. So what I'm going to do here is thank you again for providing your credentials for us to be able to test this. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to sign in with a code for that Indeed account because it's connected to Google. I'm going to use just the code that it sends you so that can to factor into the account okay so I'm going to hit that sign in with code now you should get an email all right with that code A little slow. Here we go. Ready? Yep. 0-5-9-1-4-0. Alrighty. All right. Now it's going to text you a code as well. Okay. Got that. 576-651. Perfect. So I am in, so now I will go ahead and start doing what I do. I didn't mean to cut you off. I apologize. When I'm in there just searching for candidates to add to my database, the PCR doesn't pop up for me to capture it. When I get a response from a candidate and then I get the email and I click the link to go to their profile, then it works. So the issue is when I'm just searching for candidates to add, if that makes sense. Yep, yeah, we've had a few reports of this. From what it looks like, is that Indeed made some changes to their site? specifically those searching pages. And unfortunately with tool like extensions like the capture tool, anytime like indeed LinkedIn, they actively make changes to their sites to have tools like ours not work because they want you to use their products. So when they make those changes, it does take a little bit of time. We got to figure out exactly what they changed and rework the tool to be able to operate on those pages again. Gotcha. Okay. Well, hopefully you can get it up and running fairly soon, and I appreciate your help. Yep, not a problem. Like I said, now that I'm in, I can go in and start doing my testing, get it up to the developers to start their process. Wonderful. And I have another quick question. I don't know if this is something I need to make another ticket for, But I've noticed that in PCR, the emails that I send aren't showing up in the email tab, if that makes sense. So if I go to someone and I click the emails tab, like I have some from way earlier, like 22, like October of 22 is the last email I have from this candidate. But I know we've emailed each other quite a bit since then. so I don't know if there's a setting I can do. Yeah, let me pop it and take a look here real quick. So the way that emails tab works is if you have a mail server set up in your PCR mail, it syncs and puts those emails there. Now, if your email server got unauthenticated somehow, like you've changed the password or sometimes those connections just expire, that would explain why it's not there anymore. So let me... I just got in there. It's the, yep, mail server got disconnected. I could walk Ed through reconnecting that if you want, Tyler. Yeah, yeah, that works. I'll hop off and start working on the Indeed issue if you want to walk him through that one, Garrett. Perfect. That sounds good. Thanks so much for your help, Tyler. All right, thanks, Ed. Thanks, Garrett. You bet. All right. All right. So if you are, are you currently logged into PCR? Yes. Okay, excellent. So at the top right of your screen, there's a little gear icon next to your logo. Click on that and select email from the dropdown. Got it. And this will open up PCR mail. Look for configure at the top left, another gear icon. Got it. And then go to mail servers below that. Okay. And then in the bottom frame, click the little action drop down on the left next to where it says Gmail IMAP and edit that. Okay. And in this pop-up, who's your provider? Okay, you have Gmail. So you can just click on sign in with Google, the blue button, and that should reconnect you. Okay. Just make sure it grabs the right email address or the right account. Yes. So continue. Okay. I did it. Okay. It is active, yes. Good. So, yeah, if you want to just hit, oh, that'll work. Yeah, hit test connection. And let me know if you see any green lettering in that test result. Oh, good. I do. Yeah. And you're in good shape. At plastics.authority.com, authenticated success. Perfect. Go ahead and close that test and hit save. And then that syncing could take up to 24 hours, you know, if you have tons of folders and things like that. But it could, you know, sync up a lot sooner than that. And the good thing is it'll retroactively start filling in that email tab for some of the recent ones in the last month or two. Those will fill in for you. Awesome. Awesome. Well, that was an easy fix. Thank you very much. Yeah. Happy to help. And we'll keep you in the loop for sure with the Indeed thing. I'll just be emailing you as I hear from the development team. So Tyler is going to pass it off to them shortly here. Wonderful. Wonderful. Well, thanks again for all your help, Garrett. I really appreciate it...
