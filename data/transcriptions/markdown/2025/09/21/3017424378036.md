## 💬 Full Transcript

 Thank you for calling Main Sequence. This is Robin. Hi, Robin. My name is Dawn Conwell, and I am a newer user for PCR, well, at least on this computer I am. And my boss set it up, but I'm not sure if my emails are going out. You know, she's got them on automatic, where you move something into a pipeline, it automatically emails. But I've had a couple candidates this morning that I've had to manually send them application links through my Outlook. and I don't know if you can check on that to see if those are working so what is your username it's dawn see okay let's it come from my required see I did get some invalid email credential things coming in. Okay. Did you change anything with your – no, that looks okay. Okay. Don C2 at TransTurkUSA. Don C2 at TransTurkUSA. Okay. Well, any chance that you did have an issue and then you re-authenticated your email alias? Because there are some errors from yesterday, but I don't see any with today's date. Okay, perfect. It could have just been an oversight on her part. I just wanted to make sure they were getting them. I mean, if they were sent before, like, so if you're logged in. I know yesterday we did have a problem. I was on the phone like over an hour with PCR yesterday. So that wasn't for that. I did have another problem. because what I see if you go into Peace Recruiter and go over the very top right there's a gold number 4 so there definitely were some issues yesterday in the morning but if you go to system on the main toolbar and go to email setup I gotta get out of my mic. One second. Email setup. Okay. And then go to email alias list. You'll see a card that shows your settings. If you click the pencil, like if somebody had just typed a password without doing the sign in with Microsoft option or perhaps maybe change the password. You would have to use that black sign in with Microsoft to authenticate. But if you hit test connection, it is working now. So maybe something was changed. That's what we worked on yesterday, Robin. He had me do all that yesterday where I had to sign in with Microsoft. Okay. So that would fix it going forward, just not backwards so basically what happens okay that's trying to send an email it needs to connect to your mail so we don't actually send them we actually connect your mail server so if i couldn't connect that's why people weren't getting them gotcha okay so we're good to go i appreciate it thank you so much let me actually just check one more thing just in case it was like an automated based on a pipeline step is that what you're Yeah, so I'm moving people into a bucket, and it automatically sends an email that's pertaining to that bucket. Okay, let me see here. Let me just make sure it was supposed to send as you, because then that would explain why. Okay. Do you know what the folder was, the part of the pipeline that it was? For the one that was missed? Yeah. Yeah, it was for Katie. I don't know if that's what you guys go. Like when you dragged it to like what subfolder was it called? Oh, it was email. I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. Email. So silly. One second. Let me get in there. I sent her Intel app one. Intel app one. OK, let me look at this automation plan. Send form letter. Oh. Well, this is actually set to send from the system administrator, not from the user. So it really wouldn't be coming from you. It would be coming from the database email. Intel app on? Yeah. Okay. Because it's not set to even go as you, which would be a different issue. So let me see that then. Okay, so I'm going to get a screenshot of this. Okay, maybe there's an issue with administrator, email setup. So those are actually going from Peggy's email address. And Peggy's is not authenticating. It looks like. Yeah, that's what the problem is. All right. I'm going to compose an email to Peggy because she would have to change as an administrator of the database. Okay. But I'm going to send her all the details, and then what I'll do is I'll copy you. Okay. Sounds perfect. Okay. All right. So as of now, though, are they getting that email or no? Probably not because at least for that step, there's an option when they create an automation plan. And so they come from essentially the database outgoing mail settings, which is sometimes like a generic account like careers ad or jobs ad that they're authenticating as. So that step is actually not even configured to send from the user. So there might be two things. One, she's going to want to re-authenticate the database outgoing mail settings, but she might actually want to look at those automation plans. does she want them all coming from her since it's using her email address for the database or should become from the user that's moving them to that step so there's really two different issues going on so if we move them Robin if I move that to Intel one okay let's just say I'm doing that and it works where through Peggy's admin is Peggy's contact information showing up on that email then I'd have to look...
