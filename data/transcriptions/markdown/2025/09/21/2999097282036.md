## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello, this is Sharon. Hi, Sharon. It's Robin Mastroni with Main Sequence. Hey, Robin. How are you? I'm good. I got this form back. Okay. So what I wanted to ask you, now you're having the problem when you log in through PC Recruiter through a browser, correct? Say that again? Logging into PC Recruiter for what? Through the browser, like if you're going through Chrome? Yes. Okay. All right, so I wanted to ask you, is there a preference of what you want me to reset it to? A password, you mean? Yeah, or do you want me to just kind of make up something? Just make up something and send it to me, or I'll write it down right now. Okay, because I can make it be whatever you want as I'm in here, if you want me to set it how you want it to be anyway. But I didn't want to ask that in an email because I don't like doing that. Okay, let's use the email before that I thought I had that didn't stick. So at capital B, these are kind of complicated. It's a little sentence. So your username is S-T-S. Okay, so capital C. Yeah. And then dollar sign. The number four, number zero, backslash, small m. Oh, I wonder if the backslash could be a problem. Oh. I wonder if that could be it. Because sometimes like that kind of stuff interferes with code, especially like online stuff. Okay. Well, then let's just do. Is there when you had a problem as soon as you create a password with that? Is that when it started? Probably. I guess I don't know. This was clear over the last night or Saturday. Trying to get the new, all the stuff to work for my new business, my new desk has been a little challenging. So I guess I don't remember. Okay. So let's do it this way then. Capital B. Sorry. Start over. capital B, dollar sign, four, zero, lowercase m, the number four, capital D, capital F. That's eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah, it shouldn't really matter how many characters. Okay. Oh, okay. Well, unless you set your database to care about characters and stuff like that. There are certain things that you can't use, like it can't be part of your name, can't be the word password. I'm in a 1234 yeah yeah yeah you surprised some people do that like let me get like admin admin it's like oh yeah my husband you like for bank stuff he'll use our dog stop it's four letters you've got to make it more complicated than that okay so do me a favor try going into your database now and let me know if you can get in all right yeah I wonder if it didn't like that backslash that never even occurred to me and it should have it works okay perfect it totally works oh my gosh anything else connected to your database like PCR capture things like that make sure that you update those too because that can also cause the logout issues because it okay I don't trying to connect with you you're gosh you're right okay so sometimes when I go to get into a PCR and then I then I go to like I'm in LinkedIn recruiter and I go to do an update it doesn't it but the update part doesn't show so how do I know a PC capture okay I don't need a PCR capture extension at the top right of your browser? Yes. Okay, click on that. And does it say logout or anything like that? It's got a capture LinkedIn recruiter, LinkedIn recruiter light, LinkedIn sales, LinkedIn, and the career builder, and then logout. Okay, so hit logout at the bottom left. Okay. And then the PCR site URL popped up again it says login. Okay now does it say like ODBC and then your company name at the end? It says ODBC dot dot the words new company. So that means you haven't connected it to your database that's just like a sample so if you're in Peace Recruiter right now if you copy that URL that you use to get to your login page okay you have to paste that over on top of what you see if it's ending in my company okay the database oh you can just copy the whole URL that used to get your login page okay if I'm already it where where would the you are if I'm already in PCR like under basic search you know company name how do we How do I go back to the beginning? The URL at the very top, do you already have that copied? No, I can't even find it now. I have my PCR company name, position, roll-up, schedule. It should be above that. It'll say, like, https www.peacerecruiter.net, like that whole long URL of what you're actually, what you're on. Okay, so exec is what I, okay. You've got to copy that whole line, though. Alright, let's try that. Where did it go? So once you've copied your login URL, then click on the extension again. Go back to PC capture. Oh my goodness. Paste. Alright, let's see if it lets me log in. It says username. And that's where you'll pick S-T-S or type it in. Okay, and then the password. And then make sure you select your database name too. Oh, I popped up Thomas Agra. Okay, log in. I don't have Recruiter Lite or LinkedIn Sales. I have LinkedIn Recruiter, then I have Premium Recruiter. Do all of these things need to be on? I would leave them all selected because it might show that na...
