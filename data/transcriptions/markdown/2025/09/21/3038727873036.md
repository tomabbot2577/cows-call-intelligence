## 💬 Full Transcript

 Hello? Hi, this is Garrett with Main Sequence Technology. I have a voicemail here. You're having trouble in PCR. Is there anything I can help you with today? Yes. Yes. I've had this problem a few times now. I'm going to have to write down how to fix it because I don't remember every time it happens. But when I go to compose an email, it looks like it's a transparent box. Oh, yeah. Okay. So that usually happens if we push out tiny updates to the software. Some computers, for some reason, need a clearing of the cache on the browser to kind of fix those. So let me email you those instructions so you'll have a copy in case that happens again. Yeah, that would be good. Okay, good. Awesome. Yeah, I will send you those now. And that was just the main thing. It was when pop-ups appear, they're looking a little strange. Yes. Okay, perfect. I think this will fix it. Okay, great. All righty. Well, yeah, reach out if you're still having trouble, but I think that'll do it, and I'll email you right now. Okay, that's great. Thank you. Thanks. Bye. Bye....
